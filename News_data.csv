Dockless scooter company takes flight in Austin,Austin Monitor,,"Austin, TX",2018,4,6,"Dockless scooter company takes flight in Austin. For the third time in four years, a brand-new technology-enabled transportation company has set up shop on Austin’s streets without seeking the city’s official blessing.  On Thursday morning, the California-based company known as Bird released what one company official described as “a relatively small number” of its dockless electric scooters in parts of South and East Austin. David Estrada, Bird’s chief legal officer, would not disclose the exact amount but told the Austin Monitor, “There’s not thousands and not hundreds.”  Like the dockless bike-sharing model that was the focus of an Austin Transportation Department-sponsored community forum just one day before, Bird’s dockless scooters are free-floating vehicles that riders can unlock using their smartphones and rent by the minute.  Also like dockless bike-sharing, the city has no regulatory framework to deal with the scooters.  The focus of Wednesday morning’s forum was to begin a community discussion about the development of a pilot program for dockless bike-sharing that could be launched as early as this summer. ATD’s Active Transportation Program Manager Laura Dierenfield told the Monitor on Wednesday evening that dockless scooters likely would not be a part of that pilot.  On Thursday, Estrada said, “We just wanted to get something started so we can start gathering data on what usage looks like. … Our view is, oftentimes what happens is there’s an attempt to regulate before something gets to the market, and when you try to do that, you often create the wrong regulations because you really don’t know what the effects are yet.”  He insisted that the company had reviewed all relevant state laws and city ordinances before putting its scooters along South Congress Avenue, in East Austin and near the Zilker neighborhood.  “So we’re happily complying with the laws, and to the extent that the city later wants to regulate it, we’re happy to work with them on that process,” he told the Monitor.  Estrada said Bird came into existence just six months ago. The company has a presence in cities such as San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. It relies on teams of independent contractors to keep the scooters appropriately distributed and maintained.  The company says the contractors remove the scooters from their public perches each night starting at 8 p.m. for “storage, charging and necessary repair.” At 7 a.m., the contractors return the vehicles to businesses that have agreed to host the machines. Users can rent them from those establishments but are not required to return them there.  The question of how the scooters are parked on public right of way raises the same concerns that have dogged dockless bike-sharing. Estrada explained that the company uses “education” via its app to instruct riders how to properly abandon their rent-a-rides.  “We instruct them to drop them in the same places as you would see bikes parked or other scooters parked, to put them up against buildings, not blocking (the sidewalk),” he said.  The app also runs a tutorial about rider safety, a point that a fact sheet provided by a Bird spokesperson emphasizes as a company priority. That sheet states that the vehicles can only achieve a top speed of 15 miles per hour and are intended to be ridden in bike lanes or in the streets rather than on sidewalks.  Said Estrada: “The good news is that nobody’s gotten seriously injured in this kind of way yet.”  During a brief field trip to South Congress Avenue, the Monitor saw several people riding the scooters in both the bike lane and on the sidewalk. One group of young men were preoccupying themselves with three of the scooters near an Austin B-cycle dock on Elizabeth Street. When asked why they weren’t interested in the bikes, one of the youths explained that the service was too expensive. Were they electric, he added, they would reconsider.  Instead, they took turns zipping around the block on the scooters.  “Now that Toys ‘R’ Us is closed, you can’t go ride these around the store anymore,” one of the crew remarked.  Chris Parker, a tourist from Westchester, New York, explained that he had the app on his phone from a recent visit to California. While visiting the bustling shopping district on Thursday, he pulled out his phone, activated the app and was delighted to find the scooters nearby.  “This is making South Congress a lot of fun,” he said. “It’s a lot better than riding in a car.”  That sentiment plays into the purpose that Estrada said Bird wants to fulfill. Its spontaneity and ease of use, he explained, could reduce automobile reliance.  “I think what it shows is how much people need this kind of thing to complete those 1- or 2-mile trips that they’re currently doing with Lyft or Uber that are putting lots of cars on the road,” he elaborated.  Bird’s sudden entrance into Austin’s increasingly diverse mobility scene echoed two prior incursions by app-based services. The state ultimately created a final framework governing transportation network companies after Uber and Lyft sparked a years-long battle when they rushed into town in 2014. The ongoing development of a dockless bike-sharing pilot is meant to address pressure from that industry after several companies briefly burst onto the scene during the South by Southwest festival in 2017 before ATD shut them down.  In early March of this year, Bird signaled an imminent launch in Austin when it began posting ads for independent contractors on Craigslist.  Estrada said the company had communicated with the city, including meetings with City Council members. After reaching out to the 10 district representatives on Thursday, the Monitor was only able to confirm with Council Member Ellen Troxclair’s office that any such meeting had taken place. According to an aide, no details about Bird’s upcoming launch were discussed.  An ATD spokesperson also said that the department had no previous discussions with the company prior to Thursday. However, after the scooters were deployed, city staff met with Bird officials to discuss “how to move forward.”  A statement released on Thursday evening following the meeting did not indicate any impending action to disable or impound the company’s scooters.  “It is important that all businesses occupying the public right of way do so under the proper permits and procedures so they do not present a public safety hazard,” the statement read. “We are excited about welcoming any new and innovative ideas to Austin’s transportation scene and look forward to supporting these ideas in compliance with state and local law.”  That lined up with what Council Member Ann Kitchen, chair of Council’s Mobility Committee, told the Monitor.  “My hope is that they understand that the city of Austin is a city that’s innovative and that we are all about working with transportation companies on options. But that requires the companies to work with us,” said Kitchen, who also noted that the company did not reach out to her office.  Bird appears to be ready to offer the city an incentive to keep it on the streets. Estrada said the company will save $1 per each of its scooters operating on the streets per day. The company will offer that sum to the city as revenue for future safety improvements.  He explained: “Cities sometimes will say, ‘How can we control the number of these vehicles?’ And the way we think about that is, we think that’s the wrong question. The right question is, ‘How do we get more of these vehicles on the road and more cars off the road?’ And there is an infrastructure component to that.”  The Austin Monitor’s work is made possible by donations from the community.

The scooter rental company first launched their vehicles in Austin back in April without the city's permission and were pulled off the streets after officials passed an ordinance. Bird will now join Pace, another scooter and bike rental company, who launched their bikes on Monday and were granted a permit last week. A spokesperson with the Austin Transportation Department said Pace was granted approval for 219 permits for bikes at the cost of $30 each. Bird has permission to operate 500 scooters under the city rules and must prove that each device is being rented at least twice per day. Austin Transportation has prepared for the dockless scooters and bikes to hit the streets by painting parking zones for the vehicles on sidewalks throughout Austin. The parking zones can be found at the following locations: Third Street between Nueces and San Antonio. Trinity at Third Street. Fourth Street at San Jacinto. Fourth Street at Red River Road. San Jacinto between Fifth and Sixth Street. A source familiar with Bird said the company expects to have their units back on the streets by Wednesday. According to the Austin Transportation Department, both Bird and LimeBike, another dockless scooter company, had to pay fees to cover earlier city costs of impounding their units -- Bird owed about $29,000 while LimeBike owed $13,000.

Bird scooters return to Austin after being pulled from the streets,kxan,NBC,"Austin, TX",2018,5,23,"Bird scooters return to Austin after being pulled from the streets. For a few weeks in April, scooters descended on the city of Austin as a number of companies put electric transportation on the streets. Then, overnight, they vanished after the city passed emergency regulations related to permitting on April 27. Now at least some of them are back. Bird, one of the first companies to release a fleet in Austin, announced that service resumed Wednesday. The company currently has permission to operate up to 500 scooters. “Bird has a network trained chargers and mechanics ready to go in Austin. Each night, Birds are picked up for storage, charging, and any necessary repair,” a spokesperson for Bird explained in an email, saying that these staff members help to keep the scooters from cluttering sidewalks. The Texas Capitol asked Bird to not have people ride or park nearby, so the scooters are not allowed on Capitol grounds and the app has been educating riders about the specifics since mid-April. Under Austin’s new ordinance, scooters have to be permitted or they will be impounded. The scooters will also all have a sticker which indicates sample scooters from that group have been tested and that the company who owns the scooters paid any fines owed to the city. How Austin wants to regulate new electric scooters. Starting in August, the vehicles will also have to be locked down to something. They’ll also need to have a reminder-system within the app or the vehicle itself to promote good behavior, like parking in the right location. These companies have to report their bike usage numbers to the transportation department and if a device is not being used two times a day, the city is at liberty to ask the company to remove it. Bird owed the city of Austin $29,000 in violations from when the city’s emergency ordinance went into effect and LimeBike owed the city around $15,000 for violations. The companies will need to remain in good standing to keep their permits with the city. The city has the right to cancel any permits if the companies don’t follow through, but the transportation department says they hope to do everything possible to make sure all parties have a cooperative relationship. Austin designed its regulations after hearing directly from cities like San Francisco and Seattle about the challenges they’d experienced, like scooters being parked improperly or left where people are walking and driving. While scooters were in the area, the University of Texas Police Department received numerous complaints and warned many people about unsafe riding. “How we avoid that is to really provide people with some expectations for where they can and a can’t go, so in our rules we have designated areas and we’ve asked companies to make sure they really communicate that to their users,” explained Laura Dierenfield, division manager for the city’s active transportation and street design. “It’s cool to see that they’re back,” said Sean Callahan, a bike courier in Austin. “I think its really healthy for people to get outside, find another form of transportation other than a car.” Callahan is hoping that Austinites take care of the scooters on the streets. “I’d like to think the people in Austin are pretty cool and chill and don’t want to give a bad experience for someone who’s just trying to do something with scooters,” he said. Bird will typically give $1 per scooter per day to the city they’re in to support improvements for things like bike lanes. But as the city of Austin could not accept the money, Bird will donate instead to Movability, an Austin-based Transportation Management Association that helps coordinate public and private sector mobility options. “I even did it and I’ve never been on a scooter in my life, I had to have a millennial help me,” laughed Lisa Kay Pfannenstiel, executive director of Movability, which is a member-based nonprofit. Movability works with several employers to get employees around and to eliminate congestion in the city. She explained that Bird called her this week and told her about their donation plan. “I feel very honored, we’re always looking for a variety of solutions to decrease congestion and this is just one piece of the puzzle,” she said. Kay Pfannenstiel said that her nonprofit doesn’t vouch for any particular policy, rather they support anything that improves Austin congestion and gives people more options to link up with mass transit. On Monday, dockless bike company Pace rolled out their bikes in Austin. The city says Pace and Bird are the only two programs that have gotten permits so far under the new process. These permits are up for renewal after six months. Pace began the week with 60 bikes and will have 150 by the end of the week. By the end of summer, the plan to have 500 bikes. “As these devices roll out and we find out more information about the patterns of usage, we’ll be deploying more parking areas in response,” explained Jesse Duncan, a street designer with the Austin Transportation Department. ATD said it has been challenging working with the sudden influx of these publicly accessible, privately run vehicles. But they also see these scooters and bikes as an opportunity to solve what they call “the last mile problem”: getting Austinites transportation on the last stretch of their commute from a bus stop or train station to their home. This week the city placed 5 marked parking areas downtown for the scooters to show people the best spots to park the devices. “Just consider whenever you park this device, is this going to interrupt anyone else’s trip? Is it going to get in their way? Are they going to trip over it?” Duncan advised. If you see problems with the scooters or how they’re used, the city wants to keep track as well, they ask you to report what you experience to 311. The city even developed a code of ethics for the use of these dockless vehicles: ???????1. Pedestrians First – People operating bicycles and scooters shall yield to pedestrians on sidewalks. 2. Parking Responsibly – Units shall be parked in a secure upright position only in designated areas. 3. Stay on Right of Way –  Users should not take units to areas where they are not authorized to operate, such as private property, parkland, state-owned land or other unauthorized areas. 4. Know What You’re Sharing – Users have access to dockless mobility services without having to share Personally Identifiable Information and have the opportunity to Opt-In to sharing this information only after getting clear information about what type of information will be shared. 5. Right and Report – If you see a unit toppled over or parked improperly; help out by righting the unit and reporting the issue via 311.",https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/bird-scooters-return-to-austin-after-being-pulled-from-the-streets/
Say hello to Goat: Homegrown Austin startup enters dockless scooter race,Austin Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Austin, TX",2018,5,25,"Say hello to Goat: Homegrown Austin startup enters dockless scooter race. Goat is the third ""dockless"" company to launch in Austin, and the only one that's based here. Now that there's a legal framework for grab-and-go scooters in Austin, expect to see a lot more of the two-wheeled vehicles motoring around the urban core. Add Austin-based Goat Labs Inc. to the list of companies elbowing into the field. The company announced Thursday it had received its license from the city and is now putting its purple and black scooters around its hometown. Dockless scooters from Bird and LimeBike first started popping up on Austin's streets in early April. In a situation similar to when Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. entered Austin a couple of years ago, city officials were caught off guard and scrambled to come up with regulations for the disruptive scooter startups. Goat, however, stayed on the sidelines and told the ABJ recently that playing by the rules has put it at a competitive disadvantage. Austin passed on April 27 new rules for dockless bikes and scooters, including a $30 fee per vehicle for a pilot period of six months. Pace dockless bikes were the first to appear on Austin streets after the new laws were approved, followed this week by Bird scooters. Dockless scooters don't have a central collection point. They can be parked almost anywhere, as long as they comply with parts of the new rules about avoiding right of way. Customers simply walk up and unlock the scooters with their phones. Jennie Whitaker, chief marketing officer and co-founder of Goat, said it has received licenses for 500 scooters, the maximum allowed under city law — although companies can put more scooters on the streets in areas that lack transit options, such as East Austin. With each license costing $30, that's an upfront regulatory cost of $15,000 without figuring in the expenses to maintain the scooters and pay people to recharge them at night. Goat will deploy 20 scooters at a time, Techcrunch reports. It costs $1 to ride one of its scooters, plus 15 cents per minute. Much as RideAustin has done in the ridesharing sector, Goat is harping on its local roots, touting how it is the first U.S. company not based in California to field a fleet of dockless electric scooters, ""proving once again the prowess of Austin, as a leader in technology and sustainability."" CEO Michael Schramm went even further, calling out Bird and LimeBike, although not by name: ""In April we watched two California-based companies enter our market, ignore the balance, and exploit the policies and patience of our local city government but today we're thankful for the due diligence the City of Austin put into place to ensure dockless mobility is a viable option to support their long-term objectives that we've worked to support."" That could appeal to customers in Austin, which is known for supporting local brands. But Goat faces some deep-pocket competitors: Bird, led by former exec at Uber and Lyft, has raised some $118 million in funding and LimeBike has brought in $132 million. And that's not even taking into consideration Ofo, the China-based dockless bike company that earlier this year brought in $866 million in its latest funding round and has more than 10 million yellow bicycles on the roads in 250 cities globally; it plans to soon launch in Austin Goat has been bootstrapped so far. Whitaker said the four co-founders have put a combined $250,000 into the business.

""With cities imposing vendor caps and an insatiable demand for dockless scooters, the scooter market is still wide open and we are actively looking for investors who believe in the future of transportation-as-a-service."" Like the other electric scooter companies, Goat said it can help reduce congestion on the roads, reduce carbon emissions and alleviate parking challenges — why fret over finding parking for your lunch meeting when you can find take a scooter and leave it on the sidewalk outside? Along with Schramm and Whitaker, the other co-founders of Goat are Chief Technology Officer Munjal Badhabbhatti and Chief Operating Officer Marcus Whitaker. The declared in the Thursday announcement that Austin is just the initial foray in an ""imminent and aggressive multi-city rollout."" Whitaker declined to specify when that rollout might occur but said Goat is ""in discussions with multiple cities, but this is a process we are patiently navigating."" ""As you saw in Austin, it requires a lot of gumption, but also a sincere ability to sit and wait if you want to do things the right way,"" Whitaker said by email. ""To do this the right way, it requires patience, partnership and collaboration, which means we're going to make the decision on where to go next at the exact right time and in the most precise way in order to rollout a solution that is sustainable.""",https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2018/05/25/say-hello-to-goat-homegrown-austin-startup-enters.html
"E-bikes, e-scooters not welcome in Austin parks",Austin Monitor,,"Austin, TX",2018,7,9,"E-bikes, e-scooters not welcome in Austin parks. Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department would like to remind parkgoers to observe the speed limit.  In a June memo to Mayor Steve Adler and City Council, department Director Kimberly McNeeley pointed out that city code prohibits the use of motorized vehicles, including e-bikes, e-scooters and Segways, within public recreation areas. That includes parks, trails, greenbelts and other public spaces. McNeeley wrote that the parks department is planning a two-week public outreach effort that will include friendly reminders from park rangers and new warning signs.  In recent months, urban transportation startups such as Bird, Pace, Goat and Lime (and now JUMP) seeded Austin streets with hundreds of dockless bikes and scooters, and some of their patrons used those vehicles on Austin’s hike and bike trails. With their electric motors, e-bikes and e-scooters can reach speeds much higher than pedestrians can walk or jog.  That left some of the slower trailblazers feeling unsafe, and they voiced their complaints to the parks department. “Last week, we had an increase in inquiries from the public asking if these scooters were allowed on parkland and allowed on bike trails,” said Ricardo Soliz, acting assistant director of the department.  According to Section 8-1-31 of the city code’s Parks Administration chapter, the answer is no. There are a few exceptions: Individuals with disabilities may use Segways and motorized wheelchairs in parks, and e-bikes are allowed on the Emma Long Metropolitan Park motorcycle trails.  Taking an e-bike or e-scooter onto parkland would be an easy mistake to make – the electric motor makes all the difference. “I think people probably don’t know,” Soliz said. “It’s just something new that we’re seeing a lot of, and it seems recreation-related.”  Soliz noted that e-bikes and e-scooters pose potential safety hazards when driven on hike and bike trails. “The scooters and e-bikes can go anywhere from 15 to 25 miles per hour – just the speed and the volume of people, particularly on the hike and bike trail and certain portions of the trail, could be dangerous,” he said, citing the danger to slow-moving pedestrians and people with strollers, especially at pinch points where the trail narrows.  Department spokesperson Shelley Parks said the prohibition on motorized vehicles has been in effect since 1992, and that it hadn’t been much of an issue until recently, when e-bikes and e-scooters exploded in popularity. Parks added that the vehicles are also “not good for the park grounds,” meaning the greenbelts and green spaces the department is in charge of in addition to the hike and bike trails.  The department will place warning signs on the Ann and Roy Butler trail to remind visitors not to use motorized vehicles. These will be temporary – Soliz likened them to yard signs for real estate listings – until the department can install permanent signage. Soliz hinted at a new symbol just for e-bikes and e-scooters. “We certainly don’t want to have more signs up just for sign clutter,” he said, “but maybe a symbol of some sort that … communicates electric or battery-operated or something like that. Maybe a circular kind of symbol that we can add to our existing signs.”  According to the department, park rangers will issue warnings, but only park police and the Austin Police Department can issue citations.  So far, the crackdown doesn’t seem to be affecting e-bike or e-scooter companies, according to Marissa Monroy, spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department. They haven’t reduced their numbers of permitted scooters or bikes. “No companies have been like, ‘Oh, I’m going to return half the scooters because we don’t really need them anymore since they’re not allowed in parks,’” she said.  As for changing the code? Soliz is open to that. “I think we’re going to have some kind of bigger discussion about that,” he said. He added that e-bikes and e-scooters could be permitted “on the trails that are much wider, where we can see more of a separation of bikes versus pedestrians, where there’s a little more thought in that separation.”",https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2018/07/e-bikes-e-scooters-not-welcome-in-austin-parks/

Austin's new scooter rules could evolve next month with city leaders' return, but transportation officials want riders who are new to using scooters and bikes in Austin to know the rules of the road. By and large, the regulations are the same they've always been but expanded to include electric scooters. Some of the apps require riders to take a picture of how they left the equipment afterward to make sure it's parked near a bike rack or bench instead of blocking traffic. Officials prefer riders use bike lanes to get around, especially in downtown where there's so much foot traffic. ""Sidewalks are not the most visible and predictable place to be if you are on a bicycle or scooter,"" said Laura Dierenfield of Austin Transportation Department.

"Dockless Scooters Present Pitfalls (And Potholes) For Police, Pedestrians – And Insurers",KUT,NPR,"Austin, TX",2018,11,19,"Dockless Scooters Present Pitfalls (And Potholes) For Police, Pedestrians – And Insurers. Dockless electric scooters have been for rent on Austin streets legally since May. Love them or hate them, they present some interesting legal questions for city officials, police and insurance companies. Those questions persist as the number of so-called e-scooters grows.  The e-scooter company Lime says Austin riders have taken more than 1 million rides on its scooters since June. It has 500 scooters on the road, with plans for as many as 4,500. Bird has more than 500 scooters in Austin, and Jump – a subsidiary of Uber and the newest entrant here – has 1,000 scooters.  All those scooters are competing for space on busy roads and walkways.  And, because riders are largely inexperienced, that usually means accidents. But, since we’re in the early stages of the city’s scooter regulations, the question of who’s at fault in scooter accidents isn’t as clear-cut as you would think.  Last month, KUT host and producer Rebecca McInroy learned this the hard way while leaving a parking garage on UT's campus.  ""Driving out, I put my parking pass in, waved to the attendant that was there,"" she said. ""I slowed down, stopped looked to my right to make sure no one would hit me. Then suddenly I hear this ‘woo-poosh!' And I see this guy fly on to my car and then jump around, and he was on a scooter. So, I see the scooter lying there.""  At that point, things proceeded as they would normally after a crash. Police and EMS were called. The man on the scooter was injured, but declined to leave in an ambulance.   McInroy said the police told her they see a lot of these types of accidents, but don't know what to do.  ""They see a lot of accidents with scooters and they don’t know if they’re supposed to ticket them if they’re riding on the sidewalk,"" she said. ""They don’t know if they’re supposed to ticket them for not wearing helmets. They don’t know what the protocol is when they are in an accident."" Austin Police Sgt. Michael Barger said a lot of this is new for any officer – but it's expecially difficult for the department's newer ones.  ""You have the brand-new officer, who just got out of the academy and they may teach about scooters in the academy, so he’s going to be knowledgeable,"" he said. ""Then you have a guy who has been out for a year and came out just before scooters came out, and he has no idea how to handle a scooter [incident]. And then you have officers with more experience and going, 'Well, that’s a bicycle.' They’re understanding that a scooter is handled just like a bicycle. It’s just a logical process for them.""  Right now, the State of Texas considers e-scooters the equivalent of bikes: They have two wheels, go under 30 miles an hour and can be operated with little training. Also, theoretically, there is less risk of injury.  ""In medical coding now, there is a very specific code for two-wheeled, motorized scooters,"" said Dr. Melinda McMichael, interim director at the University Health Center at UT Austin. ""So, it’s very distinct from motorcycles, bicycles, un-motorized scooters, skateboards, so there’s a very specific code.""  McMichael said her clinic has been keeping tabs on scooter injuries that come through her facility since school started. The number of incidents has grown every month: 26 in September, 32 in October and 22 as of Nov. 15 with two more weeks to go in the month.  ""What we normally see people for are knee injuries, sprained ankles, lacerations, abrasions, head injuries,"" McMichael said. ""But I’d think it’s important to point out that this doesn’t count the people that went straight to the emergency room. So, my guess is the numbers are much higher than this.""  Barger thinks the scooters help get cars off the road, but there might be more restrictions on them down the road because of those injuries. ""You have people that are getting on these scooters,"" he said. ""They have no experience riding them. They get up to 15 to 20 miles an hour. It’s a dangerous mode of transportation – mainly because it’s got a high center of gravity, because you are standing up as you ride on it. And if you hit a pothole, you’re going to go over the handlebars on it.""  But until something changes, the law is murky on scooters.  The University of Texas Police Department has not issued citations for scooter-related offenses – unless it was particularly egregious. The department is trying to educate riders that they must follow the rules of the road, since scooters are vehicles. That is, unless scooters are involved in a crash with a motorized vehicle.  ""The way they see the scooters is almost like a pedestrian or a bicyclist, because they’re not required by law to carry liability insurance,"" said UTPD Officer Robert Rodriguez. ""It becomes a civil matter at that point between the driver of the vehicle and the person riding the scooter.""  Scooter companies all carry liability insurance that protects the company. There’s no comprehensive insurance that would cover the damage that a scooter can cause. The companies don’t cover the rider at all. And there’s a good chance that, even if you have a solid homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy, you’re not covered for any damages here either.  ""None of the insurance you have currently is probably going to help you,"" said Jason Hargraves, managing editor for InsuranceQuotes.com. ""Because your homeowner's policy does carry with you for some instances, for liability purposes, except when it involves a motorized vehicle. And that’s exactly what a scooter is.""  So, in the eyes of homeowner-policy issuers, the scooter is a motor vehicle. McInroy's SUV had a large dent on the left side and her driver side door was hard to open because things were out of place. She called her auto insurance company to file a claim.  ""They didn’t really know what to do about it,"" she said. ""They said, ‘We’re not really sure what to file this under, but we will contact him.’ Then when I called back to check in on it, they said they forgot where it was, because it had been filed under a motorcycle accident, because they didn’t really understand how to classify the scooter idea.""   But then, days later, it took a turn.  ""[The insurance agent] said ‘We have to wait for the police report, because [the scooter rider] said that you hit him,’"" she said. ""And I was taken aback because he hit the side of the car, so, really I could not have hit him. But, having said that I hit him, that would make it my fault, and they said then it would be on my file as hitting a pedestrian, which is not a good thing to have on your record.""  But then McInroy remembered the garage attendant mentioned the crash would have been recorded by the security cameras.   ""Then I sent that to my insurance company,"" McInroy. ""After [the agent] watched it she said, ‘Uhh, clearly he’s at fault.’""  She was still out a deductible, but there's no huge scar on her file.  It’s final classification? The guy on the scooter – was an uninsured motorist.",https://www.kut.org/post/dockless-scooters-present-pitfalls-and-potholes-police-pedestrians-and-insurers
Austin’s B-cycle was riding high. Then scooters came to town.,Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2018,11,20,"Austin’s B-cycle was riding high. Then scooters came to town. Dockless scooters and bikes, suddenly a fixture in Austin’s urban core, are squeezing out the city’s original street bike rental program. B-cycle, the dock-based bike rental program owned by the city of Austin, has seen a sharp decrease in rides taken in most parts of the city since dockless transportation first began to appear on Austin streets this spring, said Elliott McFadden, who runs Bike Share of Austin, the nonprofit that has operated B-cycle on behalf of the city since 2013. “It’s definitely impacted the overall ridership and sustainability of the system, and that’s something we’ve tracked and is a direct correlation to the number of (dockless) vehicles that have been permitted. Each time the city allows a new vendor in, we do see a new dip in ridership,” he said, noting that B-cycle remains competitive around the University of Texas. The nonprofit started offering free rides to students in February. In October, slightly more than 9,000 rides were taken by people who weren’t UT students, compared with just more than 20,000 rides in October 2017, according to B-cycle data. B-cycle revenue and ridership downtown has dropped 40 percent since the beginning of the year, McFadden said. The city and the nonprofit renewed a contract for five years this spring, following five years of relative success. B-cycle has covered most of its operating costs through membership fees, McFadden said. Amid dropping revenue, B-cycle has been forced to lean heavily on revenue generated from advertisements displayed on the bikes and docks, McFadden said. The city does not subsidize the system, but it does own all of the bikes and docks, totaling about $2.5 million in equipment that was acquired mostly through federal grants. The city has spent roughly $600,000 on B-cycle. Most of that has gone to expanding the system, with about $190,000 for discounted and free passes and memberships for city employees, UT students and low-income residents. Federal grants covered much of the expansion costs, according to transportation department officials. ‘OK with some competition’. In April, scooter companies Bird and Lime moved into town, first without city permission, then returning in May under new city guidelines for dockless transportation. Five other private companies, including Uber’s dockless experiment Jump, have since entered the fray, creating a suddenly crowded transportation market. From July through September, 245,000 rides were taken using dockless transportation in downtown Austin, or roughly 27 percent of the slightly less than 900,000 rides taken across the city during that time, according to a Transportation Department memo. For comparison, B-cycle tracked 90,000 rides in its entire system during that same period, according to data provided by McFadden. “We were tracking, even without the students, a really good year until dockless showed up, and dockless has definitely taken a big bite out of our ridership,” McFadden said. “But also, being a nonprofit and a city partnership, we don’t have to put up the same kind of numbers the scooters have to put up to be sustainable, so we’re OK with some competition.” Jason JonMichael, Austin’s assistant director of transportation, said officials are working to ensure dockless transportation doesn’t disrupt public transportation. “What we’re seeing is the natural progression of mobility as a service in the active transportation landscape,” JonMichael said. “A lot of us already knew that a lot of these other modes were coming and that the private sector was going to be delivering them. What we’re dealing with right now is better understanding the usage, as well as what outcomes are we seeing from the addition of dockless mobility into our existing active transportation landscape.” But Council Member Kathie Tovo said she was concerned about B-cycle’s declining usage. ?(B-cycle) is an important service that the city has partnered with a nonprofit to provide, and of course we want to continue to see it be successful, so those numbers are kind of alarming,” said Tovo, whose district covers much of the areas where scooter and B-cycle use is highest, including South Congress Avenue, downtown and UT. Tovo, who said she was unaware of B-cycle’s recent struggles until reached by the American-Statesman, said it was still too early to know how the service would cope with the influx of dockless transportation. “It’s only been a matter of months at this point, really, so it’s still super early to make any decisions based on that information,” Tovo said. “We’ve been struggling to catch up and look at the rules (for dockless transportation) and decide what the regulations should be and see how people are using them and how we might need to regulate them. It’s all just evolving.” Priced out. Lime, Bird and Jump charge $1 to start a ride on a scooter, followed by 15 cents per minute for the remainder of the ride. Jump also offers dockless bicycles that cost $2 for 30 minutes and 7 cents a minute after that. All of these are cheaper options for shorter rides than B-cycle, which offers time-based memberships ranging from $12 for 24 hours to $80 for a full year, according to its website. B-cycle is also beginning to experiment with pricing on a per-ride basis, McFadden said, with 30-minute rides costing $3. But for James Hall, who works downtown for Facebook and has ridden dockless scooters and B-cycle bikes, it isn’t the cost that has caused him to switch modes of transportation. “The bikes are heavy, they’re clunky and I know they’re built for industrial use, but they really just need to replace them with something smaller and easier that works,” Hall said. “The scooters do that. When I’m downtown, I want to be able to get somewhere and go.” To better compete with the increasing numbers of dockless scooters and bicycles, B-cycle introducing e-bikes, or electric bicycles that assist riders with pedaling, McFadden said. Ten new e-bikes are part of a three-month trial. McFadden said B-cycle is planning to unveil new programs to better compete with dockless transportation, but he wouldn’t provide details. Regardless of the new competition, Kara Kockelman, a transportation engineering professor at UT, said Austin was well-positioned for the future because of its dock-based bike program. “Transit agencies should be partnering, and shifting to smaller vehicles,” Kockelman said. “In this way, they use their budgets more effectively.” McFadden said he still isn’t sold on the long-term sustainability of dockless scooters and bikes in Austin. “We’re still at the stage of seeing how this plays out, and I think that scooters are an industry that is less than a year old,” McFadden said. “They could be class-action lawsuit away from not having an industry anymore ... . It’s very early to say whether this is the future or not, but it honestly feels like a fad in a bubble.”",https://www.statesman.com/news/20181120/austins-b-cycle-was-riding-high-then-scooters-came-to-town
Electric Scooters And Bikes Will Be Coming To Some Austin Trails Starting Next Month,KUT,NPR,"Austin, TX",2018,11,27,"Electric Scooters And Bikes Will Be Coming To Some Austin Trails Starting Next Month. A discarded Lime-S scooter at Mabel Davis Park on Nov. 26. Austin trail-goers may encounter more electric scooters starting next month.  The Austin Parks and Recreation Department is launching a pilot program that will allow the e-scooters and e-bikes to ride on certain trails to better determine how riders can share trails with runners and cyclists in the future.  Amanda Ross, a manager with the Parks and Recreation department who's overseeing the pilot, says the scooters have been cropping up on trails since the city allowed them to operate in Austin in May. Currently, city code classifies certain bikes and e-scooters from companies like Lime, Jump and Bird as motor vehicles, and they aren't allowed on trails.  ""What we’re trying to do is really understand how we could allow them, or not allow them, based on results we get,"" Ross said of the project, which is still in the planning stages ahead of a mid-December launch.  She says the pilot will monitor all electric scooters and bikes­– not just those owned by dockless mobility companies.  The pilot will run for roughly nine months through fall of next year. Parks and Recreation will survey trail-users, update signage, track crash reports and monitor electric bike and scooter speeds, which is currently limited to 10 mph. The program will also include a ""trail etiquette education campaign"" to teach users how to properly use the electric bikes and scooters.  “We’ve gotten feedback on both sides – people who are interested in using them and people who are very concerned about their use,"" Ross said.  The City of Austin will implement the pilot for both e-bikes and e-scooters on four trails:      Johnson Creek Greenbelt Trail     Shoal Creek Greenbelt Trail     Northern Walnut Creek Trail     Southern Walnut Creek Trail  The Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail is also included in the pilot program, but the city will only allow e-bikes to operate on the trail.  City staff said the Butler Trail exemption was prompted by public opposition to e-scooters because of safety concerns and community opposition.  The Parks and Recreation Department, which is working in conjunction with the Law Department, Public Works and the Transportation Department, is expected to launch a website with more information on the program in the next few weeks.  ""Consider this an opportunity to have your voice heard,"" said Ross. ""Tell us your feedback and let us know because it’s important.""  Dockless bikes and scooters began officially rolling out on to Austin streets this year, starting with bikes in February. Scooters outpaced that growth quickly, but have also prompted safety concerns and sidewalk congestion.  E-scooter operator Bird began operating without city permission in April, prompting Lime to follow suit. The city eventually sped up its pilot program process, approving the operators later that month ahead of a May rollout. Jump, a subsidiary of ride-hailing giant Uber, deployed its fleet of dockless scooters last month.  Lime says Austin riders have taken more than 1 million rides on its scooters since June. It has 500 scooters on the road, with plans for as many as 4,500.

Austin's electric scooters injury count comes in higher than expected,CBS Austin,CBS,"Austin, TX",2018,12,12,"Austin's electric scooters injury count comes in higher than expected. Alarming new numbers from Dell Seton Medical Center show scooters may be a bigger health risk than originally thought. Just last week, the CDC announced that Austin is the site of its first-ever study on scooter safety and injuries. Investigators are looking at 68 scooter injuries recorded over a two-month period in Austin this fall, but the head of the Emergency Department at Dell Seton says he sees that many scooter injuries in a week. If there is anyone who sees scooters a little differently, it is Dr. Christopher Ziebell. “Hitting concrete with your head at 20 miles an hour is no different than getting hit in the head with a baseball bat,” he said. “I know that here at Dell Seton, we see about a scooter injury a shift and we have 11 doctor shifts a day.” That's everything from bumps and scrapes to broken bones and worse. There's one hospital admission about every other day. And one person sent to the intensive care unit every week. Since scooters were introduced to Austin in May -- Dell Seton counts 47 severe traumas. That's 15 head injuries. 25 orthopedic injuries. 7 facial injuries. Some of the patients will never be the same. “We have had some folks who will need lifelong support -- nursing homes and that sort of thing because of scooters,’ said Dr. Ziebell. Close to city hall downtown, we flagged down Andrew Spicer on a scooter. “I go throughout downtown pretty frequently and it's a lot more convenient than getting a car,” he said. I asked him about safety, and he has thought about it. “Only ride during the day,” he said. “They also have postings of certain streets that you should be on the bike lane versus on the side walk.” And Spicer says he is vigilant about everything around him while he is riding. But that's not enough for Dr. Ziebell, who expects his department will treat dozens of more injuries this week alone. “If you're going to ride a scooter regularly, invest in a helmet and strap it to your backpack and just get used to putting your helmet on when you ride the scooter,” he said. I checked with St. David’s and Baylor Scott and White, and neither of them track scooter related patient visits. Austin City Council is expected to meet in the spring to possibly take action on scooter safety.",https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/austins-electric-scooters-injury-count-comes-in-higher-than-expected
Austin man asking Lime for damage repayment after scooter falls off juicer's truck,CBS Austin,CBS,"Austin, TX",2018,12,28,"Austin man asking Lime for damage repayment after scooter falls off juicer's truck. Wednesday night's torrential downpours made driving conditions dangerous, but for J.J. Castillo, those conditions were made worse when a Lime scooter fell off the back of the truck in front of him. Castillo was driving to get dinner when he found himself behind the truck of someone picking up Lime scooters to charge - known as a juicer. One scooter fell off the top of the pile in the bed of the truck, and before Castillo could react, he ran it over. ""It was just a big clunk. I could tell something was weebly-wobbly driving forward,"" Castillo said. The scooter bent two rims and flattened tires, but there may be more damages. Castillo has not brought his car into the shop yet, because he's waiting to see how Lime will handle this. He spent all day Friday trying to get Lime to pay for repairs. ""I just don't want to be stuck with the bill,"" Castillo said. ""It was really bad weather conditions that night. If the scooter had fallen out closer to my car, or gotten airborne and gone through my windshield, who knows what."" Austin Police are investigating this as a leaving the scene of a crash case, because the juicer drove away without checking on Castillo. CBS Austin reached out to Lime. They say they are looking into this case, talking with Castillo, and making an insurance claim. One lawyer says because juicers are independent contractors, Lime may not be liable for this, but he also says this model could be problematic for the company down the line. ""If they're not giving anyone any training, and just says, 'Hey, go out and pick some scooters,' I think that could bring more liability to Lime Scooter in that instance,"" said Jack Zinda. Castillo is hoping this gets resolved soon. However, he also wants other drivers to be aware when driving behind a juicer. ""It is a contractor, an employee for them - an agent - making a mistake and putting everyone of us in the way of danger.""",https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/austin-man-asking-lime-for-damage-repayment-after-scooter-falls-off-juicers-truck
The year in scooters and bikes,Curbed Austin,Curbed,"Austin, TX",2019,1,1,"The year in scooters and bikes. This story was first published on December 18 and has been updated to include information from Lime’s year-end report. It’s no understatement: Dockless mobility was one of the biggest issues to dominate civic discussion, public and private, this year. To put it more bluntly, if a little reductively: Electric scooters—people love ‘em or hate ‘em, and passions on both sides ran high this year as the zippy little rentables (and, to a lesser extent, dockless electric bikes) took to Austin streets in rather dramatic fashion in 2018. After a rough start that involved the initial exclusion of scooters in city forums about a pilot dockless bicycle program and the illegal deployment of scooters that followed, things got sorted quickly, and the city had some licensing and regulations in place by April (though Lime in particular continues to be cheeky about flouting the rules). By November, the city was experimenting with allowing bikes and scooters on some hike-and-bike trails, where motorized vehicles have previously been forbidden. Austin was hardly the only U.S. city to experience the dockless wave, it is the first one in which the CDC is conducting a related safety study. The city included some nifty charts and stats when it announced the study—ones that will do just fine doubling as approximate year-end figures for those who want to dig in to the local dockless story so far. What the city has to say? How many dockless and scooters and bikes are out there? According to the city’s Mobility Committee, there are: 7 licensed operators (Bird, Lime, Lyft, and Jump (Uber), Spin, and student-oriented VeoRide). 11,001 authorized scooters. 850 authorized bikes. 65 square miles of service area.The report notes that licensed operators are allowed to serve any area within the city’s jurisdiction, but it the focus of operators’s initially allowed 500 units will stay primarily in the project’s designated downtown areas that are included in the total serve-area square mileage. How many people are riding those things? The city’s chart below contains some interesting numbers regarding number, distance, length, and time of rides for October 2018. Scooter trips far outnumber those taken on dockless shared bicycles. How does dockless bike and scooter safety compare to that of other modes of transportation? The first CDC study of that is taking place in Austin, so we don’t yet have an answer for that one. However, the city did release preliminary numbers for October 2018, which will be included in the CDC study. Shown on the chart below, they indicate far more reported motor vehicle injuries and fatalities that month. What’s next? The Mobility Committee announced two projects to address issues around dockless mobility: Dockless Ordinance Refresh. Aligning the business model and fee structure to offset infrastructure and other needs. Investigating an Operating Authority Model to better manage total number of companies and maximum fleet sizes. Liability & Discovery – methodology and tools to hold users and companies accountable, where appropriate. Safe Riding Ordinance. Austin Transportation Department is analyzing data to develop a location-specific ordinance that would include safe and reasonable riding speeds and locations for all users. ATD will propose Dismount Zones, and other safety requirements for ALL riders, regardless of modal type. The outcomes of this work will be used to inform the development of a Safe Riding Ordinance. Clear indications of what is considered a riding violation making it easier to enforce. Lime rolls out some numbers. Lime, which has the second-highest number of dockless vehicles operating in Austin right now, issued a year-end report this week that focuses on other aspects of the dockless vehicle phenomenon—and its vehicles in particular, naturally. Looking at the global picture, the company reports that its users took 26 million rides and traveled 20 million miles 2018. Other stats from the company break down its international demo. 32 percent reported traveling to and from dining and entertainment destinations. 40 percent reported traveling to and from work or school. The average age of riders is 32. One-fourth of them are 37 years old or older. Just over half have an annual income of less that $75,000/year, and 34 percent make less than $50,000 annually. 30 percent used Lime vehicles to replace a car trip (this includes taxis, car-hailing, and ridesharing as well as personal vehicles). How do Austin’s Lime riders compare? As it happens, it was one of the company’s “case study” cities. (The others were New York City/Staten Island/the Rockaways; the Los Angeles metro area; Seattle, Washington; Atlanta, Georgia; Kansas City, Missouri; Paris, France; Lisbon, Portugal; and Auckland, New Zealand). That means its Lime riders get a micro-breakdown of its stats. According to the report: 275,000 riders used Lime in Austin this year. 40% reported replacing a trip by automobile (personal car, carshare or taxi/rideshare) during their most recent trip. 38% reported commuting to/from work or school during their most recent trip. 42% reported traveling to/from dining or entertainment during their most recent trip. 12% reported traveling to/from shopping or errands during their most recent trip.",https://austin.curbed.com/2018/12/18/18146545/austin-scooters-dockless-bikes-mobility-how-many-2018

"Blindsided By Scooter Drop, Austin Races To Make Riding Safer",KUT,NPR,"Austin, TX",2019,1,7,"Blindsided By Scooter Drop, Austin Races To Make Riding Safer. Joe Cardillo was riding a Lime scooter home from work last month when it just stopped and he fell off. ""I landed on my knees and kind of fell forward and scraped up my hands,"" the 24-year-old East Austin resident said. ""Then [I] kind of rolled and then fell into the street on Riverside."" Cardillo said he slid about 5 to 10 feet across the pavement: ""It was pretty brutal."" He said he was going about 15 mph when the front wheel locked up, but he didn't feel like he needed to go to the hospital. Fortunately, Cardillo said, there weren’t any cars on the road when he fell, but he can’t help but wonder: What if there had been? ""If it happened to me, it could happen to other people,"" he said. Results from a study underway by the City of Austin and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could help reduce those chances. People generally think the CDC just deals with infectious disease outbreaks and the like, but it's not that unusual for it to do this sort of thing, said Philip Huang, medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. According to Huang, the prevalence of scooter incidents make the dockless devices a public health issue. There's currently not enough research on dockless scooters to regulate them effectively. Austin is the first city in the nation to help conduct a CDC study on them. Researchers are looking into 160 scooter-related incidents between September and November 2018. Huang said that covers some of the most accurate incident data, since hospitals in Austin started consistently tracking dockless scooter injuries then. Huang said researchers are collecting information on the circumstances, level of severity and injury, and whether people were hospitalized or had follow-up care. Findings from the study will be presented to Austin City Council around March – a little more than a year after the scooters descended on Austin. The transportation department said results will help ""refresh"" a dockless mobility ordinance that was finalized in November and help the city develop safety standards. If researchers find, for example, that texting and riding causes accidents, the city could add enforcement rules to the ordinance allowing police to issue tickets, said Jason JonMichael, the assistant director of the Austin Transportation Department. City officials asked the CDC to help conduct the study after scooter companies began entering the Austin landscape sooner than expected. The city had been in the process of launching a pilot program for dockless bikes and scooters, JonMichael said, which would have eased the vehicles onto Austin streets. Now the city is catching up. ""[Scooter companies] felt that they had the legal precedent to move forward with the launch,"" he said, so the city decided to implement the permit process. Seven dockless mobility companies own the estimated 13,370 permitted dockless devices in Austin, a majority of them scooters. Users took nearly 2.3 million rides last year. As of now, the city does not limit the number of scooters a company has in Austin as long as the company follows city regulations. Scooters are, however, limited in certain areas. Lime and Bird have the largest fleets in the city. JonMichael said the more scooters there are, the more data the CDC can collect. He said the city is working with all scooter companies to improve Austin's mobility data access. ""There [are] unique opportunities to work with these companies,"" he said, because they can share vital information for this new mode of transportation. Cardillo said he called Lime after his fall and was offered a $5 coupon. ""I literally ... just laughed, and I was just like, OK, that's not what I expected,"" he said. Lime would not make anyone available to comment. Cardillo said he's trying to play it safer now. ""I definitely know I got really confident on those things,"" he said. ""but now I'm very cautious."" But for now, he’s still doing his commute the same way just with a different company. ""I can get to work in like 10 minutes,"" he said, ""and I don't want to pay for parking and drive for 20 minutes, for sure.""",https://www.kut.org/post/blindsided-scooter-drop-austin-races-make-riding-safer

Scooter rules get more strict on UT campus,Curbed Austin,Curbed,"Austin, TX",2019,1,23," Scooter rules get more strict on UT campus. Parking penalties include fine, impoundment. While the city of Austin is taking a short break from dockless-vehicle (aka scooter) buildup, the University of Texas will begin enforcing its own regulations on the vehicles on its campus immediately, KUT reported Tuesday. Under the new university regulations, scooters improperly parked on campus will be impounded, and the relevant scooter company will be charged $150 per offense. (Scooter companies are free to pass on this charge to users, a likely—perhaps even a sure—bet.) Scooters parked on campus in a manner that blocks any sidewalk, walkway, ramp, thoroughfare, or the like will be subject to impoundment and a fine, but dockless vehicles can be parked at bicycle racks. UT will also designate 10 parking zones specifically for scooters and will consider adding more in the future. In addition to parking rules, the school is considering regulations that include an 8 mph speed limit on campus and the prohibition of faculty and staff from work-related use of the scooters. School rules currently restrict scooter use to areas where bicycle traffic is allowed, ban vehicle charging on campus, give pedestrians right-of-way, and call for the exercise of safety and caution in general. A central Austin area that includes Downtown and the UT campus saw significantly more scooter trips than any other area where they were deployed in 2018, according to a map recently created and published by KUT and based on numbers shared by the city transportation department.",https://austin.curbed.com/2019/1/23/18194645/austin-scooter-regulations-ut-parking-fine
"Scooter debate: Potential UT rules change raises liability, employee rights questions",Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2019,1,31,"Scooter debate: Potential UT rules change raises liability, employee rights questions. As electric scooters have swarmed throughout the Austin area, the University of Texas is among the local institutions grappling with how to handle the popularity and risks of the new technology. With its spring semester underway, UT has tightened its rules for student use of e-scooters on campus and is also looking to control faculty use of the vehicles. The university said it is examining whether to ban work-related use of e-scooters for UT employees, a possibility that has raised questions about employer rights in Texas and who should be liable for injuries sustained when riding an e-scooter. “There’s a misconception that these scooters are toys, but they are motorized vehicles,” said Jack Zinda, founder of Austin-based personal injury law firm Zinda Law Group. “Part of the problem is the impression of these things, which is is they are easy to use. They are not.” There are currently more than 13,000 e-scooters in use in Austin from six companies, according to city data. While e-scooters have become a popular mode of short-distance transportation, their use has also led to accidents. At top speeds of about 15 miles per hour, the e-scooters are deceptively fast. From June to November of last year, Austin-Travis County EMS responded to more than 180 calls regarding scooter-related accidents, public records show. At UT, students are only allowed to use e-scooters in areas where bikes are allowed, are required to park them in designated areas or face a $150 fine and are instructed to operate them at “low speed” in the presence of pedestrians, among other restrictions. Numerous universities throughout the country have implemented scooter-related policies, with most concentrating on traffic and parking-related issues. Some campuses, such as Arizona State University and Miami University, have banned e-scooters entirely. When it comes to UT employees, UT spokeswoman Olga Finneran said the university is examining whether to prohibit work-related trips on campus such as traveling from an office to a classroom because “they would be subject to workers compensation claims if the employee was injured.” Finneran said UT has not determined if and when it might implement the policy, nor how long it would be in place. Texas is not highly regulated when it comes to labor laws, Zinda said. The state has what’s known as “employment-at-will” measures, meaning both employers and employees can end their relationship without any reason or notice. Employers generally have wide discretion for which rules they can implement. Banning work-relates use of e-scooters, therefore, appears to be within UT’s legal right, Zinda said. While UT wouldn’t be able to force staff members to follow the rule, it could legally fire them if they were to violate it. The university might face legal trouble if it allowed only certain staff members to ride e-scooters, said local employment lawyer Colin Walsh. “If (rules) are applied discriminatorily,” Walsh said, “then it is different.” E-scooters began to roll out across America early last year, causing both disruption for city leaders who were quickly forced to regulate the devices and leading to competition between established transportation companies like Uber and e-scooter startups such as Lime and Bird. Austin limits the amount of e-scooters each company can deploy locally and also has its own set of guidelines for riding e-scooters. Companies typically allow anyone to ride the vehicles, with their terms placing the liability on customers. Lime, one of the top e-scooter companies in Austin, said it has implemented several new safety measures, such as building e-scooters with upgraded wheels, better suspension, additional braking and improved balance, and that it invested more than $3 million in educating its customers on how to properly operate the devices. “Safety of our riders and the community is our No. 1 priority,” Lime spokeswoman Juliette Coulter said in an emailed response. “Every day we’re innovating on technology, infrastructure and education to set the standard for micromobility safety.” Regardless of any rules employers put in place, however, liability will continue to be a problem, Zinda said. UT’s fines on companies that leave e-scooters improperly parked, for example, could eventually make their way down to students. But what if a company misidentifies the culprit? Those new situations are worrisome, said Zinda, who said he has received a number of calls from people injured after riding a scooter wondering where the blame should go. “Unfortunately, we can’t help people a lot of times,” Zinda said, because of the terms of service consumers must agree to before riding the scooters. “Companies are putting scooters on streets without taking on any of the risk,” he said. “I think you might see more issues pop up as more people try to copy this model.”",https://www.statesman.com/news/20190131/scooter-debate-potential-ut-rules-change-raises-liability-employee-rights-questions

A crash last week killed a 21-year-old scooter rider, the Austin Police Department says. The department says it's the first death related to a rented scooter in Austin. Police say Mark Sands was riding a Lime scooter on the wrong side of the I-35 southbound frontage road at around 1 a.m. Friday near the on-ramp at Fifth Street. An Uber driver traveling in the right lane changed lanes and hit him. Police say the driver stayed on the scene and is cooperating. Sands was taken to Dell Seton Medical Center with life-threatening injuries and was pronounced dead Saturday afternoon. Police are investigating the crash and say a toxicology report is pending. This is the fifth traffic death in Austin this year. More than 2.6 million rides have been taken on scooters in Austin since April, according to Austin Transportation Department data. The scooters came to the city last year without approval from the Austin Transportation Department. Bird initially rolled out its fleet, followed by Lime and other providers shortly after. The city then fast-tracked a pilot program to keep them operating in Austin, which was approved by City Council in April. Now, the Austin Transportation Department says there are nine scooter operators in the city and more than 15,000 scooters. The City Council is still considering tweaks before a final vote on the rules, which is expected this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also conducting a first-of-its-kind study on the impact of the scooters here.

Whether you love them or hate them, dockless scooters have taken over the city, but there are things planned in 2019 the city is doing to keep things under control. 2018 could be known as the year dockless scooters took the Austin streets by storm, and many people see them as a very fun and easy way to get around. The new fun and easy way to get around has also proven to have risks. Early this month, a rider was hit and killed by a car near I-35 in downtown Austin. Another issue is that some scooters are ending up where they shouldn't be like Austin's lakes and creeks. ""It's like a recipe for disaster,"" said Tracia McDougal, who thinks the scooters are dangerous. The danger isn't stopping people from hopping on. ""They're just fun and convenient,"" said Lauren Siegert, who loves riding the scooters. When we take a look at the numbers since dockless scooters made their debut in Austin in 2018: - There are 9 licensed scooter companies in Austin. There are 15,300 licensed dockless scooters in the city. In October of 2018, the city of Austin said there were 341,000 rides, more than any other month. McDougal tells KVUE, ""there needs to be more guidelines and rules around it."" That's why the city is stepping in. Last month, the Austin Transportation department hit the brakes on issuing new licenses to dockless mobility companies. The CDC is working with the City on a study for how to prevent accidents. Austinites are still split on how they feel about it all. ""I think they look like a lot of fun.

Scooters pulled out of Lady Bird Lake covered in zebra mussels,CBS Austin,CBS,"Austin, TX",2019,2,14,"Scooters pulled out of Lady Bird Lake covered in zebra mussels. A dozen or more electric scooters were found submerged in Lady Bird Lake. It's one of the biggest scooter dumps in the Austin area and it has the potential to be an environmental hazard. ""We want to get them pulled out as quick as possible,"" said Patrick Kelly, environmental compliance specialist with the City of Austin Watershed Protection Department. Daniel Saltus found a Lime scooter on Thursday in Lady Bird Lake under the Redbud Trail Bridge. ""I'm just trying to fish them out,"" said Saltus. His hook is on a long pole that he maneuvers from a kayak. It's not easy, but he says he won't just leave them here. ""I saw on Facebook a kayaker that saw a bunch of scooters in the water and I wanted to get them out of the water,"" said Saltus. The video was taken by two Austin anglers, Matt Mellor and Teddy Hall. They were fishing when they discovered the scooters. It's hard to see all the scooters in the video, but the whitish lines that are easy to spot are electric scooters that were dumped in the lake. ""I'm just really worried about the water supply. These scooters have lithium batteries and I don't want to see those leach into the environment,"" said Saltus. ""If there's battery acid leaking it's going to be harmful,"" said Kelly. Kelly responds to complaints from the City of Austin's Pollution Hotline. Anyone who finds an abandoned or dumped electric scooter should call 512-974-2550 and report it. The hotline is open 24/7. Leaking batteries are one concern, but the city says scooters are also a water hazard and could block drainage. ""We go and identify which company it belongs to and then we issue a notice of violation to that company to come and recover the scooter,"" said Kelly. Saltus works as a Lime juicer who picks up and charges electric scooters. He says he's juiced about 2,000 scooters, but this is the first one he's hauled out of the water. ""It's got zebra mussels all over it,"" said Saltus. ""This isn't about the money. This is about keeping our water supply clean."" It's hard to tell how long this scooter has been submerged in Lady Bird Lake, but zebra mussels are already attached to the wheels. Both are an unwelcome infestation that is growing. ""Help would be great. There's a lot of ground to cover,"" said Saltus. Most of the scooters dumped in Lady Bird Lake near Redbud Trail Bridge are from Lime. The company uses contract employees called juicers to retrieve scooters, but also has an operations team that will be investigating the site and making sure the scooters don't become long-term residents like the zebra mussels.",https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/scooters-pulled-out-of-lady-bird-lake-covered-in-zebra-mussels
"More than 1,000 scooters left on UT campus have been relocated",KVUE,ABC,"Austin, TX",2019,2,20,"More than 1,000 scooters left on UT campus have been relocated. The University of Texas at Austin's Parking and Transportation Services has implemented new parking rules for the scooters left haphazardly across campus. The University of Texas at Austin's Parking and Transportation Services has relocated more than 1,000 scooters, and impounded almost 700, since Jan. 22.   If the scooters were relocated, this means they were left near a parking area but needed proper placement.   In an email UT Austin sent students, they detailed that they will start impounding scooters that are improperly parked along campus malls and those that are ""blocking sidewalks, impeding pedestrian accessibility or strewn in courtyards, doorways and stairwells."" The email also said the charge to companies for impounded scooters is $150, and, ""as a result, scooter companies may pass these fees along to responsible riders.""   UT Austin eased into impounding scooters in order to give riders time to learn and follow the parking rules. Currently, UT is relocating more scooters than they are impounding.   Behavior has started to change with scooter ridership. UT Parking and Transportation Services has noticed the impounds, and the number of scooters needing relocation, is steadily decreasing because scooter users are actively trying to comply with the new rules by parking at campus bike racks and the new scooter parking zones, rather than in the middle of sidewalks, lawns, buildings and other areas.    UT does not fine for relocating scooters. However, UT fines the scooter companies up to $150 for scooters that are impounded.

Austin braces for impact of scooters and spring break on SXSW,CBS Austin,CBS,"Austin, TX",2019,2,27,"Austin braces for impact of scooters and spring break on SXSW. Austin is about to find out how well scooters and South by Southwest (SXSW) mix. This is the first year electric scooters will be one of the transportation options during the 10-day festival. Another unknown in 2019 is the impact of SXSW and spring break not being aligned on the March calendar. The Austin Independent School District, University of Texas and Texas State University will dismiss for spring break the week after the festival. That means more cars, bicycles and scooters will be competing for space on streets that will already be crowded with tens of thousands of SXSW badge holders. “We're going to ask people to be patient,” said Austin Police Chief Brian Manley. Chief Manley knows that patience will be tested with Austin area students and families not able to leave the city for spring break during SXSW. To keep pedestrians safe, barricades will be going up on several heavily traveled streets in the downtown area. “We will have a marked police car at every barricade with officers present,” said Chief Manley. The Spring Fest ATX Mobility Guide lays out how Austin will deal with what may be larger than normal SXSW crowds. The streets in red, which include chunks of East 6th, Red River and Rainey streets, will become pedestrian only zones with no scooters allowed. “You're going to have to dismount and walk that bicycle through that area. If you're on a scooter you're going to have to leave that scooter outside that area. If you're on a skateboard you're going to have to pick up your skateboard quite honestly and walk with it. And that's strictly for safety,” said Robert Spillar, Director of the Austin Transportation Department. Anyone caught violating the pedestrian zones rules will face up to a $500 fine. “We will enforce all traffic laws on motor vehicles but also on those that are using bicycles and e-scooters or other modes of transportation,” said Chief Manley. Another concern is that scooters may be dumped near the entrances to pedestrian zones. That would make it difficult for first responders to get past the barricades in an emergency. Police plan to redirect riders to use preferred scooter parking areas scattered around downtown. Lime says it will reinforce those efforts. “We will make sure we have folks there near the barricades in order to take those additional units out to preferred parking area,” said Joe Deshotel with Lime. Lime also plans to offer financial incentives to riders who use preferred parking areas.

Are scooters the big winners at this year’s SXSW?,Curbed Austin,Curbed,"Austin, TX",2019,3,14,"Are scooters the big winners at this year’s SXSW? Dockless apps get festival spike. s anyone who has been in or around Downtown Austin in the past week can attest, dockless mobility was kind of a thing at SXSW this year. While dockless, electric bicycles were in the mix, it’s the scooters, of course, that draw the most ranting and raving. Sure, Austinites have had plenty of time to weigh in on the scooterization of local transportation, since we’ve had the things around—mostly in Downtown, South Austin, and Central East neighborhoods—for almost a year. And we all know how dicey navigating those areas gets during every SXSW, something to be expected when you invite 400,000 people to visit the already crowded streets of your central city for 10 days. Some conventioneers and festival attendees, however, had strong reactions on both ends of the spectrum. And while it wasn’t exactly the Death Race 2000 situation The Verge’s Nick Statt described in his take on the “scooter invasion,” the influx and concentration of the vehicles (along with hordes of people willing to ride them) made the public parts of SXSW a little more intense this year. The clear winners in the SXSW scooter derbies, at least from early indicators, are the companies that deploy them. According to a report by mobile-data cruncher Apptopia, the top national dockless-mobility apps—which also happen to be the ones with the most vehicles in Austin at the moment—got significant bumps in downloads last week, especially during the beginning of the conference and festivals. According to Apptopia’s report (which its website notes could have up to a 20 percent error rate but is more about the trend than hard numbers—as well as measuring a phenomenon that was at least anecdotally visible to those on the ground), Lime saw the biggest leap in downloads for the period. Bird had the second-highest increase, although one more than 10 percent lower than Lime’s. All four companies in the report showed sharp increases and peaks in downloads during the first three days of SXSW, which started on March 8 this year.",https://austin.curbed.com/2019/3/14/18264531/austin-sxsw-scooters-dockless
Here’s how many scooters (and e-bikes) were actually at SXSW,Curbed Austin,Curbed,"Austin, TX",2019,3,22,"Here’s how many scooters (and e-bikes) were actually at SXSW. Quite a few, as it turns out. Most Austinites have seen the Instagram post by now: A mound of scooters, let’s say eight feet tall, smack in the middle of both Dirty Sixth and SXSW. Snapped by Instagrammer Trent Jones (@mooseheadfeed) and said to be created by members of the police department one heady night during the festivals, the pile served as a symbol for pretty much whatever you wanted it to be: cautionary tale, possible arson magnet, or source of passing amusement.  Mostly, though, the buzz was around the (pick one): 1) abundance, 2) inevitability, 3) happy synergy, or 4) plague of dockless vehicles—primarily electric scooters—created at SXSW this year. While dockless bikes and scooters have been operating in the central city for just shy of a year now, their deployment and popularity for 10 days in March—along with a lack of clear city regulations—prompted a wide-ranging and vigorous conversation about everything from the nature of the people riding them to apocalyptic visions for the future of transportation. In the end, though, were there really that many, and was it really that significant? Yes and yes, as it turns out. Major apps for dockless vehicles saw a big increase in downloads during the festival and, according to data on the city’s dockless mobility website (boiled down nicely in a Monday KUT story), the number of trips on dockless vehicles during the festival totaled at least 465,785—434,000 of them being scooter rides, or more than 12 percent of the total 3.5 million scooter rides taken since the vehicles were (legally) deployed here almost a year ago. While the city suspended granting new dockless-vehicle licenses shortly before SXSW 2019, according to a January KUT report, there were already 17,650 scooters and bikes on the street at that point—all licensed to operate only in the “downtown Austin project coordination zone”—precisely the areas where the conference takes place and festivals (interactive, film, and music) and ancillary activities are heaviest. Between setting up designated scooter and bike parking areas and rounding up, charging, and returning them to the streets, dockless companies were active in doing what they could to ensure the vehicles remained concentrated downtown during the conference and festivals. Let’s go to the numbers  Here are some other fun numbers from the event, using city data compiled by KUT for Monday’s story. When considering them, it’s important to keep in mind that city data do not include trips of less than one-tenth of a mile, or about 528 feet—a little over a block in Austin, more or less. Let’s not discount the dockless bikes, either: Nearly 32,000 people rode them during the fest—23 percent of the rides the city has tracked since April. They traveled a median distance of 1.09 miles, and rides lasted a median of 10.6 minutes. The highest number of bike rides during a single day of the festival was 4,341, on March 14.  The 433,942 rides taken on dockless scooters were for a median distance of 0.65 miles and lasted a median of 7.8 minutes. There were 52,254 scooter rides on March 9, the highest number of individual scooter rides in a single day during the festival. Austin and scooter safety  Last December, the national Center for Disease control opened its first study of dockless scooter safety in Austin. The center has finished collecting data for the study but has not yet released its findings.  There has been one death caused by a crash between a car and a scooter in the city.  An Austin man is suing the Lime scooter company, claiming that a malfunction that occurred when he was using the scooter endangered him, according to a February KXAN-NBC report. What’s next for dockless mobility in Austin  During and before SXSW, dockless-vehicle rides were allowed to operate under a set of guidelines posted on its website:      Pedestrians First - Yield to people walking on sidewalks.      Park Responsibly - Park in a secure, upright position in designated areas, such as furniture zones of sidewalks, public bike racks and other marked parking zones. On sidewalks, give at least 3 feet of clearance for accessibility.      Stay on Right of Way - Do not take dockless devices to unauthorized areas, such as private property, parkland, or state-owned land, unless otherwise authorized.      Know What You’re Sharing - Users have access to dockless mobility services without having to share Personally Identifiable Information and can opt in to data sharing only after getting clear information about what data will be shared.      Right and Report - If you see a unit toppled over or parked improperly, help out by righting the unit and reporting the issue to Austin 3-1-1.  The University of Texas, meanwhile, has already set and is enforcing rules for the scooters and bikes on its Austin campus.

The University of Texas’s Scooter Speed Limit Is a Glimpse of the Future,Texas Monthly,,"Austin, TX",2019,3,26,"The University of Texas’s Scooter Speed Limit Is a Glimpse of the Future. On Monday, the University of Texas at Austin announced a new speed limit for the dockless scooters that have become ubiquitous not just on its campus but throughout central Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio, as well as at other colleges like Texas Tech and Abilene Christian. Unlike conventional speed limits, it won’t take a cop with a radar gun to ensure riders don’t break the rule. Instead, the 8-mph limit will be enforced using geofencing technology, which will throttle down a scooter’s top speed (typically 15 to 17 mph) whenever it’s on the UT campus. The limit, which goes into effect March 26, appears to be the first implementation of geofencing to regulate scooter speed anywhere in the country. (San Diego approved similar limits earlier this month, but those don’t go into effect until June.) Cities and other institutions—mostly universities—are still trying to figure out the right way to manage these vehicles when they get dropped off within their territories, often without much in the way of a discussion of the rules. When the Austin City Council approved scooter regulations last May, it included a requirement that the devices be equipped with geofencing technology to alert users when they parked in an off-limits area. In Denver, that same technology was implemented last year. But using geofencing to cap speed is a new frontier that we’re likely to see much more of—for scooters, driverless cars, and other modes of personal transportation. Earlier this month, Volvo announced all its new vehicles would be limited to 112 mph—along with a plan to test geofencing that could automatically slow cars as they drive near schools and hospitals. Technology like this still requires more testing. Problems must be solved regarding how hard cars would brake, for example, when they enter geofenced zones and whether that could present safety risks to cars traveling behind them. Los Angeles stopped considering a form of geofencing that would disable scooters when they enter scooter-free zones after the city realized that it couldn’t answer questions about what might happen if the motors shut off in the midst of traffic or while traveling down hills. Still, those challenges likely can, and probably will, be solved.

The Texas Senate Committee on Transportation took input and testimony Wednesday on a bill which aims to regulate the electric scooters which have emerged in Texas cities over the past few years. This bill would set a speed limit for these scooters at 15 miles per hour and would ban two people from riding together on one scooter, among other things. The electric scooters that have been on the market in Austin can travel as fast as 20 miles per hour, depending on the brand. Senate Bill 549 introduced by State Senator Royce West ( D- Dallas). It aims to set a baseline for scooter regulations and allow local entities to choose stricter rules. “There has been little guidance on whether scooters can be ridden on sidewalks or with pedestrians,” West told the committee. As it’s currently written the bill would establish a minimum age of 16 for riders and require them to have a valid drivers license, however West acknowledged that there’s been pushback on the driver license requirement and that they will likely amend that portion of the bill. A committee substitution that would likely have amendments should be ready sometime next week, West’s office said. “We’re looking at safety on this, there are some safety concerns with the persons riding the scooters, they are not toys and there are some people who treat them like they are toys,” said a spokesperson for Senator West. West’s office opposes having scooters on the sidewalk because they think it’s dangerous. The spokesperson explained that the bill would restrict scooter access on sidewalks, though it would not be a ban on having scooters on sidewalks. KXAN asked whether that would mean Austinites could ride scooters on their sidewalks. “Depends on where you’re riding,” the spokesperson said, explaining that some cities may want to tailor the restrictions on scooters depending on how dense or urban their community is. The bill would also give TxDOT and local transportation entities more ability to regulate. It would ban people from “double riding” or carrying other riders. It could give the department the authority to ban the operation of scooters on highways. The bill states that people can only operate scooters on: Paths set aside exclusively for bikes or pedestrians On roadways with bike lanes In certain cases where a roadway does not have a bike lane Under this bill, scooter riders will be allowed to ride in a roadway without a bicycle lane if the roadway has a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less and the person rides as close as possible to the edge of the curb. It would also require riders to yield to pedestrians. Additionally, the bill bars people from parking scooters in a way that blocks a roadway or sidewalk. It would allow cities to add regulations if they see fit, including regulating the speed of scooters, restricting where they can travel, imposing higher criminal or civil penalties or requiring riders to wear a helmet. Austin sit-down scooter company Ojo came to testify in support of the bill, though the company asked that the speed limit is raised to 20 miles per hour for sit-down scooters. West’s office assured KXAN that there will be a speed limit in this bill, though there’s a chance the current 15 mph speed limit may be amended. California-based Ojo debuted in Austin in January, in partnership with Austin Commuter Scooter LLC., a subsidiary of Bike Share Austin, the operator of Austin B Cycle. ACS oversees the deployment of this fleet of scooters. “The scooters belong on roads, on bike lanes, and not on sidewalks,” the Ojo representative said. He explained that Ojo has 100 scooters in the U.S. and all of those are currently in Austin. Disability Rights Texas came to testify on the bill. Though the advocacy organization did not take a position, a representative asked that in the process to regulate scooters that people with disabilities be considered. “People with vision impairments have tripped over them,” she explained. “People with mobility impairments have been blocked from going where they needed to go.” West urged the committee to consider the increasing number of reports they’ve been hearing about regarding scooter injuries. He noted that in Dallas there were 450,000 scooter rides between July 1 and September 20 in 2018. He added that in Austin during the ten-day period of South by Southwest, there were 434,000 dockless rides. “We need to get ahead of the curve,” West said. Committee chair State Senator Robert Nichols (R-Jacksonville) noted that city’s in Texas are having a hard time keeping up with ordinances to regulate scooters. He suggested adding language to the bill prohibiting riding scooters on state-maintained highways. If passed, this bill would go into effect September 1, 2019. Regulations in the city of Austin This bill comes just as the city of Austin is grappling with how to regulate scooters on its own. The city is working on more long-term regulations for scooters (as opposed to the ones the city is operating under now which were crafted a year ago when scooters were brand new to Austin). Council opted to postpone a vote on these new scooter-related regulations until May 23, one of which would give Austin Police more authority to cite riders who are traveling dangerously. While the city of Austin has not set speed limits, they are considering something called “slow zones,” explained a spokesperson with the Austin Transportation Department. These slow zones would be in areas where there are known to be lots of people walking, the city is looking at requiring scooters to travel slower in these zones. Look here to see the latest on Austin’s discussion about scooter regulations and a list of what some of the proposed scooter regulations in the city would include. Austin Leaders will also be discussing the proposed scooter regulations for the city at the Mobility Committee Meeting at 1 p.m. on Thursday.",https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/texas-bill-could-create-15-mph-speed-limit-for-scooters/

In less than a year of operation, dockless electric scooters have generated $723,090 in permit application fees for the city of Austin. That's according to a recent report from the Austin American-Statesman, which obtained Transportation Department documents outlining the revenue generated between May 17, 2018, and March 29. The city has raked in more than $750,000 once fines levied against impounded scooters are considered. From April 1, 2018, until March 15, $33,590 in impound fees were collected by the city. Those funds have been funneled into a city fund that ""pays for sidewalk fixes and cleanup, engineering work, downtown initiatives and parking enforcement,"" according to the Statesman. The funds are derived from a $30 permit application fee that dockless scooter operators are obligated to pay for each device. Ten companies have been licensed to operate more than 15,000 scooters in Austin, but only seven companies — Bird, Jump, Lime, Lyft, OjO, Spin and VeoRide — have already deployed devices. The $30 fee, which the Statesman reported is paid every six months, is also paid when a company applies to increase the size of its fleet. For now, the city's Transportation Department has paused the issuance of scooter permits as the Austin City Council considers new legislation to empower police officers to ticket dangerous riders.",https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2019/04/22/report-city-has-generated-723-000-in-scooter.html
"Nearly 200 people injured in scooter crashes in 3 months, health officials say",Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2019,5,1,"Nearly 200 people injured in scooter crashes in 3 months, health officials say. A new report from Austin Public Health examining electric scooter-related injuries showed that nearly 200 people were hurt while using the devices in the city from September through November.  Health officials identified 160 confirmed cases of injuries related to electric scooters and 32 others in which scooters were the likely cause. Combined, those cases resulted in 190 injuries to riders, one to a pedestrian and one to a cyclist over the three-month period of the study.  Austin Public Health started working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track injuries to riders shortly after the scooters arrived in town in April 2018.  “Concurrently with the appearance, doctors at local hospitals and the local emergency medical services began observing injuries associated with this emerging mode of transportation,” the study said. Of the 190 riders who were injured during the study’s three-month time frame, 48% had injuries like fractures, cuts and abrasions to the head, according to the report. Additionally, 70% of riders had injuries to the wrists, hands, arms or shoulders, and 55% had injuries to the legs, knees, ankles or feet.  More than a third of those injured broke a bone, and a total of six people had fractures involving the head.  Texas Senate approves limits on e-scooters  Health officials found that 80 people had injuries that were characterized as “serious.”  More than half of the crashes happened on the street, and a third of them happened on sidewalks. Other locations included parking lots, garages and pathways where no motor vehicles are allowed.  Nearly a third of the crashes happened in the downtown area, and on average, about two crashes happened each day through the course of the study.  “A key finding is a third of the interviewed riders were injured during their first e-scooter ride,” the study said. “Overall, 63% of the injured riders had ridden an e-scooter nine times or fewer before injury. While most (60%) of the riders in this study received training on using the e-scooter via a phone application, additional training may be necessary.”  The study’s authors urged city leaders to establish and strengthen tracking of scooter-related injuries, and to increase educational messaging about safe scooting.  City officials will hold a news conference Thursday at 10 a.m. at City Hall to discuss results of the study.",https://www.statesman.com/news/20190501/nearly-200-people-injured-in-scooter-crashes-in-3-months-health-officials-say
"Her scooter brakes sent her to the ER, she says — now she’s suing Lime",Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2019,5,8,"Her scooter brakes sent her to the ER, she says — now she’s suing Lime. Dorothy Walker tried to stop her Lime rental electric scooter during a ride in downtown Austin last summer, but something was wrong with the brakes, she alleges in a lawsuit filed last week against Lime.  The scooter then tipped over, sending Walker into an iron gate surrounding the Capitol grounds, the suit says, and leaving her with multiple facial fractures, a damaged tear duct, two broken ribs and her nose “nearly severed from her face.”  Walker is now at least the second person in Austin to sue Lime, one of a handful of companies behind dockless scooters in Austin, for a faulty brake issue. In February, 38-year-old Austin Community College student Jeremiah Mahoney similarly sued Lime after he flew off one of its scooters when the wheels locked.  Walker’s suit, filed May 2, claims that Lime knew its scooters had issues that caused “sudden excessive braking.” Austin-based attorney Jack Zinda said it is unclear what exactly happened in Walker’s crash, because he and Walker have not been able to download data from the scooter she was riding.  “We’re trying to figure that out still. Essentially, the brakes did not work as they should have worked. Her belief is that the brakes malfunctioned,” Zinda said. He said Walker is one of seven people Zinda Law Group is representing in scooter-related injury cases against multiple scooter companies. A February statement from Lime said it had detected a glitch causing the front wheels of its scooters to brake, especially when the devices moved downhill at a high speed while hitting an obstacle like a pothole. The scooter could stop unexpectedly, the statement said. Several people were injured by Lime scooters suddenly locking up in New Zealand, and that country’s head of Transportation threatened in February to remove all the devices from the roads there, the Guardian newspaper reported.  A Lime spokesperson said the glitch has since been fixed and the company has not seen any more such issues.  “Lime continues to closely monitor the issue to ensure there are no additional causes of the malfunction and the issue remains categorically resolved,” a Lime spokesperson said Tuesday. Its representatives said the safety of Lime’s riders is the company’s highest priority.  When Walker crashed Aug. 14, she was going to meet some friends after getting off work early, Zinda said. It was about 4 p.m., and she was riding a scooter for the first time, the lawsuit says. Walker was riding west on 11th Street, near the intersection with Congress Avenue, on the north sidewalk next to the Capitol, the lawsuit says.  Walker was in a hospital for three days after the crash and had to have emergency reconstructive surgery. She will need more reconstructive plastic surgery, the lawsuit says.  “She was catastrophically injured,” Zinda said.  Walker is seeking more than $1 million in damages for her medical treatment, pain and suffering, physical disfigurement, mental anguish, loss of earning capacity and lost wages, the lawsuit says.  Walker’s injuries are among dozens recorded in Austin since scooters first began cropping up in April 2018. Austin health officials, in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just wrapped up a study of scooter-related injuries reported over a three-month period and found that most were preventable.  The emergency room at Dell Seton Medical Center downtown has seen one to two scooter injuries every day since scooters arrived, and at least 97 people since May 2018 have been hospitalized with more severe injuries, said Dr. Christopher Ziebell, the hospital’s emergency department medical director.  Other lawsuits have popped up in Austin about scooters. Mark Walters said he tripped over a Bird scooter that was lying on a sidewalk in November, and Michael Fuchs filed a petition in small claims court in August for $3,000 after he said a Lime scooter sideswiped his vehicle.

New Study Shows How Scooters Can Hurt,Austin Chronicle,Association of Alternative Newsmedia,"Austin, TX",2019,5,10," New Study Shows How Scooters Can Hurt. City works with CDC to analyze injuries to riders; Lege weighs in. A study commissioned by Austin Public Health in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control found that about 20 scooter riders were injured for every 100,000 trips taken during a three-month period last fall in Downtown Austin. By looking at Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services incident reports and hospital emergency department records, along with interviewing riders, the study identified 190 incidents in which a rider was injured – plus two in which a nonrider was injured – in an accident involving a dockless electric scooter. Researchers were able to interview 125 of these riders, helping to inform the study on how the riders were using the scooters, where they were riding, and other factors that may have contributed to their injury. According to APH, the study was the first in the nation to include such interviews. Nearly half (48%) of injured riders sustained a fracture, laceration, or abrasion to the head, with 15% of those riders showing symptoms ""suggestive of a traumatic brain injury."" (Only one of the interviewed riders was wearing a helmet.) About half of the injured riders were between the ages of 18-29, and about two-thirds had taken fewer than 10 scooter trips before their injury. About 60% of interviewed riders said they ""received training on using the e-scooter"" via a phone app, which could indicate that the brief training offered by scooter companies is not enough to prevent most injuries. At a press conference on May 2, Austin Transportation Director Robert Spillar said some of the injuries could be attributed to users adjusting to a new mode of transportation. ""As a community, we're learning how to use them,"" he said. ""When you first rode a bicycle, you probably fell off the first time. ... We continue to see better behavior as we go along."" The study also refutes the anecdotal evidence offered by anyone who's walked Downtown since scooters hit the streets last year and claimed a near-death experience: Only one of the 190 injured riders collided with a pedestrian, while one other collided with a cyclist. The study also found that cars and scooters seem to coexist on Austin's roads fairly comfortably: Just 10% of injuries were caused by colliding with a motor vehicle. Notably, the APH report also provided evidence that scooters aren't going anywhere. During the Sept. 5-Nov. 30 study period, 936,110 e-scooter trips were recorded, for a total of 891,121 miles of use. With other cities across the state also seeing rapid growth in scooter use, enter the Texas Legis­lat­ure. On May 1, the Senate passed a bill that would impose new regulations on scooter usage statewide. Introduced by Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, Senate Bill 549 would mostly regulate scooter operation and parking. ""We are beginning to see more and more accidents that are occurring on the electrical scooters,"" West said of his legislation. The law would prevent Texans under the age of 16 from using dockless rental scooters; speed would be constrained to 15 mph for standing scooters and 20 mph for sitting scooters. Only one user would be permitted to ride a scooter at a time, and riders must yield to pedestrians. Users would also be prevented from parking scooters in a way that blocks sidewalks, roads, or paths for people with disabilities. Most controversially, the bill was amended on the floor to remove a provision banning scooters from sidewalks, instead leaving that up to cities, which could also impose stricter regulations on scooters if desired. (The rules in SB 549 largely mirror Austin's current ordinance, though City Council is set to consider enforcement measures and penalties this month.) After about 30 minutes of debate, the bill passed 20-11 and now moves to the House.",https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2019-05-10/new-study-shows-how-scooters-can-hurt/
Austin Now Has Rules For Dockless Scooter Riders,KUT,NPR,"Austin, TX",2019,5,23,"Austin Now Has Rules For Dockless Scooter Riders. The City of Austin has firmed up rules of the road for people riding rentable, dockless e-scooters. The city council unanimously approved the rules Thursday. The new rules formally fold scooters into the city’s transportation code and regulate them in a way similar to bikes. That means riders must abide by the city’s hands-free cell phone ordinance and operate a scooter in a ""reasonable and prudent manner,"" meaning someone could be cited for riding recklessly on a sidewalk. It also bans multiple riders on a single device and requires operators to not block sidewalks or building entrances when they park. Robin Stallings of Bike Texas told councilmembers after the vote that he supports the ordinance, but said its helmet requirement for riders under 18 could be tricky to enforce. ""There’s better ways to get helmets on heads. But I don’t really see 17-year-olds or 16-year-olds or any other age walking around with a helmet in their hand for the once or twice a week when they might take the opportunity and jump on a micro mobility device,"" Stallings said. The ordinance does not explicitly ban users from taking scooters into city parks, as the city is in the middle of a pilot program that allows them to operate on a handful of trails. The city will reevaluate how to regulate parkland use after that program is done. Council Member Ann Kitchen expressed concern with how well the ordinance could be enforced, and suggested directing City Manager Spencer Cronk to report back to the council about enforcement sometime in the future. ""The reason for that is that one of the biggest concerns that the community has is that the requirements we put in place actually work in terms of being enforced and certain kinds of behavior no longer continuing,""  Kitchen said. Since arriving in Austin roughly a year ago, the scooters have been divisive. Some say the hastily parked scooters obstruct sidewalks and that the low bar for ridership poses safety risks. Proponents argue they give tourists and commuters alike a cheap, efficient way of getting over what transit advocates call the last-mile problem, reducing the number of cars on the road. Currently there are 10 providers renting out the more than 14,000 scooters, and nearly 5 million rides have been taken, according to Austin Transportation Department data. Violation of the new ordinance is a class C misdemeanor – with a fine of $20 for a first offense and $40 for any subsequent ticket. A previous iteration of the proposed rules from March would've banned riders from using scooters on some sidewalks, but the ordinance before Council today stopped short of that.",https://www.kut.org/post/austin-now-has-rules-dockless-scooter-riders
"Council Gives Green Light to Convention Center, Scooter Riders",Austin Chronicle,Association of Alternative Newsmedia,"Austin, TX",2019,5,24,"Council Gives Green Light to Convention Center, Scooter Riders. May 23 meeting tackles ""Downtown puzzle,"" ""micro-mobility"". This is what happens to scooters that don't follow the rules. City Council wrapped up what Mayor Steve Adler called a “pretty hard and big May” yesterday (May 23) with unanimous votes on the major items of the day: a plan to expand the Convention Center while preserving nearby Palm School, and new regulations on “micro-mobility devices” – such as electric scooters. Those votes followed a lengthy executive session and Council working up a bevy of amendments to Council Member Kathie Tovo’s already lengthy resolution regarding the southeast quadrant of downtown, home to the Convention Center and other projects. These included asking CIty Manager Spencer Cronk to include service providers for those experiencing homelessness to the list of stakeholders crafting the plan (Tovo), and setting a deadline of Aug. 1 for plan delivery, in time for the fiscal 2020 budget (CM Ann Kitchen).  An amendment from CM Greg Casar directed staff to analyze funding for potential infrastructure projects in the Rainey Street district that would support Convention Center expansion, and which parts of the city (such as Casar’s north-central District 4) would lose out on those funds for their own projects. Another Casar amendment ask for recommendations to “create more formalized representation of the interests of employees” at the Convention Center and its adjoining hotel (now a Hilton), which is owned by the city.  Toward the end of the discussion, CM Natasha Harper-Madison highlighted the potential of the Convention Center reboot, along with work on Palm School, Rainey Street, Waller Creek, and the new Downtown MetroRail station, to “reconnect the downtown grid.” This latest iteration of Adler’s ”Downtown puzzle” is also crafted to provide additional revenues – through a tourism-based public improvement district a la the Downtown Austin Alliance – that could support the arts and city homeless initiatives.  Later in the afternoon, Council jumped around among three draft ordinances to regulate micro-mobility, which mostly means our ubiquitous dockless electric scooters, but also includes dockless bikes, e-bikes, and future technological developments in the space. One of these ordinances, finalizing the actual rules of riding, was adopted unanimously and establishes that riders are able to use sidewalks anywhere in town, without the “dismount zones” included in previous proposals (and enforced, at least in theory, during South by Southwest).  Additional rules include: a ban on using electronic devices while riding (hands-free use is ok); penalties for parents who allow children to ride without helmets; prohibition on more than one rider at a time; and requirements that scooters not be parked in the public right of way. Violations of the rules will be Class C misdemeanors with a $20 fine on the first infraction, $40 thereafter.  Also gone from previous iterations of the rules are speed limits (which the Texas Legislature also considered this session). Instead, riders should scoot in a “reasonable and prudent manner.” That ambiguous phrase caused some concern on the dais, as it leaves discretion to individual police officers as to whether a rider is being reckless enough to warrant a citation. To help promote the new rules, Kitchen called for an educational effort, similar to the city’s recent “Don’t Block the Box” campaign, and for issuing warnings rather than citations to first-time offenders.  Another sticking point on the dais involved rules, or the lack of them, for scooter usage in parks and on trails. A Parks and Recreation Department pilot project allows scooters on some trails and is expected to wrap up in September, with PARD moving forward with proposed rules thereafter. At the meeting, CM Leslie Pool asked Cronk to explore the use of geofencing to limit scooter use in parks, as has been done on the UT campus. Pool also asked Cronk to analyze the feasibility of requiring scooter operators to include “unique identifiers” on each device, which could make it easier for law enforcement – or just regular citizens – to call out riders using the devices dangerously.  The other two scooter ordinances, governing the city’s relationship with micro-mobility providers (e.g., Bird, Lime), were postponed unanimously (with CM Alison Alter off the dais. Those items would have instituted a franchise model akin to that used currently with taxi companies, which CM Jimmy Flannigan feared could stifle innovation (as the providers claim).  A potential problem, Flannigan pointed out, was that if Council had to approve all new micro-mobility operators (as they do now with taxis; scooters et al. get permits directly from the Austin Transportation Department), existing companies in the market could “wage political campaigns” to sway Council votes. Why would we think transportation “disruptors” would do a thing like that? It’s not clear what the city would do instead, but ATD and city legal staff get to figure it out before an Aug. 8 deadline.",https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2019-05-24/council-gives-green-light-to-convention-center-scooter-riders/
Austin just OK’d new rules for scooters. Do you know what they are?,Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2019,5,31,"Austin just OK’d new rules for scooters. Do you know what they are? Scooters just about sent Austin into a frenzy with their arrival last year, and for months, the stand-up electric devices had most asking: What the heck do we do with these things? It took more than a year, but Austin City Council members answered that question last week with a new set of scooter rules in which violators could face a Class C misdemeanor charge punishable by $20 or $40 fines. The City Council passed an ordinance last week that outlines rules for scooter riders. It adds dockless or “micro-mobility” devices to the city’s code where scooters previously fell under the same rules as bicycles. Austin police officers and parking enforcement officers with the city’s Transportation Department can charge scooter riders who break the slew of new rules. The first offense is punishable by a $20 fine and a $40 fine on the second, according to the draft of the ordinance that City Council members reviewed at a May 23 meeting. A final ordinance will be posted in the next week or two, transportation officials said, but some of the basics of the new rules include: Obey traffic signals and signs. Yield to pedestrians on sidewalks and in crosswalks and yield to vehicles when leaving an alley, driveway or building. Riders younger than 18 must wear a helmet. You cannot ride two at a time on any of the more than 16,000 devices floating around the city. Scooter riders using trails that are part of the Parks and Recreation Department’s pilot program also should follow the rider rules laid out in the ordinance. Another big rule revolves around texting and scooting: You can’t do it. You can’t call and scoot, either. Get off your phone, music player, laptop, pager, GPS, gaming or reading device while using a scooter. Scooter riders now have to stop and give people their name, address and phone number if they injure them or damage their property while on a scooter. If scooter riders damage unattended property, they have to leave a written note with their information, the ordinance says. Scooters are now allowed on all downtown sidewalks. How can I ride? First things first, according to the ordinance: You must ride in a “reasonable and prudent manner” on sidewalks. Don’t ride on public landscaping, furniture, utilities, architectural features, art or in between vehicles. When using a bicycle lane, do not go in the opposite direction as traffic, unless the lane designates you to do so. Riders on sidewalks must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which means they cannot hinder the movement of people with limited mobility, the ordinance says. What about parking? Scooters cannot obstruct bus stops, accessibility ramps, commercial use zones, valet areas, shelters, passenger loading or customer service zones, among others. They cannot be left parked in or on railroad or light rail tracks, in vehicle parking spots, between vehicle parking spots or on private property without the owner’s permission. They cannot be parked in building entryways, exits or driveways. Scooters cannot obstruct benches or parking pay stations. Scooters can be parked in spaces that are designated for them.",https://www.statesman.com/news/20190531/austin-just-okd-new-rules-for-scooters-do-you-know-what-they-are
City Council to Continue Considering Scooters in August,Austin Chronicle,Association of Alternative Newsmedia,"Austin, TX",2019,5,31,"City Council to Continue Considering Scooters in August. With basic rules in place, regulatory framework remains undecided. Having approved at last week's meeting, May 23, rules of the road (and sidewalk) for scooters and other ""micro-mobility"" devices, City Council still has to grapple with the rules of the marketplace where they operate; consideration of those draft ordinances has been deferred until August. For now, scooter and dockless bike and e-bike riders can use sidewalks throughout the city, as long as they ride in a ""reasonable and prudent manner"" – a deliberately vague phrase intended to help law enforcement determine culpability after an incident, instead of defining behavior they would proactively police. Riders can also use electronic devices in hands-free mode; parents are responsible for ensuring children under 18 wear helmets; and more than one rider per scooter is not allowed. Violators face warnings, then fines should they continue to misbehave. As for riding on trails and parkland, the city's current pilot program allowing scooters on certain trails will wrap up by summer's end, with additional rules to be crafted thereafter. The harder part has been establishing a regulatory framework for how micro-mobility providers interact with the city – right now, that mostly means Bird, Lime, JUMP (an Uber brand), and Lyft. Initially, staff recommended a franchise model such as the city uses for taxis, but the providers say that would be too cumbersome; operators would need Council approval at multiple meetings before they could enter the market or make major changes to their current fleets. Council Members Jimmy Flannigan, Paige Ellis, and Natasha Harper-Madison were receptive to this reasoning and jointly moved to postpone approvals until after Council's summer break. Their motion also directed staff to work with stakeholders to ""explore, develop, and present all potential models"" for regulating micro-mobility companies – including a ""revised franchise model."" These models should include ""basic design specifications"" to make riding with different companies safer and more consistent; encouragement of competition in the market to spread the devices, ""especially in areas outside downtown""; rules for data sharing with governmental entities without infringing upon civil liberties; and, crucially, a way to bring in revenue to support the ""expansion of infrastructure that supports safe operation of micro-mobility devices and bicycles."" In a conversation with the Chronicle this week, Flannigan emphasized that he was not necessarily opposed to a franchise model, but he was unsatisfied with simply repurposing the existing taxi system. With state-imposed revenue caps now looming, he explained, it's important for the city to think through its partnerships with private companies: ""I'm hoping to see a model that allows the city to collect a fair fee for [enabling] commerce in the public right of way, and I'm hopeful that we will see a minimum set of standards for the physical devices themselves."" Staff sees the franchise model as a proven way to collect fees that could then be spent on the city's mobility infrastructure. Jason JonMichael, assistant director of the Austin Transportation Department, said it would be critical for the city to cover not only capital improvements but administrative costs; it's too early to say what other options could work, but ATD and the city's lawyers have the summer to find out. The time City Hall has already invested in micro-mobility reflects how scooters are likely not a fad, but a feature of our future. This May alone, more than 480,000 individual micro-mobility trips have been taken in Austin (93% of those on scooters), with nearly 17,000 devices on the street and an average trip length of just over a mile. (ATD notes that this exceeds the number of automobile trips of similar length.) While anecdotes cast scooters as a scourge on our streets, the data suggests they are helping the city achieve the goal, adopted with the Austin Strategic Mobility Plan in April, of a 50-50 mode split between single-driver car trips and less carbon-laden and injury-prone modes of transportation. Advocates insist micros can only be useful to the extent that policymakers prioritize their usage over cars. That means improving comfort and safety by building out mobility infrastructure for modes other than cars, but it also means disincentivizing driving and encouraging transit use, with scooters and bikes as a ""first/last mile"" solution. As UT professor and transportation researcher Alex Karner told the Chronicle, ""Ideally we want to create a city where we don't have to get into a car. ... If we want to do that, walking, scooting, or using a wheelchair has to become safe and normal."" With some on Council still largely viewing scooters as a hazard that pedestrians need protection from, it's unclear how hard the city will push for this outcome, although scooters clearly need to be factored into our consideration of walkable communities and transit corridors.",https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2019-05-31/city-council-to-continue-considering-scooters-in-august/

An electrical failure with the generators caused the fire, according to AFD. Officials say at least one person was out of the truck collecting scooters when the fire started. An individual still in the truck noticed the fire, hopped out and called 911. The flatbed of the truck and 23 scooters and generators were considered a total loss.

New company rides into Austin with 500 more scooters,kxan,NBC,"Austin, TX",2019,6,22,"New company rides into Austin with 500 more scooters. Just when you thought Austin couldn’t possibly hold any more scooters, a new company is hitting the scene. Skip, a California based company, already has its electronic scooters in two cities: San Francisco and Washington D.C. The company is the latest company to bring two wheels to these city streets. It will bring 500 more by Friday. Skip unveiled their scooters at the Scooter Safety Summit in downtown Austin. The summit was hosted by Austin City Council Member Kathie Tovo to help educate people on proper e-scooter rules and safety requirements. Multiple scooter companies attended the event as well as representatives from the Austin Transportation Department, Austin Police Department, Austin Parks and Recreation Department. “Austin is a great choice to expand our services and we’re really excited to be here,” said Greg Stewart, the operations manager for Skip. “We have worked hard with Austin and city council to ensure that we will be operating as a partnership rather than a company coming in and dropping scooters off,” Stewart said. That’ll total eight companies with wheels on the ground, with two more on the way. Transportation companies’ Razor and Wind Mobility have both been approved to launch in Austin. That’ll add 700 more scooters to the market. The summit was held at Kathie Tovo’s District 9 office. Tovo has the highest scooter rate in her district. “They want to continue operating here and have been really responsive to the ways Austin is regulating their appropriate use,” Tovo said. Austinites can expect the new scooters on the streets starting Monday. By the end of the week, Skip is expecting to have 500 new scooters riding through Austin. The fact of the matter is, people have really enjoyed the ride so far. City data shows Austinites have taken over four million scooter trips since the initiative launched last year. While Tovo says she hears concerns about a lack of parking, sidewalk clutter and danger to pedestrians and drivers, she thinks there’s still room to grow. “Over time, this will probably balance out as we get a sense of what our market can bare.” Austin’s City Council is currently working with the companies to find a way to limit the speed and usage of the scooters in certain sections of the city, a term called geo-fencing. It’s already being used on the UT campus. At this point, the technology isn’t developed yet to implement it elsewhere.",https://www.kxan.com/top-stories/new-company-rides-into-austin-with-500-more-scooters/
The death of the sidewalk? It’s scooters vs pedestrians — and scooters are winning,Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2019,6,30,"The death of the sidewalk? It’s scooters vs pedestrians — and scooters are winning. Big cities across the US are trying to deal with the advent of rentable electric scooters vying for space alongside pedestrians on the crowded pavement. On a summer afternoon in 1894, William Barkalow had a drink or three and got on his horse. He rode it down the central sidewalk of Long Branch, New Jersey, where horses were, even in those primordial days of traffic regulation, definitely not supposed to go. Barkalow rode amongst the foot traffic like an electric scooter before its time. The next day’s New York Times reported that he paid no heed to a police officer’s shouts, nor the billy club flung at him. And while Barkalow didn’t trample anyone, his breach of sidewalk ettiquette proved so intolerable that the officer finally shot him between the shoulder blades. The turn of the century was a rough time in the history of the sidewalk. Ubiquitous strips of not-street were squeezed thinner and thinner to make way for horses, trolleys and eventually lanes of automobiles. The footed masses fought with vendors and construction crews for the leftover pavement as if it were some Mesopotamian riverbed. “The pedestrians now, as formerly, must spend their time in a hurdle race over skids, climb platforms, dodge moving boxes or else run the risk of being crushed under horses’ hoofs in the street,” the Times complained in 1896, as part of its newly launched “crusade against the sidewalk grabbers.” There’s a new kind of sidewalk grabber today - more agile than Barkalow’s horse, popping seemingly from nowhere into the paths of pedestrians at 10,15, 20 mph. Thousands of rentable electric scooters have taken over pavement from Washington, D.C., to Santa Monica and Austin to Chicago. They clog narrow sidewalks, startle us from our ambulatory texting sessions, and lay strewn in the middle of crosswalks. It’s hard to recall a time in living memory when it’s been more nerve wracking to attempt a stroll. The physical injuries are one thing: A 75-year-old man tripped over an abandoned scooter in San Diego and shattered his knee. A 7-year-old boy near Los Angeles reportedly had his teeth knocked out by a scooter rider. A 44-year-old woman was hit by a Bird in a Cincinnati intersection. The assailant had their Bird account suspended, while the woman got a $1,000 medical bill. And on the other side of the gutter, car-on-scooter fatalities are becoming almost commonplace. But for every broken tooth there are countless jostled states of mind, as pedestrians discover the placid streams by which they travel have been invaded en masse by machines with names like Bird and Jump and Spin and Skip. Jacob Hege, 22, has walked to work a bit more cautiously since last Tuesday morning, when he emerged from a crosswalk on 16th Street NW in Washington and felt something thwack him from behind. He turned to see a woman on a Bird scooter, which like several other brands in the District of Columbia can be found on almost any block and rented for a few dollars. “We both got knocked to the side,” Hege said. “She had AirPods in, and she looked at me with such anger and said, ‘Move!’ and scooted away. And I stood looking at her like, what?” Once again, there’s a people’s crusade to restore the sanctity of the sidewalk, with anti-scooter vigilantes appearing wherever the machines do. Scooters are piled into dumpsters, chucked into rivers, thrown through windshields, set on fire and hung from bridge posts like apparatchiks of a deposed regime. In Hoboken, New Jersey - the state’s first major beachhead for scooters - an anonymous Twitter documentarian records riders buzzing strollers and smashing into each other. In Atlanta, a man in a wheelchair who calls himself John Plantaseed has taken to knocking down rows of scooters like chains of dominoes, yelling triumphant obscenities as they clatter to the pavement. Cities are trying to mitigate the backlash. Washington will begin experimenting with solar-powered charging docks, hoping to break riders’ habit of dumping the scooters wherever they happen to get off. But sometimes no balance can be found. Nashville’s mayor is now seeking to evict all scooters from the streets. We could use some perspective, because this is not the first sidewalk war by any means. The first known sidewalks were laid in central Anatolia around 2000 B.C. - a millennium or two after the invention of the wheel, according to the book “Sidewalks: Conflict and Negotiation over Public Space.” They remained rare luxuries in most of the world until the the 19th century, when the big cities like London and Paris built hundreds of miles of the stuff. But it took decades of social conditioning before “walk” became the operative syllable in sidewalk. For most of human history, vehicles, pedestrians, vendors, musicians, drinkers and strolling lovers all mingled in the same amorphous muck of the avenue. It’s only in the last century or so that those corridors have been divided up, stratified, painted with lines regulated in the name of more efficient movement. Jaywalkers - a word that did not exist until the early 20th century - were shamed and fined for straying into the street. Non-walkers were similarly penalized for clogging up the precious sidewalks. “City after city started issuing ordinances prohibiting or regulating a number of sidewalk activities from street vending to political and commercial speech, from the display of wares on the sidewalk to loitering, panhandling, and prostitution,” reads the book. Detroit went so far as to paint “huge yellow footsteps” on its sidewalks in the 1920s, lest any ped fail to get the message. This social order worked fine, except when it didn’t. Bicycles, newspaper boxes, mass homelessness, plodding iPhone gazers - all these things disturbed the fiction of a street neatly divided into walkers and cars. Cities simply invented new regulations and lanes to restore the peace, which worked until the next disruption came along, and here we are today in scooter hell. But is it a hell made by scooters, or just made apparent by them? “I see this conflict more as an outcome of bad decisions and bad design,” said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, co-author of “Sidewalks” and an urban planning professor at the scooter-saturated campus of UCLA. “Cities kept widening the streets and narrowing the sidewalks, and downgrading activities to accommodate only walking. ... I don’t mean to say sometimes scooter drivers are not obnoxious. But I’d say it’s a less obnoxious use than cars.” Loukaitou-Sideris expects the cities will find a way out of this jam, whether by restricting scooters or squeezing yet more lanes into the finite space between buildings. Sidewalk disputes always resolve one way or the other. Just ask William Barkalow.",https://www.statesman.com/zz/news/20190630/death-of-sidewalk-its-scooters-vs-pedestrians---and-scooters-are-winning
"As Scooters Proliferate, How Are Cities Managing The Chaos?",KUT,NPR,"Austin, TX",2019,7,4,"As Scooters Proliferate, How Are Cities Managing The Chaos? If they're in your city, you've certainly seen them, and you've probably formed an opinion about electric scooters – personal transportation devices that are ubiquitous in most urban Texas areas. (Though Houston has been more resistant.) Many, mainly younger people, have flocked to the fleet of scooters from companies like Bird, Uber, Lyft and Lime. Scooter boosters say the vehicles – easily available, unlockable via apps and priced by the minute – are an inexpensive and eco-friendly way to get around a city's urban core. Their detractors point to an uptick in visits to hospital emergency rooms by riders and innocent bystanders, plus the obstruction of sidewalks, which is an especially tough issue for people with disabilities, to say little of the clutter along college drags from Austin to downtown Dallas to beachside Corpus Christi. Texas Standard's Joy Diaz spoke with three public radio reporters who cover transportation. In San Antonio, scooters are no longer allowed on city sidewalks. Paul Flahive, technology and entrepreneurship reporter for Texas Public Radio in San Antonio, says that even with sidewalks cleared of riders, scooter parking is a big issue. ""The biggest con for pedestrians is that it blocks pedestrian right-of-ways,"" Flahive says. KUT Austin digital reporter Andrew Weber agrees. He says Austin has created parking areas for scooters, but they haven't been used as much as city leaders would like. ""There are 15,000 of these scooters in Austin, so it's the most visible complaint that they're parked sort of haphazardly, and that they're a hazard to folks who may be using a wheelchair,"" Weber says. Gail Delaughter, transportation reporter for Houston Public Media, says scooter company Lime tried to convince the city to allow scooters in Houston by pointing to its own data showing that 40% of scooter rides replaced a car trip. ""In a car culture here in Houston, people are tempted to jump in the car for a trip of any amount,"" Delaughter says. ""Maybe it's a hot day, it's very steamy outside, you've got to go one-third of a mile down the road … you're just going to jump in the car and do it because it's more convenient."" Weber says scooters first came to Austin in April 2018. Since then, some 4.5 million scooter rides have been taken in the city. ""The city didn't really have rules that were codified until May [of this year],"" Weber says. ""And those rules just went into effect this week."" Weber says reports of scooter injuries led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the scooter phenomenon in Austin. Of the 200 injuries reported in a three-month period, only one scooter rider was wearing a helmet. ""The city is not requiring folks to wear a helmet unless you're under the age of 18,"" Weber says. ""You can't double up on a single scooter, and you can ride on a sidewalk in Austin, but it's kind of encouraged not to, if you can."" Delaughter says Houston is using scooter data from other cities to inform its rules. In San Antonio, advocates of pedestrian travel are pro-scooter. They say scooters are comparable to bikes in terms of their impact on cities. Weber says many in Austin say scooters are different from bikes because they don't have dedicated travel lanes, as bikes do in some parts of the city. Delaughter says conflicts among drivers, cyclists, scooter users and pedestrians often devolve into disputes over ""who owns the streets."" ""That whole idea of sharing the streets safely, and not just as an avenue of travel for people in cars, but other road users as well,"" Delaughter says. Flahive says San Antonio has taken a cautious approach to regulating the way users of all transportation modes share the road. ""I think that there's a lot of questions around the benefits of scooters that still are out there,"" Flahive says. ""Even when we say that it's an energy-saving or a more carbon-neutral way of travel ... we don't know how long these things last. There's a lot of questions about the lifecycle of these things on the streets."" Delaughter says scooter rules in Houston are in an early stage. The city will begin engaging with stakeholders later this summer. She says Houston is focusing on where scooters are left when the ride is complete.",https://www.kut.org/post/scooters-proliferate-how-are-cities-managing-chaos
86th Legislative session zooms past safety regulations for e-scooters,Reform Austin,,"Austin, TX",2019,7,10,"86th Legislative session zooms past safety regulations for e-scooters. Across Texas over the past year, several companies have swooped down on cities—including San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and El Paso—with fleets of e-scooters, leaving officials scrambling to pass ordinances to regulate this new transportation service. Companies like Bird Ride and LimeBike contend that their scooters provide necessary solutions to congested highways and roads, but local government is often left picking up the pieces from clashes over best safety practices and the free market economy. To use a scooter, the rider simply has to rent one through a mobile app, pay $1 to unlock the scooter, and pay an additional 15 cents per minute. The service will drop off a scooter to a rider, and allows users to park the scooters virtually anywhere when done riding. And with Bird Ride implemented in 100 cities worldwide, the ease in which anyone can rent a scooter is causing local governments to quickly come up with solutions to prevent scooter-littered streets and parks. Similar to rideshare services like Uber and Lyft, the scooter companies would rather ask for forgiveness rather than permission, bypassing lengthy processes of waiting for officials to come up with city-led plans for a dockless mobility service. Once multiple fleets of scooters arrived in Austin, city council members worked tirelessly to pass ordinances prohibiting leaving scooters or bikes on sidewalks and streets until permit processes could be put in place. In El Paso, local officials ordered the confiscation of any Bird scooters in town after the California-based company deployed scooters near downtown and college campuses. Likewise in Dallas, officials requested scooter companies to self-regulate by tracking their fleets better, but were fearful of any regulatory fees that may cause the companies to withdraw their services from the city. These issues create a challenge to local officials: where do they draw the line between public safety versus profiting as a result of companies investing in solutions for local infrastructure? David Estrada, the chief legal officer for Bird Ride, says that scooters provide a needed resolution for heavily-congested streets. “The only way that we can solve this problem is if we have enough of this alternative public transportation on the road,” Estrada said. “If cities want to solve traffic they need to embrace this type of solution. If they over-restrict it…we are choosing cars. We need to choose less cars.” However, one main reason that cities regulate scooter companies is due to safety concerns and scooter-related injuries to riders, several resulting in fatalities. While there is a clear lack of data regarding scooter safety, the Center for Disease Control will conduct a study set to analyze incidents that occurred in Austin in the fall of 2018, at the request of the Austin Public Health and Transportation departments. Ford Vox for CNN wrote that “when health and safety is on the line, it is crucial that one company’s legitimate right to come up with a handy new product…doesn’t infringe on your right to move freely in public spaces without fear of serious injury.” To this point, the Coalition of Texans with Disabilities has advocated for stricter regulations as riders who frequently leave their scooters haphazardly strewn about city sidewalks and streets cause cumbersome mobility and safety issues for people living with disabilities. Senator Royce West (D-Dallas) filed SB 549 this past session, which focused on statewide regulations for e-scooters by limiting scooter riding on sidewalks, requiring scooter riders to be at least 16 years of age, and setting speed limits to 15 miles per hour. The bill died in committee and was not passed, leaving local city governments to battle with scooter companies over regulations. In a landscape where many scooter companies simply pull their services from cities when faced with such regulations, the Legislature’s role to ensure safety standards for Texans could be crucial. In 2016, Austin’s attempts to regulate ridesharing companies Uber and Lyft were thwarted when the state Legislature overruled the local ordinance requirements, showcasing struggles between local and state control. When public safety becomes an issue in Texas cities where requirements differ for alternative transportation, the responsibility lies with the state to ultimately find a happy medium.",https://www.reformaustin.org/texas-legislature/86th-legislative-session-zooms-past-safety-regulations-for-e-scooters/

"New generation of Lime scooters in Austin come with upgraded safety features, company says",KVUE,ABC,"Austin, TX",2019,8,22,"New generation of Lime scooters in Austin come with upgraded safety features, company says. The scooters will feature three forms of braking. Lime debuted their ""Gen 3"" scooters that aim to be safer, more durable and have a better rider experience. So, what changes have been made? To ensure safety, Lime scooters wheels have grown from 8 inches to 10 inches in diameter. This change will provide the scooter with more stability and tire grip along with shock absorptions for those bumpy paths. ""We built this scooter to cruise on urban terrain with ease,"" said Joe Deshotel, Lime Texas government relations and community relations manager. The wheels are also mountain-bike style with two-sided suspension on the front wheels. This model of the Lime scooter will be the first to have this type of technology. A Lime dockless electric scooter is parked on a Wilshire Boulevard sidewalk, available for its next rider, on July 9, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. What about the brakes? Gen 3 will have not have one, but three forms of braking. There will be mechanical braking on the front wheel along with electrical and mechanical braking on the rear wheel. RELATED: 8 Austin-based lawsuits filed against scooter companies in 6 days Austin City Council approves scooter rider rules, postpones company regulations Being able to park will also be easier. Lime has developed virtual parking zones to help riders park in approved areas by the city. Crucial parts of the scooter were also built with waterproofing technology to protect from multiple types of weather conditions. The battery life was upgraded as well, extending the range of a scooter by 50%, adding up to about 30 extra miles. An LED light strip will inform riders if the scooter is charged without having to look at their app. With Lime having multiple lawsuits in their past, they're working on how to pursue rider safety and hope to incorporate personalized rider messages, step-by-step navigation and more in the future. The response The speed limit is the same with these new scooters. The speed still caps out at 15 miles per hour. Lime is also trying to educate riders with its First Ride program. ""The City of Austin partnered with the CDC, to do a study on scooter safety,"" said Joe Deshotel. ""One of the main things that came out of that was that a third of all scooter accidents happened on the very first ride."" The City's health department told KVUE it does not have updated scooter crash numbers. Jessamy Tomlinson works downtown and said having the battery at the bottom of the scooter helps. “I also like the idea of the screen,” she said. “And how it will show you different things, like where to park.” Not everyone cares for the changes. “I don't see the point in spending money on a ride,” said Robert Allen, who also works downtown. “It's nice to walk.

Doctors rushed Green to the ICU to run a series of tests measuring the severity of her injuries. Things were worse than she’d imagined. The trauma caused by her head hitting the ground (she wasn’t wearing a helmet at the time of the crash) had created several lacerations on her lips and cheek that required stitches. A large hematoma had also developed under her right eyebrow from a broken blood vessel, causing her eye to swell completely shut. Even more concerning, CT scans revealed that her brain was bleeding from three separate places along its frontal lobe, the area often referred to as the mind’s “control panel” due to its role in cognitive functions like memory and emotional expression. Looking back, she says she remembers almost nothing about the time she spent in the hospital.

Like many Austinites, Green initially met the scooters with resistance. But as the months passed, their novelty and accessibility drew her in. By the time she and her son hit their accelerators and sped down to the Broken Spoke that day, the pair had logged close to 20 rides together. They didn’t know it at the time, but this one would be their last. Less than a quarter mile from home, Green veered onto a quiet residential street when, suddenly, her scooter wouldn’t slow down. She squeezed the hand brake again and again, but nothing happened. The device pushed ahead, its speedometer hovering around 8 miles an hour as its occupant frantically searched for an escape. A moment later, she lost her balance and fell forward. Everything went black after that. When she came to, Green was met by a throbbing pain above her right eye and the sounds of her son’s screams. They were in the back of an ambulance head-ed to St. David’s South Austin Medical Center; minutes before, a passerby had found her face-down in the middle of the road, blood pooling onto the pavement. As her face swelled, she tried to comfort her son. “It’s OK, it’s OK,” she whispered to him. “It looks worse than what it is, baby.” Photo by Sara Marie D’Eugenio. Doctors rushed Green to the ICU to run a series of tests measuring the severity of her injuries. Things were worse than she’d imagined. The trauma caused by her head hitting the ground (she wasn’t wearing a helmet at the time of the crash) had created several lacerations on her lips and cheek that required stitches. A large hematoma had also developed under her right eyebrow from a broken blood vessel, causing her eye to swell completely shut. Even more concerning, CT scans revealed that her brain was bleeding from three separate places along its frontal lobe, the area often referred to as the mind’s “control panel” due to its role in cognitive functions like memory and emotional expression. Looking back, she says she remembers almost nothing about the time she spent in the hospital. Green was eventually released from the ICU after three days, but the accident’s impacts—which include memory loss and $75,000 in medical bills—have left her with physical and emotional scar tissue that haunt her to this day. “I have to deal with cluster headaches day-to-day; I don’t know when they’re going to come or when they’re going to go. Working a regular job, it gets hard,” she says. “My son isn’t the same. He starts crying if anybody talks about the accident or if we’re driving down the road and we see someone on a scooter.” Last spring, e-scooters hit downtown Austin in a tsunami of tech-bro bluster and lithium ion batteries. Seemingly overnight, street corners became veritable pincushions, with their aluminum chassis leaning against every lamp post, fire hydrant, and bus kiosk. Industry heavyweights like the San Francisco–based Lime and Santa Monica’s Bird had already established a strong presence in California’s biggest cities, but they were an initial oddity on Texas roads. Despite their sudden, fish-out-of-water presence, local lawmakers, eager to strengthen Austin’s transit offerings, welcomed the scooters’ arrival with open arms. “We recognized that this was a new mode of transportation that we could see value in,” says Jason Redfern, who heads Austin’s parking enterprise division. “Companies put these devices out on the sidewalk and, with just a few taps, you’re off and running.” Redfern’s perspective reflects the city’s growing emphasis on “micromobility,” a buzzword for the rentable e-bikes, scooters, and similar compact devices that have become popular short-distance transit tools around the country. Like many tasked with solving Austin’s traffic woes, Redfern sees car-free transportation as a crucial element that will also help to reduce residents’ carbon footprint. Austinites have had access to alternative transportation options (such as bike share services) for several years now. But whether it’s because they can be stored sans dock alongside busy thoroughfares, or the cheap, convenient transit they offer riders, scooters have unquestionably become the top option for daily commuters and visitors during events like SXSW and the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Case in point: Over the course of last year’s ACL Fest, riders took more than 90,000 trips and traveled more than 150,000 miles with Lime (one of seven companies currently operating in Austin) alone. The City of Austin has played a central role in this phenomenon. Unlike New York City, San Francisco, and Atlanta—all of which have either imposed temporary bans before selecting a shortlist of preferred providers, or established heavily regulated protocols—local government, by and large, has allowed them to operate autonomously. Redfern argues this approach allows companies the creativity to breathe freely, a sentiment that reflects the market-and-consumer-driven attitude so pervasive throughout the tech world. This hands-off approach can hurt businesses and consumers if taken too far, cautions Joe Deshotel, Lime’s manager of government relations and community affairs. Pinning a crowded field of competitors against one another in a saturated market doesn’t inspire innovation; it fuels a fight for survival that can stymie progress and limit the impact of local ordinances (such as the ongoing ban of scooters from the Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail). “It’s difficult to have a sustainable business when there’s nearly 10 companies operating at once,” he says. “Our goal has been to stabilize markets, cutting them down to four competitors, max. That will allow for closer monitoring and the establishment of clear-cut, permanent rules.” When left to fester, Deshotel says, marketplace instability can force companies to double down on their economic viability instead of prioritizing the development of newer technology. But if you ask public health experts, the safety issues posed by scooter companies have already surpassed their bottom lines. * * * In May 2018, Dr. Christopher Ziebell received a call from Robert Buchanan, a neurosurgeon at UT’s Dell Seton Medical Center. Over the previous three weeks, he’d noticed that a startling trend had begun to emerge, with doctors conducting intensive brain surgery on multiple college students who’d crashed aboard e-scooters. “I think we might have a problem here,” Buchanan warned. Ziebell looked at the patient intake information at Dell Seton, where he’s head of the emergency department, and confirmed the surgeon’s suspicions. He estimates that the hospital now treats close to 10 scooter-related injuries per day, many of which involve serious head trauma. “Someone who breaks their arm is going to be fine in the long run. What I’m much more worried about is cases like the kid we had come in last May; he was leaving his graduation ceremony and, while on a scooter, got in a wreck, sustained a very serious brain injury, and is going to live the rest of his life in a nursing home,” he says. “His life is literally ruined.” What’s worse, according to Ziebell, is that these kinds of injuries are avoidable. Like Misty Green, the aforementioned student wasn’t wearing a helmet. “To this day, I still don’t really see people wearing helmets on scooters, which is disturbing. We’re seeing way more people come in from scooter injuries than bike injuries.” he says. “If you hit something and your scooter stops, momentum keeps you moving forward: you become this head-first thing flying through the air.” Tracking the frequency of these injuries has proven to be challenging. Doctors typically use a series of codes to internally label the cause for someone’s visit, making it easy to compile data and identify public health trends within a community. But because scooters are relatively new, the most recent medical code book doesn’t include injuries sustained upon them—a frustrating reality when there are codes for even the most audacious occurrences, such as a skier crashing into a tree…while their skis are on fire. Without a reliable way to locate this information, Ziebell’s team has taken to manually logging data from notes in emergency room incident reports. This proved to be key when, last fall, Austin’s Department of Public Health teamed up with researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct the first scooter safety study overseen by federal epidemiologists. Using statistics compiled from September to November 2018, the study identified 192 confirmed or probable cases of scooter-related injuries. According to researchers, nearly half of people surveyed had sustained trauma to their heads, including 15 percent who’d endured a traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, a third were from out of town, 29 percent had consumed alcohol within 12 hours of riding, and 35 percent were aboard a scooter for the very first time. To Ziebell’s point, the study found that only one person was wearing a helmet at the time of their accident. The CDC’s study made headlines across the country, with many outlets pointing to Austin’s streets as proof of the dangers e-scooters pose. However, little attention was paid to a statistic buried in the document’s “additional notes” section: Nearly a fifth of riders said their injuries occurred because of mech-anical malfunctions. Over the past year, Jack Zinda, who heads the Austin-based Zinda Law Group, has received a flood of calls from people claiming they were seriously hurt while riding faulty machines. As of October, Zinda’s firm has taken on 20 clients (including Misty Green), all of whom were riding either Bird or Lime scooters. In each case, Zinda says he’s encountered the same recurring issues. “These scooter companies have all the information. They have all the evidence,” he says. “Up to this point, we have yet to have a case where a scooter company has made the machine in question available for inspection.” Lawyer Rian Butler, who’s heading Green’s case alongside Zinda, says this has made it impossible to establish the validity of claims made by clients like Jared Samuels. In late July, the 56-year-old mechanic nearly lost his nose after being thrown over the handlebars of his Bird scooter in San Antonio. Samuels claims his accident was caused by his device stopping unexpectedly. “I was bleeding out of this hole in my face where my nose should have been, I was bleeding out of my mouth, I was bleeding out of my eyes,” he says. “They got me sewed up, but I own my own business and I can’t really work on cars like I could before.” Although consumers routinely ignore the legalese regarding their phones, apps, and computers, scooter companies’ user agreements are among the first to have physical ramifications. Both Bird and Lime require riders to sign lengthy contracts (49 and 48 pages, respectively) that are littered with convoluted jargon they know users are unlikely to read. For starters, the fine print on Lime’s agreement states that the company isn’t liable for more than $100 worth of damages, regardless of circumstances. While Bird’s doesn’t specify a pay-out amount, Butler says, it contains clauses with the intent to make customers assume all risks stemming from situations involving a malfunctioning device. Each company also attempts to require users to consent to closed-door, settlement-based legal proceedings known as arbitration hearings. “The seventh amendment says you’re entitled to a trial by jury; this is a corporate takeover of that right,” Zinda says. “It’s scary to think you can be stripped of your ability to publicly appear in a court of law and be forced to go in front of a private corporate lawyer instead.” [Note: When questioned about this matter, Lime’s legal team said the following: “The user agreement is standard across most technology companies.” Bird did not respond to multiple inquiries made prior to going to print.] * * * There’s an unmistakable air of ambiguity when it comes to scooter safety—a wait-and-see approach that applies to every character, statistic, and claim involved in this story. Among advocates, there’s a clear-cut desire to show that progress is being made, that the technology and infrastructure needed for reliable micromobility is steadily improving. “To convert somebody to the pro-dockless, pro-bike model, you really have to show them how it benefits them. Environmentally, there’s an offset by carbon emissions; if you build infrastructure, one of our main goals moving forward, people can see its impact on traffic,” Redfern says. “People have to see those benefits. That’s Austin’s next challenge.” Scooter companies have taken a similar stance. “Our company is two years old and this industry is barely a year old—and yet, we’re already on our sixth generation of scooter,” Deshotel says. “That just tells you how quickly we’re innovating, and how many new technologies we’re creating, both in terms of hardware and software.” Nonetheless, the medical community has shown these types of devices pose serious health hazards. A recent North Carolina State University study found that producing and maintaining them creates more greenhouse gas emissions per passenger than taking the bus or riding an electric bike. There are also legal concerns about the business tactics being deployed by industry juggernauts and what they could mean for American consumers. What local government has made clear, though, is that scooters are here to stay. In late fall, Austin City Council was scheduled to convene with top transportation stakeholders to fortify the city’s relationship with micromobility companies, key players in its effort to reduce residents’ dependence on cars. While the impact of these meetings are still up in the air, lawmakers believe that with time, money, and public support, Austinites will see better infrastructure (like bike lanes and improved sidewalks), a more robust selection of transportation options, and sturdier, safer means of transport in the coming years. This strategy may one day yield the benefits that policymakers and corporate partners promise, but its reliance on making real-time changes to existing technologies—and the irreversible impacts it’s had on the lives of many people like Misty Green—can’t be overlooked. “These days, normal for me means I don’t have to go to the doctor regularly, that I don’t have to deal with constant, painful headaches, that I don’t have to hear my son crying every time he sees someone riding a scooter on the street,” Green sighs. “It just is what it is. I’m going to have continuing medical issues. My son is traumatized; I’m traumatized. It’s just something you have to come to terms with and move forward.”",https://www.austinmonthly.com/are-scooters-just-a-health-risk-yet-to-be-addressed/
"City survey finds scooters are problematic on hike and bike trails, suggests banning them",CBS Austin,CBS,"Austin, TX",2019,12,3,"City survey finds scooters are problematic on hike and bike trails, suggests banning them. Love them or hate them, the city is still reviewing data surrounding how scooters can best be used in Austin. On Tuesday night, the Parks and Recreation board heard a presentation with suggested recommendations on how scooters can co-exist on city park trails. This comes after an eight-month survey involving extensive citizen communication and a pilot program where scooters were allowed on selected park trails: Johnson Creek. Shoal Creek (south of 15th street). Northern and Southern Walnut Creek Trail. The Boardwalk. Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail at Lady Bird Lake. The suggested recommendations sought to allow electric scooters on limited paved parkland trails except for the Hike and Bike Trail – an area of Austin that could see more than 5,000 people a day. “Public Sediment is the strongest about concerns associated with electric scooters on that trial,” said Amanda Ross with Parks and Recreation. Data from the presentation shows about 10% of all electric bike and scooter trips from January to September 2019 started or ended on parkland. And the Hike and Bike trail saw the largest amount of electric bikes and scooters trips start and end compared to all other trails. Currently, the city has a geo-fence in place at the hike and bike trail which is a virtual area where scooters can’t go faster than eight miles an hour. “We’re looking at what to do to strengthen that as well,” said Ross when talking to reporters. Other suggested recommendations presented at Tuesday’s PARD Board meeting were designating parking areas, continuing geo fencing and “improve effectiveness.” Also, creating a “culture of shared trails with etiquette campaign.” “We’re all in this together and to some extent have to take some responsibility to share that trail,” said Ross. If council were to consider banning scooters from the hike and bike trail, Ross said that’s something that could be taken up sometime in January 2020.",https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/city-survey-finds-scooters-are-problematic-on-hike-and-bike-trail-suggests-to-ban-them
Lyft scooters land on Austin streets,Curbed Austin,Curbed,"Austin, TX",2019,12,4,"Lyft scooters land on Austin streets. Ride-hailing company joins the fray. Lyft, the only national ride-hailing company that has proven to provide any serious competition with Uber, jumped into the Austin scooter fray Tuesday. Its electric scooters will join those of Lime, Bird, and Uber’s Jump on city streets. Lyft is licensed to operate 500 of the increasingly popular vehicles in Austin.  Perhaps to avert the common objection that e-scooters and bikes are parked in a wanton manner, blocking sidewalks and thwarting accessibility in some places, Lyft will work with the city on placing docks for its scooters on streets with high demand and near transit stations. The company also announced that it will pick up scooters nightly for charging and maintenance, reallocating them throughout the city each morning.  Scooters will cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents for each minute of riding under Lyft’s one-year pilot program. As with Uber’s Jump line, Lyft scooter riders can use its existing app to rent and use the zippy electric vehicles. Austin is the fifth market where Lyft operates its scooter program. Its operating area will be in the city’s center and a few streets east, with the exception of the state Capitol grounds.",https://austin.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125331/austin-lyft-scooters-new-when-docks
Austin-based Unicorn Rides scooter company goes bankrupt,KVUE,ABC,"Austin, TX",2019,12,9,"Austin-based Unicorn Rides scooter company goes bankrupt. The company sold 350 scooters at $655 each. Now every customer is left without a scooter – and without a refund. An Austin startup is living up to its name: The scooters purchased through the electric scooter company Unicorn Rides don't exist. Unicorn Rides was a little different than the average scooter company. Instead of renting just any scooter off the street, the idea behind the company was to give customers their own personal scooter to ride. Founder Nick Evans said they came up with the idea in March and made a website and sold pre-sales in June. But by last Friday, they had to notify all of their customers that they would not be getting the scooters they pre-ordered – and they wouldn't get their money back either. ""We thought, 'Maybe we should sell scooters to people,'"" Evans said. ""We really thought it was amazing that something so simple like an electric scooter and the real utility it provides people for commuting."" Turns out, creating scooters isn't that simple. Evans is also the co-founder of Tile, an electronic location device that Unicorn Rides was planning to use on its scooters. ""It has just become one compounding thing after another that made it a huge challenge,"" Evans said. A portion of the email sent to customers stated, "" A large portion of the revenue went toward paying for Facebook ads to bring traffic to the site. A portion also went to our manufacturer in the form of a down payment to build the scooters, but unfortunately, that down payment cannot be redeemed for a portion of the scooters that we were planning to order. Unfortunately, the cost of the ads were just too expensive to build a sustainable business."" Evans said they sold about 350 scooters at $699 each. Some customers received codes for discounts on their purchases. Shelly Johnson in Ohio said she did not receive the discount but she bought two scooters in September, one for her and one for her spouse. She said she didn't know it was a pre-order until after she bought it. ""We quickly found out it was a pre-order after we found out it would be a month,"" Johnson said. ""Well, I contacted them, it was delayed two different times. In November, at that time, they gave us the date of Dec. 15."" Johnson said that date was an empty promise. She spent $160 out of pocket and used the loan company offered on the site for the other $1,238. ""They really pushed the financing. It said, 'If you can't afford our scooter, you can do financing,'"" Johnson said. Evans said they were trying to sell the company's assets to give refunds to customers. ""But someone has to buy it, someone has to be a buyer,"" Evans said. Evans said their new job is to find a way to get the customers their money back. ""I feel pretty bad, but we are trying to somehow turn this around into a positive for everyone who ordered,"" Evans said. "" I know this sounds unrealistic, but we are trying."" Johnson said she is trying to work with the loan company to get the loan off of her history.",https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-scooters-unicorn-rides-bankrupt/269-26d2d78a-fbe6-4d23-805e-230f17ae559d
Over 300 scooters pulled from Austin lakes and creeks; council members call it ‘alarming’,kxan,NBC,"Austin, TX",2020,1,23,"Over 300 scooters pulled from Austin lakes and creeks; council members call it ‘alarming’. Since electric scooters popped up on the streets of Austin in 2018, they’ve been spotted all around town, including in the city’s waterways. Last February, a number of scooters were found submerged in Lady Bird Lake. Local anglers Matt Mellor and Teddy Hall were out fishing when they noticed the scooters, from various companies, in the water. City officials told KXAN Thursday they now know more than 300 electric scooters were pulled from waterways since 2018. “Scooters serve a valuable mobility purpose, and they belong on the streets where people can use them, not in the creeks where they’re not helping anybody,” said City Council Member Paige Ellis. She added, “They also have batteries that are being recharged, and so that battery leakage is something that is very damaging to our environment.” Council approves Clean Creeks and Lakes resolution At Thursday’s Austin City Council meeting, the District 8 Council Member brought forward a resolution that directs City Manager Spencer Cronk to put together a study with recommendations to improve the city’s bodies of water. The study could cost $500,000. Ellis said, for now, Cronk is expected to come up with easier-to-achieve solutions by next month and explore other options that can be done in the next budget cycle. The resolution asks the city manager to look into illegally-dumped scooters and litter, and how it impacts the city’s waterways’ ecological health and safety. The last Watershed Protection Master Plan came out in 2016, and Ellis hopes the city will revisit and update the plan. She said the goal of the initiative is to work with various city departments to come up with a solution, including Watershed Protection, Parks and Recreation and Resource Recovery. Ellis added, another issue is the city’s plastic bag ban ordinance no longer being enforced. The Texas Supreme Court overturned that ordinance in 2018 allowing plastic bags to return in stores. Ellis believes this move adds to litter in the city’s waterways. “It’s very bad for the environment and we want to get everyone teaming up to really find a solution,” Ellis said. Fishing scooters out of Lady Bird Lake Right now, enforcement of the illegally dumped scooters works like this. Someone has to spot the scooter in the water and report it. The city then notifies the company, which then has 24 hours to get the scooter out. “I know at least one of the companies has spent over $100,000 themselves on divers, on people on kayaks to go get these devices,” said Robert Spillar, Director of Austin’s Transportation Department. He said, the companies have been responsive. “Each of these devices are $1,000 devices. They’re expensive devices. They’re not making money to them if they’re not in service, so they want to get them out as fast as possible.” Last year, the city implemented a “geofencing” solution to try to minimize the number of scooters being dumped into water. “Now scooter riders are no longer able to end their rides on bridges, so the scooters are no longer parked on bridges,” explained Robert Hebrink, Program Manager at the Watershed Protection Department. “We’ve seen that help tremendously with the number of reports of scooters in the waterways, so that’s one step of forward progress.” He said Watershed is also trying out new technology. “Submersible drones, sonar technology,” Hebrink told KXAN. “We’re just starting to take action in this new direction to be more proactive and get a feeling for the scope of the problem that has gone unidentified.” Watershed Protection Department officials said litter and scooters are considered a pollutant discharge to a waterway, a Class C misdemeanor. This could result in a fine up to $2,063 per violation, per day, issued by the Austin Municipal Court. If you see a scooter in an Austin waterway, you are asked to call Austin WPD’s 24-hour hotline at (512) 974-2550. Austin is not the only city dealing with this issue. In Portland, Ore., divers found 20 e-scooters in the Willamette River, a major tributary of the Columbia River.",https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/resolution-aims-to-tackle-illegal-scooter-dumping-and-litter-in-austins-waterways/
"Electric scooters should be allowed on some parkland trails, Austin Parks and Recreation says",kxan,NBC,"Austin, TX",2020,3,1,"Electric scooters should be allowed on some parkland trails, Austin Parks and Recreation says. Electric scooters should be allowed on some parkland trails in the Austin area, the Austin Parks and Recreation Department has said.  Following a pilot program that ran between January and September 2019, the department has recommended to the city that scooter use should be permitted on certain trails.  A memo addressed to Mayor Adler and the city council from Kimberly McNeeley, director of Austin Parks and Recreation, describes the results of the pilot and offers recommendations going forward.  Despite recommending scooter use on some trails, the Ann and Roy Butler Trail, which runs alongside Lady Bird Lake, should continue to be used as a hike and bike trail where scooters are not permitted, McNeeley wrote.  During the pilot study, electric scooters and bikes were allowed on some trails in Austin, including the Shoal Creek Trail south of 15th Street and the Johnson Creek Trail.  Educational pop-ups were introduced on the Ann and Roy Butler Trail, and trail etiquette signage was installed to communicate safe guidelines, according to the memo.  Analysis of 3-1-1 reports during that time showed scooter speed to be the most reported behavior that concerned trailer users.  As a result, geofencing was implemented in the final month of the pilot, limiting the vehicles’ speed to 8 mph.  In its recommendations, the Parks and Recreation Department said electric scooters should be allowed on identified paved parkland trails that were part of the pilot.  This would create a “culture of shared trails,” the memo said.  However, it was also recommended that the hike and bike trail should continue to operate without the use of electric scooters.  “With this additional use there will be a continued need to manage, evaluate and adjust to ensure that all trail users have a safe and enjoyable experience,” McNeeley wrote.",https://www.kxan.com/news/local/austin/electric-scooters-should-be-allowed-on-some-parkland-trails-austin-parks-and-recreation-says/
City of Austin explores ways to stop e-scooters from ending up in lake,kxan,NBC,"Austin, TX",2020,3,3,"City of Austin explores ways to stop e-scooters from ending up in lake. The City of Austin is planning a two-year study to explore the ways it can limit littering into Austin’s waterway — including electronic scooter litter. The study will search for solutions to discourage people from throwing electronic scooters into local lakes and creeks, according to a city memo released Tuesday. Last year, when a wave of electronic scooter companies made their presence in Austin, there were several reports of scooters discovered submerged in the Lady Bird Lake water. Electronic scooter company Lime was at least one scooter company expected to receive a notice of violation after numerous scooters were found in the water. The memo states the Austin Transportation Department is developing signs near waterways warning the public that dumping into waterways, which includes dockless devices or e-scooters, is punishable by fines up to $2,000. Soon the ATD and the Watershed Protection Department will partner together to locate any previously unseen electronic scooters remaining in Lady Bird Lake using underwater drones and sonar technologies, according to the memo. ATD is asking for information from current e-scooter providers on what measures they have taken other cities and can take in Austin to prevent the dumping of scooters. ATD has also distributed a survey to its National Association of City Transportation partner cities searching for other methods used to prevent illegal dumping of e-scooters, the memo states.

Coronavirus in Austin: Scooter app companies sanitizing rides,Statesman,USA Today,"Austin, TX",2020,3,16,"Coronavirus in Austin: Scooter app companies sanitizing rides. As Austinites adapt amid the coronavirus pandemic by washing their hands and staying home from work or school, one thing remains the same: Scooter rides are still happening.  While the number of trips are lower than last year, the city has reported thousands of electric stand-up scooter and bike trips so far this month.  No one can be sure how clean the last pair of hands on the handlebars were, but scooter and bike app companies are taking precautions to keep their devices clean.  E-scooters and bikes remain available for rental in Austin even as staying at home is being encouraged, city officials said. Ten shared mobility companies operate in Austin, including moped and vehicle companies. It would be up to each company to pull its devices from use, officials said.  As of Sunday, a total of 154,316 trips were taken using scooters and bikes in March, according to city data. During the same period last year, 428,740 trips were taken on scooters and bikes, according to city data.  Usage this month has dropped in comparison to the first half of March 2019 likely because the South by Southwest series of festivals were canceled this year because of the coronavirus outbreak. The city saw a jump in use of shared bikes and scooters last year during the festivals.  On Sunday, 5,984 trips were taken. On the same day in 2019, a total of 45,549 trips were taken, according to city data.  Here’s what each mobility company is doing amid the coronavirus pandemic:  Bird: Bird, which has 4,500 scooters in the Austin area, is increasing how often its devices are cleaned daily, officials said in a statement. The cleaning includes the sterilization of helmets.  Extra gloves and hand sanitizer are being given to employees that deal with the scooters, as well as hand sanitizer for its staff.  The company is upping how often they deep clean the scooters.  Scoot was acquired by Bird last summer, and will be following the same protocols as the Bird scooters. Scoot has 200 mopeds that are licensed to be used in the downtown area.  Jump:  Jump, which has 2,850 scooters and 2,000 e-bikes in the Austin area, has increased the frequency of cleaning, a statement Uber says.  All e-bikes and scooters coming in and out of warehouses are being disinfected and staff members that handle the devices are wearing gloves and washing their hands often, the statement says.  “We will be vigilant in our cleaning process, but we also encourage riders to clean the handles of their vehicle before and after use (for instance, with a disinfectant wipe),” the statement says.  Lime:  Lime, which has 5,000 scooters in the Austin area, is distributing hand sanitizers to its offices and warehouses and increasing how often scooters are cleaned and disinfected, according to statement from the company.  Staffers that handle scooters are being required to wear gloves and regularly wash their hands, the statement says.  OjO:  Ojo, which operates 500 scooters in the Austin area, is more frequently cleaning its scooters and is disinfecting them repeatedly throughout the day, a statement from the company says.  Employees are using hand sanitizer when dealing with the scooters. Spin:  With 1,000 scooters in the Austin area, Spin is increasing how often its devices are cleaned, a statement from the company says.  All Spin employees are required to wear gloves when handling the scooters, te statement says. Every time a scooter enters a warehouse, a Spin employee uses disinfectant to clean it.  Spin is encouraging its riders to disinfect scooter handlebars before riding, use hand sanitizers and wear gloves.  Wheels:  Wheels employees are cleaning the company’s 500 bikes in the Austin area more frequently, according to the company’s website.  The seat, handlebars, brake levers and body of the bieks are sprayed with a disinfectant and wiped down with a microfiber towel by employees who are wearing gloves, the website says. Warehouses where the bikes are stored are being cleaned with disinfectants and employees are regularly washing their hands.  Revel:  Revel has 500 mopeds licensed to be used in downtown Austin. The company is using disinfectants to clean handlebars, brake levers, helmet cases and seats, among other “high-touch” areas, according to a statement.  Helmets are being cleaned with disinfectant, including the visor and chin strap.  Zipcar:  Zipcar has, on average, 23 vehicles in the Austin area. The company said in a statement that its cleaning vehicles with antiviral and antimicrobial solutions.  The company is also promoting hygiene and safety practices to its employees. Lyft:  Lyft has 2,000 scooters in the Austin area. The Lyft website says the company is following updates on COVID-19 from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The company said rideshare and Bay Wheels (bicycles) will continue to operate as usual. Currently, the bicycles are not included on the City of Austin's list of devices that are licensed to operate in Austin. Starting April 29, Lyft will no longer be operating its dockless scooter service in Austin. The company said rideshare and Bay Wheels (bicycles) will continue to operate as usual. Currently, the bicycles are not included on the City of Austin's list of devices that are licensed to operate in Austin. Additionally, stay-home orders for Austin and Travis County went into effect on March 24, restricting travel for essential activities only. In March 2019, riders took 689,271 scooter trips. That dropped to 159,095 scooter trips in March 2020, according to the data. April's decline may also be related to limited scooter availability. According to the ATD, Lime, Spin and JUMP suspended their operations near the end of March. This week, however, Lime reactivated a small fleet of scooters in Austin to provide an essential service and offer free rides for health care workers and law enforcement officers through its Lime Aid program. ""The goal is to help workers who might otherwise have difficulty, either because they don't want to take public transit or rideshare or because the public transit is running with service reductions,"" according to Lime. As of last week, Lyft and Bird reduced their number of deployed units significantly or, like Lime, created programs to reduce the cost for essential workers and had not paused services. In addition, ATD has requested all shared micromobility companies to share how they plan to limit the spread of COVID-19. KVUE reached out to all of the companies listed on ATD's website about their sanitization protocols. Below are some of the responses they shared last week: Bird Increasing the daily frequency with which we clean and sanitize our vehicles in the field, including the sterilization of our helmets Increasing the frequency of our deep-clean “Bird Baths” that take place in our local service centers Providing extra gloves for our field service staff members as well as hand sanitizer for all Bird staff Closely monitoring the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO) and other trusted federal and global agencies to inform our hour-by-hour decisions ""Bird is committed to serving the city of Austin and providing critical and essential mobility options to our community. We know that micromobility can add a lot of good by facilitating essential tasks like commutes, grocery shopping, and medical appointments, and we look forward to continuing to offer a safe transportation option as the community gradually reopens."" Lime We have enhanced our cleaning methods and increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting our scooters. In our offices and warehouses, we are distributing hand sanitizer. All of our mechanics and operators in the field are required to wear gloves and wash their hands regularly. We’re following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), federal agencies, and other global health organizations to collect the most up-to-the-minute information to ensure the actions we're taking are comprehensive and expedient. Based on this information, we will decide to continue, pause, or suspend operations in certain markets. Just as you should wipe down public and shared surfaces with disinfectant, we encourage you to do the same before riding a scooter or bike. You could also consider wearing gloves as a precaution as well as washing your hands before and after riding. Lyft ""Our associates are frequently disinfecting all high contact surfaces on bikes and scooters. They do this every time vans are used to transport vehicles, bikes arrive at our depot, or scooters are docked for recharging, and they wear gloves when handling anything in the depot or at valets. We’re recommending that our associates also wear a cloth face covering, and we're distributing those wherever we can."" Spin ""Every time a scooter enters the warehouse or is collected from the street, the upper mast and handlebars are disinfected.

The company, which is licensed to operate 1,000 scooters in Austin, will deploy 240 devices to areas downtown, in East Austin, along East Riverside Drive and South Austin. More scooters will continue to be deployed, the company said in a statement. The company previously paused operations in Austin on March 26 as stay-at-home orders were issued to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Personal mobility companies Lime, Wheels and JUMP also paused operations in Austin during the pandemic. Bird reduced its fleet and Lyft pulled its scooters from Austin completely.

Spin rides will now cost 50 cents to unlock instead of $1 and 42 cents for each minute. Essential healthcare workers can get free 30-minute rides and helmets through Spin through May 30, the company said. Scooter usage across the city dropped significantly after many Austin residents were sent home to work and attend school remotely.

"Austin Transportation piloting e-scooter parking, charging stations",Fox7,Fox,"Austin, TX",2020,6,29,"Austin Transportation piloting e-scooter parking, charging stations. Austin Transportation has launched a six-month no-cost pilot project to test the usability of Swiftmile Inc's universal e-scooter parking and charging stations in downtown Austin and other high scooter traffic areas. The program will observe how effectively Swiftmile's stations can be used to manage sidewalk clutter, increase accessibility, and improve access to fully charged e-scooters. Over the next six months, any e-scooter will be able to park and eventually charge at the stations for free. The temporary stations are primarily located downtown and were chosen based on e-scooter travel patterns and data collected since April 2018. Ten stations will be deployed at the following locations: 900 Electric Dr. 609 Davis St. 1100 E. 5th St. 2104 Guadalupe St. 601 Congress Ave. 401 Congress Ave. 500 W. 2nd St. 302 E. Cesar Chavez. 114 Barton Springs Rd. 1412 S. Congress Ave. The pilot will be separated into two phases. During Phase I, the stations will be installed without batteries and will serve only as organized parking spaces for e-scooters, with each station offering six to eight spaces. Batteries will be added during Phase II, providing power and allowing scooters to charge while parked. Phase II is tentatively scheduled for late August. However, due to decreased ridership during COVID-19, the timeframe for launching Phase II will be determined by market forces and scooter data to ensure there are sufficient e-scooters to accurately evaluate outcomes. These stations will be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis throughout the life of the pilot. During this project, city staff and Swiftmile employees will conduct surveys to collect feedback related to the stations. The outcome of this pilot project will help inform programs and policies around scooters in the future.",https://www.fox7austin.com/news/austin-transportation-piloting-e-scooter-parking-charging-stations
"What Are the ""Next Normals"" for Scooters in Austin",Austin Chronicle,Association of Alternative Newsmedia,"Austin, TX",2020,7,10,"What Are the ""Next Normals"" for Scooters in Austin. The pandemic takes on personal mobility. Remember the good old days, back in March, when SXSW was just around the corner and it felt like there were about eleventy jillion scooters on Austin's streets? You all remember what happened next, and so do the micromobility companies. Instead of seeing 750,000 rides in March as many had expected (or three times the February total, as had happened in 2019), they ended the month with about 30% of that and headed steeply downhill. In April, there were only 10,551 micromobility trips. By the first of May, eight of the nine companies in the highly competitive and desirable Austin market had pulled their units off the streets. Back in May, we talked to the one remaining player in Austin – Bird's community relations lead Blanca Laborde – with the intention of writing about a ""new normal"" for mobility that again seemed just around the corner. ""We've gotten a glimpse of what Austin and other cities can look like – fewer cars, safer streets, cleaner air,"" Laborde told us then. ""There are a lot of benefits to personal mobility."" That month, there were just under 20,000 trips. ""We have a lot of data, so we'll keep looking at that data to adjust our operations to make sure people can get around."" “We’ve gotten a glimpse of what Austin and other cities can look like – fewer cars, safer streets, cleaner air.” – Blanca Laborde, Bird Scooters We also talked to other firms as they planned their Austin reemergence, some in new guises due to industry shake-ups augmented by the COVID crash. Then more things happened – protests and unrest, reopenings and now re-closings, with masks and without. As it's settled in that we'll be dealing with COVID-19 impacts for months to come, we're seeing one ""next normal"" after another in quick succession, what Jason JonMichael, who oversees emerging mobility programs at the Austin Transportation Department, describes as ""iterative approaches to things as we manage the next, say, 600 days."" There are now four companies back on the street, along with Revel's shared mopeds, which are just now starting to see consistent use. But JonMichael echoes Laborde when he says that, even in this challenging environment, ""We're experiencing a renaissance around personal mobility."" It's not hard to see why. The fear of contagion may have forced many back into the safety of their cars, driving alone – but knowing that this was unaffordable, inefficient, and environmentally catastrophic in the long run. Transit would need time to adapt to the new realities, which can happen here as it did in Asia after the SARS epidemic. JonMichael says, ""There's not an aversion to transit if it's properly administering safety protocols for current conditions,"" which has been part of Capital Metro's game plan for restoring ridership after being forced to plead with its customers to stay home even as it suspended fare collection. In this next normal, riding a scooter (or a bicycle, or just walking) seems less like a hip and fun way to recreate and more like a safer utilitarian alternative for trips one needs to take. But finding a scooter in April or May for that essential trip could have been dicey. However, an electric bike from Austin B-Cycle – one of 200 deployed by the community bikeshare in anticipation of SXSW – was waiting right there, along with its fleet of pedal-powered units. Suddenly, the seemingly dowdy and obsolete B-Cycle station-based model, threatened with extinction by the dockless onslaught, was exactly right for the moment: orderly, easy to find, and easy to sanitize. Accordingly, even as the dockless market went into hibernation, B-Cycle picked up the slack – as of May 1, its ridership exceeded its May 2019 numbers and continued to surge thereafter. JonMichael, whose port­folio includes the city-owned bikeshare (it's operated by the nonprofit Bike Share of Austin), attributes its rebound to the e-bikes, which he says get used about four times as often as a pedal-powered B-Cycle and for trips that are twice as long. The unexpectedly strong performance led the city and Capital Metro to accelerate their partnership plan to include B-Cycle (to be rebranded MetroBike) as one of the transit authority's services. Those longer trips were also seen on scooters as they slowly returned to the streets – a reflection of ""health workers, shift workers, essential workers using micromobility,"" JonMichael says. The average pre-COVID scooter trip in Austin was 1 mile; the average for June, which saw at least 40,000 trips, was nearly 2 miles, which was down from May's peak of 2.32 miles. Bird offered discounted and free rides to health care workers during this time, as well as featuring open restaurants in its app and working with the city on curb management for the next normal of takeout and delivery. ""We really have a great opportunity here,"" Laborde told us back in May. ""There's never been a better time to discuss how we're really going to get to 50/50,"" the mode-share target of the Austin Strategic Mobility Plan, with half of all commutes being made by means other than driving alone by 2035. ""We hope we can build on existing micromobility programs and invest in the infrastructure we need"" – that being transit – ""and continue to work with local businesses [as] part of the economic recovery."" Ever since the scooters came to town in 2018, Austin has tried to set itself apart as a test bed for innovation, in partnership with the industry and alongside the full array of emerging modes and technologies that Jon Michael keeps ATD's eyes on. ""Two years ago, people were moving around the city in different ways than before, and now it's changing yet again,"" he told us. ""It'll go through bumps and starts as we try to reopen, move forward and then pull back, and that will be the next normal. The best thing we can do is keep as many services operating as possible, and keep as much data as we can to help those companies understand where they can get riders or help enable the trips we have.""",https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2020-07-10/what-are-the-next-normals-for-scooters-in-austin/
Bird brings fleet of rentable electric scooters to Baltimore,Baltimore Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Baltimore, MD",2018,6,28,"Bird brings fleet of rentable electric scooters to Baltimore. A fleet of about 60 rentable, dockless electric scooters arrived in downtown Baltimore Thursday morning. Bird's battery-powered scooters cost $1 to start each ride, plus an additional 15 cents per minute. They can run up to 15 miles per day. Users can find the scooters through a mobile app. The fleet can currently be found around the Inner Harbor and Fells Point, with plans to expand to other neighborhoods as ridership increases. The Santa Monica, California, scooter-sharing company launched in September by Travis VanderZanden, a veteran executive of ride-sharing giants Lyft and Uber. Its scooters have been making their way into heavy-traffic cities nationwide. In a news release, Bird said there is an ""urgent need for additional transit options"" in Baltimore. The company said the scooters fill a void for people making trips across the city ""that are too long to walk, but too short to drive."" ""As summer heats up, Bird offers a convenient alternative to sitting in traffic or sweating through a walk or bike ride,"" the company said in a statement. It also pointed out that more than a third of cars trips in the U.S. are less than two miles long. ""Bird's mission is to replace these trips — get people out of their cars, reduce traffic and congestion, and cut carbon emissions."" Bird has deployed its scooters in more than a dozen cities across the country, including in nearby Virginia and Washington, D.C. But in some places, Bird has been met with pushback from local governments, including claims it released its scooter fleets without an official OK from local government officials. For example, WTOP reported this week that Bird deployed a fleet of scooters in Arlington, Virginia, without securing any kind of official arrangement with the county. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports the city's deputy attorney requested that Bird remove the 100 scooters it released in the area this week, saying it was not legal to operate the scooters on city streets or sidewalks. Bird was also temporarily ousted in San Francisco, along with competitor e-scooter companies Lime and Spin. According to reports from the San Francisco Chronicle, the city made the companies halt their rental operations and take hundreds of the electric scooters off city streets, while they apply for permits. Representatives from the Baltimore City Council did not immediately respond to request for comment Thursday on whether the city was aware of Bird's deployment in the harbor. A Bird spokesperson said the company ""submitted the necessary paperwork to operate as a business in Baltimore"" and aims to work closely with all of the cities in which it operates. Baltimore has had challenges in the past with rentable transportation options. The city's bike share program, which launched in October 2016, was temporarily shut down last year due to theft and vandalism problems that left most of the more than 400 available bikes out of commission. Bird does operate a little differently than bike share, though. The company says it will pick up its GPS-enabled scooters every evening starting at sunset, for charging and necessary repairs. Then Bird will redeploy them each morning at 7 a.m. at designated ""nest"" areas. Riders must have a valid driver’s license and be older than 18 to rent a scooter.",https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2018/06/28/bird-brings-fleet-of-rentable-electric-scooters.html
Bird electric scooters have landed in Baltimore. Now the city is trying to figure out how to regulate them.,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2018,7,23,"Bird electric scooters have landed in Baltimore. Now the city is trying to figure out how to regulate them. A new flock of Birds has descended on Baltimore. They’re scattered across sidewalks, propped up against buildings, and gliding through downtown streets. Since their arrival just weeks ago, the more than 60 dockless, battery-powered scooters have become fixtures in the city. California-based Bird, founded last year by a former executive with the rideshare platforms Uber and Lyft, is part of the latest wave of transportation startups transforming the way people get around in urban areas — and challenging local governments to create new regulations. Baltimore officials are now scrambling to establish rules for a company that has been in the city for only three weeks. “The city is in a bit of a spot because this is how Bird behaves,” said City Councilman Zeke Cohen, whose Southeast Baltimore district is now dotted with the standup scooters. “From my understanding, in many of the cities they are in, they essentially drop their scooters off and then the cities develop a regulatory framework. “It’s not a great way to do business.” Bird, based in Santa Monica, Calif., did not respond to a request to comment on Cohen’s criticism. City transportation spokesman German Vigil said the company has not been authorized to operate the city, but is not operating illegally. Bird has placed scooters in 18 cities in its first year of business. Some, including San Francisco and Salt Lake City, have banned the scooters temporarily to allow officials to develop guidelines for their operation. Milwaukee filed a lawsuit this month alleging that Bird has refused to suspend operations in the city, and has started to slap $98 fines on people who use the scooters. Baltimore transportation spokeswoman Kathy Dominick said the city was not involved in the rollout of Bird scooters here. “We are working with the Mayor’s Bicycle Advisory Committee and several other stakeholders to ensure that we provide provisions to help companies like Bird operate within the law in the City of Baltimore,” she said. Until rules are established, she said, “citizens who rent the scooters should be aware that they are riding at their own risk.” Bird bills itself as a “last mile” scooter rental service, offering a solution for traveling routes that are too short to drive but too long to walk. The machines can be rented, using a mobile app, for $1 to start plus 15 cents a minute. Drew Bassini, 23, works for Morgan Stanley in Harbor East. “I’m on my lunch break so, as opposed to walking or riding my bike, it’s preferable to get there quickly and not expend too much energy,” he said. “A scooter can get me from point A to B quicker.” The shiny new scooters have quickly proved a popular mode of transport downtown. Jeremy Collins, 23, said he now sees more scooters than bikes. “I think it’s great and much needed, especially for a city trying to rebrand as a world-class city,” Collins said. “Baltimore really needs to work on mobility and getting around, and the scooters offer a low-cost, easy-to-use way of doing that.” Liz Cornish, executive director of Bikemore, said the advocacy group has been in talks with city officials about dockless vehicle policy for months, but the timeline for establishing rules is unclear. “The reality is, the bureaucracy of policy formation happens right now at a much slower pace than these companies can deploy fleets [of vehicles] in cities,” Cornish said. Cornish said Bikemore supports the new form of microtransit — small-scale, on-demand vehicles that enable people to move through the city quickly and affordably. The popularity of dockless vehicles comes on the heels of the growth of bikeshare programs nationwide. Bikeshare ridership increased 25 percent in 2017, according to the National Association of City Transport Officials. Forty-four percent of bicycles in bikeshare programs were dockless. Uber and Lyft have announced plans to rent electric bikes and scooters through their apps. Bicyclists in Maryland are not permitted to ride on sidewalks, but there is no state or city law that prohibits scooters on sidewalks. Some motorists and pedestrians have expressed concerns for safety. Rosalind Heid said she was almost hit by a scooter on the sidewalk on Pratt Street. “My concern is, if I get hurt by one of these things, who pays the medical bill?” the retired railroad employee said. “It scares me they’re every place, it scares me they’re all over the sidewalk, it scares me they may hurt or kill somebody.” Giovanna Blatterman said the scooters are a burden. She said users frequently leave scooters strewn in front of her son’s Little Italy restaurant, Cafe Gia. “I was livid because they had pushed my flowers out of the way,” she said. “They were intruding into the passageway. “People say they are good for business, but throwing stuff in front of your business is not good for business for me.” Bird advises riders to leave the scooters near bike racks when they’re done, but that doesn’t always happen. The company tells users to wear helmets and stay off sidewalks, but those rules are difficult to enforce without city regulations to back them up. In Harbor East last week, first-time rider Jonathan Menges, 23, and his sister, Lauren, 18, zipped across the street and onto the red-bricked sidewalk without helmets. “I’ve seen enough people ride without helmets,” Jonathan said. Bird offers helmets free to riders, but charges shipping and handling.The company says it has distributed nearly 40,000 helmets. Bird pays local “chargers” from $5 to $20 per scooter to collect them off the street, take them home and charge them for the next day of use. Vigil, the city transportation spokesman, said officials “see the principle in how these scooters can help.” “We’re looking into how we can ensure the safety of residents and make sure we’re able to establish guidelines and rules for programs like this.”",https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-bird-scooter-safety-20180716-story.html
Unregulated Bird scooters have Baltimore City Council concerned,WBALTV,NBC,"Baltimore, MD",2018,7,31,"Unregulated Bird scooters have Baltimore City Council concerned. Baltimore is home to the Ravens and Orioles, and now there are some new birds in town. The company Bird has placed dozens of dockless electric scooters throughout the city without approval, which is raising concerns for some city officials. The scooter rental service runs through an app that shows where scooters are located in the city on a map. Participants pay through the app, which turns on the scooter. Some officials are concerned because the city had no idea Bird was coming to town. ""They're convenient. I've been in town for just a few hours and they've helped me get around pretty quickly,"" said user Kyle Johnson. Bird's goal is to solve the ""last mile problem"" by reducing car trips under two miles. ""I took an Uber down here from the airport, but this was just faster to pick up,"" Johnson said. The Department of Transportation was not involved with the rollout. In a statement a DOT spokesperson, ""we are working with the mayor's Bicycle Advisory Committee and several other stakeholders to ensure that we provide provisions to help companies like Bird operate within the law in the City of Baltimore.""

Riders should follow all traffic rules and use caution at crosswalks. Users are encouraged to wear helmets and avoid riding on sidewalks.

The DOT isn't aware of any accidents, but warns people who rent the scooters that they are riding at their own risk. Liz Cornish, executive director of Bikemore, said the nonprofit has encouraged the city to develop a pilot program for dockless bikes and scooters that ""formalizes the presence of these companies in Baltimore and holds them accountable to best practices in dockless vehicle share, including appropriate parking, open data and equity in placement.""

Baltimore is ending the Bike Share program and replacing it with a new dockless pilot program, the mayor and city transportation officials announced Wednesday. The city's new dockless pilot program will be in partnership with Lime, a bike and scooter startup, and with Bird, an electric scooter startup. The Baltimore Department of Transportation is initially partnering with Lime and Bird to provide access to both dockless bikes and scooters, including electric-assist bikes and scooters. It is meant to be an accessible transportation alternative for individuals of any income. ""This pilot will ensure that vendors that agreed to participate will need to place bikes and scooters in neighborhoods where 40 percent of the households make $25,000 or less a year,"" said Liz Cornish, executive director for Bikemore. Unlike the Bike Share bikes, the Bird and Lime scooters can be left anywhere in the city. During the pilot program, DOT officials will assess and evaluate the effectiveness of a dockless program and will advise on the development of regulations. Transportation officials admitted they do expect some vandalism to the scooters, like they saw with the bikes in the Bike Share program, but said it won't deter them. ""If anything, there's going to be a few things that make it damaged for one reason or another, but they're here because they know they can operate here,"" said Michelle Pourciau, director of Baltimore Transportation. In ending the Bike Share program, the DOT said in a statement that ""the current bike share program is not able to meet the growing demand for rental bikes."" The city is ending its contract with Bewegen and is ceasing operations Wednesday. The bikes will be removed by Friday. Residents who bought Baltimore Bike Share memberships should call the DOT at 410-396-6802 by Sept. 30 for refund information.

Lime rolls out 400 electric scooters in Baltimore this weekend,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2018,8,31,"Lime rolls out 400 electric scooters in Baltimore this weekend. Hundreds more electric scooters will appear on Baltimore city streets beginning this weekend, when Lime drops off a fleet of the dockless vehicles. The company is deploying 400 rechargeable scooters around the city starting tomorrow, spokeswoman Emma Green said Friday. The company will bring “hundreds of scooters over the next few days” and add more “gradually” thereafter. Lime joins Bird as a partner with the city in a six-month pilot program. Each company is paying the city $15,000 to bring up to 1,000 scooters here, under an agreement approved by Baltimore’s spending board last week. The rate is the same for both services: $1 to unlock a scooter and 15 cents per minute of riding. Lime is also permitted to bring up to 1,000 regular and electrically assisted bikes to Baltimore. Bird arrived quietly earlier this year, and announced in June that it had dropped off around 70 of its rechargeable scooters in the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. The company hasn’t responded to an email asking about the current fleet size in Baltimore. A Lime user must be 18 years old, have a driver’s license and bring a helmet to ride, the company says. The Lime app helps riders track down, unlock an available scooter or bike and officially end the ride. Like Bird, Lime is banking on good faith that each user will “responsibly park” the bike or scooter “by the street curb, or at a bike rack” after a ride, according to a release. Baltimore joins more than 80 markets around the country with Lime bikes and scooters. The company launched in June of 2017 and surpassed six million rides within a year. “We are confident that this new partnership with Lime will enhance transportation options to a great many more citizens across our city,” city Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau said in a statement. As part of the deal with the city, both Bird and Lime are required to deploy bikes and scooters in areas where 40 percent of households earn less than $25,000 annually. The scooters double as potential side hustle for motivated souls willing to round up the scooters, “juice” (or recharge) them overnight and drop them off for riders on city streets bright and early the next day.

Lime and Bird agreed to a pilot program with Baltimore City Department of Transportation (DOT) last month. Each company must pay the City $15,000 to operate. Both companies are allowed to bring up to 1,000 scooters to Baltimore and Lime can bring an additional 1,000 bicycles. Scooters must also be placed in low income neighborhoods. “Lime is thrilled to bring dock-free smart mobility options to Baltimore, and we applaud the City for moving quickly on a pilot program that can greatly improve the connectivity in and around the city,” said Maggie Gendron, Lime’s director of strategic development, in a statement. “We hope the fees Lime is paying to the City to participate in the program will help the City move towards more accessible and equitable mobility options, including increased and protected bike lanes.” “We are confident that this new partnership with Lime will enhance transportation options to a great many more citizens across our city,” Baltimore City Department of Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau said in a statement. Bird initially started out with 60 scooters before the pilot program agreement with DOT. Many additional Bird scooters were dropped off in recent weeks. Lime and Bird are a new chapter for Baltimore transportation as Baltimore Bike Share recently ended after less than two years. DOT invested $3.2 million into the program. Baltimore Bike Share was a partnership between DOT and Québec’s Bewegen Technologies, and was maintained by Baltimore company Corps Logistic. Baltimore Bike Share was plagued by theft and an abundance of bikes in need of repair. The South Baltimore Peninsula had five Baltimore Bike Share docking stations, four of which replaced on-street parking spaces. Those stations will be removed. Other stations in South Baltimore included Camden Yards, Baltimore Visitor Center at the Inner Harbor, University of Maryland BioPark, and Hollins Market.",https://www.southbmore.com/2018/09/04/lime-scooters-now-available-for-rent-in-baltimore/

""Lime is dedicated to responsibly sharing data with cities and does so with every city in which it operates,” Mullhauser said in an emailed statement. City Department of Transportation officials presented limited information on the scooter program Tuesday morning during a presentation to Baltimore Transit Choices, a coalition of transit supporters including businesses, universities, environmental and community groups, and others. The DOT presented the following data, combining information from both companies: » 250,544 total rides » 84,266 unique rides » 324,534 total miles ridden » 800-1400 scooters on the streets German Vigil, a department spokesman, declined to provide a breakdown of each vendor’s reporting, citing confidentiality concerns. City Solicitor Andre M. Davis said the city signed no confidentiality agreement with the companies. But the city Law Department is conducting a review of the available information, Vigil said, to determine what might be categorized as commercially confidential. Each scooter is being ridden between three and eight times per day, Warfield said, an indication that appetite exists for the scooters in the city. He described the relationship between the city and the scooter vendors as “positive — other than needing to work out the concern around getting the data to us.” City officials expect to bring up the issue during a call with the companies Wednesday, he said. The pilot agreements with Bird and Lime require the companies to provide weekly reports with the following: » the number of scooters in service » the number of rides » “anonymized origin/destination data in map form” (Bird stipulated in its agreement that this would remain confidential) » a point-map of the scooters’ location one day and one night each week » any scooter crashes » any requests to rebalance the fleet by customers or the Department of Transportation » a summary of any incidents of theft or vandalism, “and the information needed to access any police reports filed in the past week” » daily average location of the scooters Aside from stipulating that Bird’s origin/destination map would remain private, the city’s agreement with the companies did not label any of the other items as confidential. “We did a presentation this morning about the importance of scooters and our pilot program in Baltimore,” DOT spokesman German Vigil said in an email Tuesday. “As for the reports, we are working with our Law Department to get clarification on what we can share.”",https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-bird-lime-data-20181016-story.html
"Bird and Lime scooters lead to bumps, bruises and broken bones for Baltimore riders",Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2018,10,30,"Bird and Lime scooters lead to bumps, bruises and broken bones for Baltimore riders. Whisking along on an electric scooter headed to a concert in the Inner Harbor last month, Alex Martin hit an uneven space in the sidewalk and toppled over, landing hard on his right wrist. After wearing a cast for several weeks, the 23-year-old Federal Hill resident is now scheduled for surgery to fix a broken bone and a possible torn ligament. And he’s over the scooter craze. “I don’t think I will be riding in the city again,” he said. The electric Bird and Lime scooters have become wildly popular since they hit Baltimore streets, with people taking more than a quarter of a million rides in the first month and a half of the pilot program. But some riders are discovering they can be hazardous. It is hard to tell exactly how many people are wiping out and getting hurt because there is no good way now to track accidents. The scooter companies are supposed to report injuries to the city, but have yet to. City transportation officials said many people might not tell the company if they are hurt while riding, so accidents may never get recorded. The scooter companies require people to report accidents to the local police, but many might not. [Most read] Maryland adds 431 coronavirus cases, 9 deaths; Hopkins' positivity nearly double state’s rate » Hospitals also aren’t officially recording the number of injuries, but some emergency room and orthopedic doctors said they have started to see a surge since the scooters came to town. Patients are showing up with broken bones, bad bruises and scrapes. Some complain about concussion symptoms like headaches, dizziness and feeling dazed after a crash. “We have had a whole bunch of injuries,” said Dr. Babar Shafiq, a Johns Hopkins Hospital orthopedic trauma surgeon. “Most of them are ankles and knees. Both fractures and dislocations.” Most of the patients he has seen have bungled the dismount. Riders clip a pothole or try to avoid hitting something in their pathway and can’t get off the scooter quickly enough. The scooters look fun and easy to ride, but take some skill, said Shafiq, who also has seen collarbone and elbow fractures. Dr. Brian J. Browne, who works in the emergency room at the University of Maryland Medical Center, said he and his colleagues have treated several patients injured while operating scooters, including a 70-year-old woman who was thrown off after hitting an uneven spot in the pavement. She broke her thumb, wrist and elbow, and suffered lacerations on her face. “The more people who are using them, the more problems that will show up,” said Browne, who is also a professor and chairman of the department of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “They look really great as they are zipping along. But people need to be cautious. They are really lightweight and hitting any small thing could throw you off.” [Most read] Mike Preston: Ravens' blowout loss to Chiefs the kind that scars teams for entire season | COMMENTARY » Lime and Bird tell people they should wear a helmet when they register to use the service on the companies’ apps. The companies do not provide the helmets and few people bring their own. The companies, which are responsible for operations of the scooter program, did not return several messages regarding injuries. Riders also must have a driver’s license and be 18 years of age. Lime warns riders not to perform stunts on the scooters, while Bird tells riders to keep both feet on the vehicle at all times. Riders are also told to be aware of road obstructions or uneven surfaces. When customers sign up they agree to a waiver absolving the companies of injury liability. Nya Dobbs wasn’t wearing a helmet when she hit a pothole in Federal Hill while riding for fun with a friend one Saturday afternoon last month. Video footage she got from a nearby apartment complex shows Dobbs speeding along when she is suddenly thrown off the scooter, landing on her left hip. She looks startled as she immediately jumps up and scrambles back onto the scooter. Doctors had to drain blood from a softball-sized hematoma from the hip of the 24-year-old athletic trainer who said she doesn’t plan on hopping back onto one of the scooters anytime soon. Yet she acknowledged that the scooter companies do warn users to ride safely and that she knows there is the potential for accidents. “I think it just comes with the territory,” Dobbs said. “Bird and Lime suggest wearing a helmet and other safety precautions when you sign up. Accidents happen. Riders just need to be aware of all their surroundings, which can get hard.” The city’s Department of Transportation is planning a social media campaign centered around how to ride dockless vehicles safely and trying to figure out better ways to monitor accidents and evaluate other areas of the program. The scooter program is a pilot that runs through February and changes could be made to the program if it becomes permanent. Cities around the country are grappling with the legalities of scooter programs and how to regulate them . It is unclear if the cities themselves could be liable for injuries sustained by residents. State law requires riders under 16 to wear helmets. “That is something that is also a question nationwide,” said Meg Young, Baltimore’s shared mobility coordinator. “Other cities are going through the court system to see who is responsible. … That is still a gray area.” Many jurisdictions have sued the companies to block them from putting scooters on their streets. A class action lawsuit filed in California goes after the companies for injuries sustained by people who have been hit by the scooters. Young said Baltimore’s program is widely popular and the city would like to see it work if it can be done so riders are safe. “We are just trying to make sure that we evaluate this program thoroughly,” she said. Shafiq, the orthopedic surgeon at Hopkins, said more data needs to be collected about the risks and dangers. Stronger warnings about the risk of injuries and how to prevent them are needed as well, he said. “I think people need to be warned about the risks and I don’t know if that can be fairly done until we know the data and what the risks are,” he said. Dr. Keith Segalman, a surgeon with The Curtis National Hand Center at MedStar Union Memorial Hospital who treated Martin, said riders should probably be wearing knee and wrist guards as well as helmets. He has seen wrist injuries because riders use their hands to brace themselves when they fall and hit the ground. “If you are moving that fast you should have on a helmet or other protective gear,” Segalman said. “You are not going not let your kid ride a bicycle as fast as they can without a helmet.”",https://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-scooter-injuries-20181026-story.html
What to know about the Lime scooter recall,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2018,11,12," What to know about the Lime scooter recall. Lime announced a global recall of one of the models of its electric scooters after concerns were raised that the scooters could break apart while in use. Lime — along with its competitor, Bird — entered into a partnership with Baltimore in August to place up to 1,000 scooters or electric bikes on the streets. Here’s what local riders need to know about the recall, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Which scooters are recalled? Scooters made by manufacturer Okai are the ones being recalled. Lime hasn’t said how many of that make of scooters are in its fleets, but it is removing them from all streets, according to The Post. What should you do if you see one on the street? For starters, don’t ride it. But it’s unclear whether the Okai scooters have any distinguishing branding features that would help a rider identify them. The scooters that broke were coming apart where the handle stem meets the deck; take a close look there for any cracking before you unlock one. (A quick exam is generally a good idea before riding any bike or scooter.) I thought the batteries were Lime’s problem… They were. This recall comes several weeks after the company acknowledged that it had pulled thousands of its scooters off the streets this summer after discovering that a small number of them may have been carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire, The Post reported. What has Lime said about this situation? ""Safety is Lime’s highest priority,” the company’s statement says. “The vast majority of Lime’s fleet is manufactured by other companies and decommissioned Okai scooters are being replaced with newer, more advanced scooters considered best in class for safety. We don’t anticipate any real service disruptions.”",https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-md-lime-recall-20181112-story.html
Baltimore police recover five electric scooters from depths of the Inner Harbor,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2018,11,14,"Baltimore police recover five electric scooters from depths of the Inner Harbor. At least five of the electric scooters that are now ubiquitous on Baltimore’s streets were sent to watery graves, according to the city police department. Detective Jeremy Silbert, a police spokesman, confirmed that five of the two-wheeled contraptions were hauled up Wednesday from the Inner Harbor. “Our Marine Unit and Dive Team are often called to help remove bulk items from the harbor,” Silbert said. The recovery operation was spotted by attorney Bill King when he was on his way to work. Three or four people were involved — one of them in a wetsuit — along with beeping and buzzing equipment. King said the scooters — and a wheelchair police also recovered — were “all covered in seaweed and stuff.” King, who shared pictures of the effort to a popular Facebook group, said at least one of the scooters was definitely a Bird, one of two brands being tested in Baltimore. A representative for Bird didn’t immediately respond to questions about the scooters found in the harbor, nor did a spokesperson for Lime, the other company. In August, the Los Angeles Times reported that scooters in Southern California had been subject to all kinds of abuse — including being “crammed into toilets, tossed off balconies and set on fire.”",https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-scooters-inner-harbor-20181114-story.html

Lime riders in Baltimore can soon locate a bike or scooter via Google Maps,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2018,12,13,"Lime riders in Baltimore can soon locate a bike or scooter via Google Maps. Through some coordination between a tech giant and a fast-growing scooter and bike sharing startup, Baltimore smartphone users will soon be able to find a rentable, bright green scooter or bike using Google Maps. Lime, one of two dockless ride sharing companies operating in pilot status in Baltimore at the moment, has linked up with Google to allow riders one of its vehicle via the transit tab in Google Maps (the same tab that shows users how to get somewhere using light rail, subway or bus). The collaboration will be similar to what Google Maps offers with Lyft or Uber, showing the estimated time of arrival and the cost to get there. But this will also show you the scooter or bike’s battery life and an estimate for how long it’ll take to reach the vehicle. According to this blog post from Google, tapping the Lime option will redirect your phone to the company’s app. It’ll also likely help the startup sign up more users, since those who aren’t already registered will be redirected to the App or Google Play store. For reference, Lime costs $1 to start a ride and 15 cents per minute thereafter, meaning a 30-minute trip (say, from Fishbowl HQ on The Avenue to the Inner Harbor) would cost about $5.50. Baltimore is one of 13 cities around the country where Lime and Google are rolling this out. The others include Austin, Dallas, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, San Diego, Oakland, San Antonio, San Jose, Scottsdale and Seattle, as well as Auckland, in New Zealand, and Brisbane, in Australia. Others are coming, according to the announcement. While Lime offers its vehicles for rent in more than 125 markets around the world, a spokesperson said the company picked Baltimore and the dozen other cities due to their particular popularity there. As Lisa Snowden-McCray reported for WYPR, the rentable scooters from Lime and its competitor, Bird, are widely used around the city, and not just confined to the Inner Harbor or the white L. (Mayor Catherine Pugh has also taken some joyrides on them outside City Hall.) The company has dropped off at least 400 scooters here—it said in a more recent release that the total will be 1,000, the maximum allowed in its contract with the city—as well as 250 electric-assisted bikes as of last weekend, giving the city its first dockless bike share option. Bird, which quietly left dozens of its black, white and red electric scooters here in June before also entering into a pilot agreement, is paying $15,000, plus a dollar per scooter per day to the city to be here. Lime has the same deal for its scooters, but in October, city officials approved a new arrangement allowing the company to pay a flat fee of $20 per bike. A DOT spokesman told Baltimore Fishbowl that change was carved out to allow for Lime “to sustainably operate” here. In emails obtained by The Sun, company officials had said the other arrangement was “not feasible” for them, financially. The pilot programs expire at the end of February. After that, DOT said it will evaluate the successes of both programs to develop regulations for dockless transit in Baltimore.",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/lime-riders-in-baltimore-can-soon-locate-a-bike-or-scooter-via-google-maps/
"Year in Review 2018: Despite scooters, gridlock continues in Baltimore",Baltimore Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Baltimore, MD",2018,12,20,"Year in Review 2018: Despite scooters, gridlock continues in Baltimore. One thing is clear as the year comes to an end: Baltimore still desperately needs a transformative transportation project. Baltimore's bus system showed statistical improvement, and the new electric scooters quickly became a popular mode of transportation. But bus ridership declined and congestion increased in downtown Baltimore. Questions about the future of the Charm City Circulator continue to persist and the city's infrastructure is in dire need of improvements. Bus systems and metro lines The Maryland Transit Administration celebrated the one-year anniversary of the BaltimoreLink system in June. A year after the Gov. Larry Hogan's $135 million overhaul went into effect, ridership was down almost 10 percent but on-time performance was up to 68 percent in May. Some transit advocates questioned changes the transit administration made to how it calculates its statistics. Many said BaltimoreLink has failed to be a ""game changer."" ""Baltimore still needs and deserves a transportation game-changer that rapidly and efficiently provides mobility, especially those living in disconnected or transit-dependent neighborhoods, to current and emerging job hubs to ensure that Baltimore is highly competitive and attractive for employers and employees alike,"" Donald C. Fry, CEO of the Greater Baltimore Committee, said in June. The MTA had to shut down the metro system for emergency repairs in February, bringing to light once again the need for a new public transportation system. On the positive side, the MTA unveiled two new mobile apps that make the system more modernized. One of the apps provides real-time GPS tracking of buses. The other app allows passengers to pay fares on their phones. The city's free bus system, the Charm City Circulator, faces more questions heading into 2019. A contract with longtime vendor, Transdev Services Inc., expired. The city sued Transdev in September alleging a breach of contract. The lawsuit claims Transdev overcharged the city more than $20 million. Transdev has called the lawsuit meritless. Meantime, RMA Worldwide Chauffeured Transportation, was selected as the new vendor. The transition between vendors led to a shortage of buses, causing significant delays. While service has ramped up, the Circulator is no longer synced to a mobile app so passengers do not know when the bus is coming. Traffic systems and ride sharing Outside of public transportation, motorists faced significant delays in downtown Baltimore in July when the city's transportation department adjusted the timing of traffic signals. The changes, while well-intentioned, created havoc. They were part of an effort to improve a traffic control system that has not been updated in a long time. A need for infrastructure upgrades was another part of the story. Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau called Baltimore a ""city in crisis"" when talking about the city's infrastructure. Speaking at a Greater Baltimore Committee event in October, she said the city remains without a transportation plan but hopes to have one ready in 2019. Recommended Career & Workplace TBJ reveals 2020 class of Corporate Philanthropy Awards winners (Gallery) Energy First Look: Inside CPS Energy's new headquarters Food & Lifestyle Biscuit Belly to open two or three Lexington restaurants by 2022 Pourciau also outlined the backlog of projects, including $170 million needed to upgrade the traffic signals and equipment. One of the most significant transportation-related changes in Baltimore was the end of the city's bike share program and the introduction of electric scooters. The city announced the end of its troubled bike share program in August and subsequently entered into a six-month pilot with scooter startup companies Lime and Bird. Bird's fleet made its first appearance in Baltimore in June. Lime introduced its first scooters in August and later made dockless bikes available in December. The scooters have been wildly popular but also ignited frustration with drivers and some pedestrians. The results of the city's pilot should become available in early 2019, while lawmakers could consider possible regulations. While the scooters are new innovation, they are not viewed by transportation advocates as a transformative project. Looking to the future Two possible transportation projects with big potential are slowly moving forward. Elon Musk's proposed Hyperloop unveiled a proposed route between Baltimore and Washington, but is still far away from becoming a reality. Another project, a magnetic levitating train that can travel up to 300 miles per hour, continued to work through its regulatory process. The Federal Railroad Administration narrowed its list of possible routes down to two choices that run next to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. In November, the developers of the maglev project announced they had eliminated Port Covington as a potential location for Baltimore's station. The developers are working toward completing a draft environmental impact statement in fall 2019.",https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2018/12/20/year-in-review-despite-scooters-gridlock-continues.html

"Among Injured E-Scooter Riders, Only 4 Percent Were Wearing Helmets",CBS Baltimore,CBS,"Baltimore, MD",2019,1,25,"Among Injured E-Scooter Riders, Only 4 Percent Were Wearing Helmets. Head injuries, fractures, cuts and bruises: Those are some of the injuries that more than 200 riders of electric scooters — and those who were accidentally hit by or tripped over them — experienced over a year in two hospitals in Southern California, according to a new study published Friday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open. The study found 249 people were seen following electric scooter accidents at the two emergency departments participating in the one-year study. The majority of the people injured — 92% — were riders themselves, and only 4% of riders wore helmets. But the group also included pedestrians who were struck by scooter riders or who stumbled over a discarded scooter. Dr. Tarak Trivedi, the lead author of the study, is an electric scooter rider himself. As a physician, he once took care of a patient with a dislocated shoulder following an electric scooter accident at the same intersection he crossed on his way to work. “If I were to have one of these injuries, I’d be out of commission for a while,” said Trivedi, an emergency medicine physician at the University of California, Los Angeles and a fellow with the National Clinician Scholars Program. So, he started keeping track of the types of e-scooter injuries coming into the ER. Forty percent of those injured experienced head injuries, 32% experienced fractures, and 27% had cuts, bruises and sprains. Most people were treated and released, but 15 required overnight stays in the hospital and two required admission to the intensive care unit. The research team also stationed itself at busy LA intersections, to find that of 193 e-scooter riders observed, 182 were not wearing a helmet. As an observational study in just two emergency rooms, the new research can’t establish a concrete risk of injury per ride. That makes it difficult to compare the dangers of riding electric scooters with those of motor vehicle accidents. In addition, electric scooter companies don’t typically release the number of customers or rides, to the public. “[The study] fails to take into account the sheer number of e-scooter trips taken — the number of injuries reported would amount to a fraction of one percent of the total number of e-scooter rides,” Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy at scooter company Bird, said in a statement. “Moreover, the report fails to put e-scooter injuries into context as they relate to the high number and severity of injuries and deaths caused by motorcycles and automobiles.” Bird and Lime, both leading electric scooter companies, expressed their commitment to rider and community safety. “That’s why every day we’re innovating on technology, infrastructure and education to set the standard for micromobility safety,” a Lime representative said in a statement to CNN. As an emergency room provider, Travedi realizes an expanding market for electric scooters inevitably means at least some injuries. He urges riders, companies and policy makers to take the risks seriously. “Of course there are going to be injuries,” Travedi said, “but we have to do everything we can to prevent them.”",https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/01/25/among-injured-e-scooter-riders-only-4-percent-were-wearing-helmets/
Baltimore officials to amend proposal that called for 30 days in jail for riding electric scooters too fast,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2019,1,28,"Baltimore officials to amend proposal that called for 30 days in jail for riding electric scooters too fast. The Baltimore Transportation Department said Monday it would amend legislation that could have exposed people who ride a rental scooter too fast or on some city sidewalks to a month in jail and a $1,000 fine. German Vigil, a spokesman for the department, said officials' intention is for riders to face $20 citations if they violate a set of proposed rules. He said they had never expected a scooter rider to face jail time. Vigil said the department would offer an amendment to the proposal ""to eliminate any possibility that criminal penalties could apply to a rider."" The criminal sanctions are included in legislation the department asked the City Council to consider regulating the companies that provide dockless rental bikes and the electric-powered scooters, which appeared last year on Baltimore's streets, and to impose rules of the road on riders. But Vigil said the department's intention had been for the criminal sanctions to apply to companies if they broke the rules that would apply to them. ""For a criminal penalty to be imposed, a court would need to find that a violation of the law was so egregious that a criminal penalty is deserved,"" he said. ""That situation was never expected to arise for a rider, but potentially might arise for a provider of a vehicle for hire."" Bird and Lime operate the scooters under a pilot program with the city and Lime has a fleet of rental bikes, too. There were as many as 1,400 of the scooters in Baltimore as of October, and in the first few months, users had taken some quarter of a million rides. The companies generally have taken the approach of offering the vehicles in U.S. cities and waiting for the authorities to catch up. The proposed law is Baltimore's response and it calls for strict rules on the scooters, backed by stiff penalties. Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau briefed council members Monday on the legislation at their working lunch. ""We've been working diligently to see what we've found from the pilot,"" Pourciau said. ""We know from the pilot, for the most part, it's providing a new form of mobility and it is very popular."" But advocates for alternatives to using cars to get around said they are concerned that the proposal puts too many limitations on the use of the scooters and bikes and focuses on penalizing riders, rather than on creating infrastructure, such as dedicated lanes, where they can be used safely. Councilman Ryan Dorsey said he was passed by a scooter user and a cyclist on the sidewalk while he spoke by phone about the proposal. ""They're not hurting anybody, and to relegate people to have to operate in an unsafe environment is immoral,"" Dorsey said. ""We should be actually committed to creating a safe environment."" Maggie Gendron, Lime's director of strategic development, said the company's research has found its users generally ride on sidewalks when they don't feel safe on the streets. She said the San Francisco-based company is encouraging a broader discussion of how cities design their transportation routes. Gendron said in general the company welcomes the proposed Baltimore law because it would allow it to make better plans. [More Maryland news] Police arrest more than 100 people in Ocean City during unauthorized ‘H2oi’ car rally » ""We want to know where do we set up a long-term warehouse and what staff are we hiring and how do we give them long-term security,"" she said. Bird spokesperson Mackenzie Long said: ""Bird has concerns regarding the City Council's proposed regulations of e-scooters, particularly regarding the proposal to criminalize rider behavior with overly severe consequences and the suggested fee structure. We were pleased to learn that Department of Transportation has already said they will amend the proposal to eliminate the overcriminalization of e-scooters, and we hope they will similarly revisit the proposed fees. We are working with City Council and the Department of Transportation and we hope to help define a framework that can best serve everyone in the community."" The scooters and electric bikes cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute to ride. The legislation would put the cost of regulating the scooters onto the companies that operate them, in the form of fees, and would impose a 10-cent per ride tax. It also would give traffic enforcement officers the power to seize scooters that have been improperly parked. Riders, meanwhile, would have to be at least 16 years old and ride in the street on roads that have a speed limit of 30 mph or less. Scooters and e-bikes would be subject to a 15-mph speed limit. On roads with higher speed limits, riders would be allowed on the sidewalk, but would face a 6-mph speed limit. [More Maryland news] Howard County Baseball All-Decade » Riders would be required to use lights at night, but the law does not call for any other safety gear, such as helmets or pads. Baltimore's proposal also would require the transportation director to ensure equitable access to the scooters and bikes by people throughout the city. The proposed law says the violation of any of its provisions or rules subsequently imposed by the Transportation Department would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. But it also includes a provision for $20 civil citations in cases where the rules for using or parking the vehicles are broken — and it's that provision Vigil said officials intended to apply to riders. Violating the city's bicycle laws — which ban riding on the sidewalk — is already a misdemeanor, but carries a fine of just $10. The potential for criminal penalties in the dockless vehicles legislation worried activists. David Rocah, an attorney with the ACLU of Maryland, said that even without criminal penalties, conflicts between rules for electronic bikes and scooters and those for regular bicycles could lead to racial disparities in enforcement. ""The more confusing the rules you're writing, the more opportunity for police intervention and the more potential for disparities in the ways the rules are enforced,"" Rocah said. Vigil said the proposed rules are different because scooter riders are more exposed than those on bicycles. He did not address a question about battery-powered bikes. The scooters quickly gained a sense of ubiquity in Baltimore, but the proposed law would allow far more of them on city streets. Currently, operators are capped at 1,000 each. The proposal would permit a total of 12,000 scooters and dockless bikes. Cities and states around the country are working to set rules for the scooters and bikes. In November, officials in Washington, D.C., announced an alternative approach to dealing with speeding scooters and electric bikes. Companies that want to operate in the District of Columbia are being required to cap scooters' speed at 10 mph and that of electric bikes at 20 mph. In New York, Mayor Bill De Blasio has called battery-powered bikes a danger and police launched a crackdown in which hundreds were seized. But delivery drivers, many of them immigrants, rely on the bikes to get food to their customers. Jed Weeks, the policy director for cycling advocacy organization Bikemore, said he was concerned that the Baltimore proposal would spell out too much in difficult-to-change laws rather than giving city officials the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing technologies.

"Official who oversaw scooter pilot program leaving Baltimore DOT, citing 'bullying, intimidation, and outright harassment'",Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2019,1,29,"Official who oversaw scooter pilot program leaving Baltimore DOT, citing 'bullying, intimidation, and outright harassment'. The official who oversaw Baltimore’s dockless electric scooter pilot program and the shutdown of its bike share program has resigned from the city Department of Transportation, citing “bullying, intimidation, and outright harassment, originating from the highest level of leadership.” Matt Warfield announced his resignation before Monday’s rollout of a controversial draft bill to codify rules for scooters that included criminalizing improper riding with a $1,000 fine and a month in jail. After being roundly criticized, those criminal penalties were quickly removed from of the bill. Warfield, who was not involved in writing the proposed law, declined to comment Wednesday about his resignation. But in his Jan. 9 resignation letter, obtained by The Baltimore Sun, he attributed it to the Transportation Department’s leadership. Warfield, who was not involved in writing the proposed law, declined to comment Wednesday about his resignation. But in his Jan. 9 resignation letter, obtained by The Baltimore Sun, he attributed it to the Transportation Department’s leadership. In a statement in response Tuesday evening, Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau called Warfield’s departure a personnel matter but said the department “require[s] and insist[s] on respect for every individual working to ensure that our City's transportation improvements reflect a truly 21st century city.” ""I regret that this employee with the Department of Transportation concluded that his contributions have not been sufficiently appreciated,” the director said in a statement. “We will, of course, assess the issues that this employee has raised and where we can make improvements, we will. In the meantime, I wish him only the very best in his future endeavors."" A spokesman for Mayor Catherine Pugh did not respond to a request for comment. Warfield is moving to Boston for a job as a new mobility planner for the Boston Transportation Department, and his resignation is effective Friday. [More Maryland news] Howard County Baseball All-Decade » “We’re working to find the person to replace him,” Baltimore DOT spokesman German Vigil said. “Matt is an extremely important piece to our agency. We wish him well, and we hope to find a replacement to match his skills and abilities.” As the city’s top bicycle planner, Warfield oversaw the replacement of the beleaguered Baltimore Bike Share program with the pilot allowing Bird and Lime to place fleets of dockless scooters and bikes on city streets, and he pushed for the expansion of its Downtown Bicycle Network. He also navigated the fight between the Fire Department and bike-lane advocates over street-width requirements. Bicycling advocates praised Warfield’s efforts and raised concerns about the turnover of bike planners at the Department of Transportation. His resignation comes just over a year after his predecessor, Jay Decker, who oversaw the city’s bike share program, left for a job with the vendor of that program. Jon Laria, chairman of the Mayor’s Bicycle Advisory Commission, called Warfield “a terrific professional” who brought an urban planning background to his role. Warfield’s departure is “definitely a step in the wrong direction,” Laria said. Liz Cornish, president of Bikemore, said the advocacy group is disappointed to see the city transportation department lose another bicycle planner. “Matt Warfield did a lot of good work for the city and really helped advance bike infrastructure,” she said. “We hope DOT moves quickly to fill the vacancy so we don’t lose any of the momentum from Matt’s good work over the last couple of years.” His departure comes as the Department of Transportation proposed this week to significantly scale back its plans for separated bike lanes over the next few years. Under its 2017 Separated Lane Network Plan, the city had committed to building 77 miles of bike lanes by 2022. Instead, DOT officials told the Planning Commission on Thursday that they plan to build only 16 miles of bike lanes in that time — although they counted it as about 31 “lane miles,” or the distance in both directions. “We’re really far behind with this plan,” Pourciau told the commission. In its presentation, the department proposed to build fewer miles of new bicycle lanes over the next six years than the original plan had called for each year, said Jed Weeks, Bikemore’s policy director. Some of those miles, he noted, include adjustments to bike lanes that already exist, including those on Maryland Avenue and Potomac Street. “We’re planning to spend about $5 million to do that, when the plan called for $5 million alone in local funding to leverage $27 million [in grants and other outside funding] to build out the entire 77-mile plan,” Weeks said during public testimony. “We’re getting 16 miles instead of 77 miles.” Communication also has been a concern. The department’s botched scooter policy rollout on Monday could have been avoided, Laria said, if the Department of Transportation had allowed its Dockless Vehicle Committee to review the bill and give feedback, which was the purpose of creating the group. Despite the misstep, as well as Warfield’s departure, Laria remains bullish about the future of the Bird and Lime scooters in Baltimore. “I’m still confident we’re on a good path and we’ll come out of it with long-term dockless vehicle program that really could be one of the best in the country,” Laria said.",https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-warfield-leaving-city-dot-20190129-story.html
"Baltimore's dockless scooter pilot ends Thursday. Here's what the community thinks, and what's next.",Baltimore Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Baltimore, MD",2019,2,25,"Baltimore's dockless scooter pilot ends Thursday. Here's what the community thinks, and what's next. As Baltimore's dockless vehicle pilot program nears its end this week, city officials will need to decide if the Bird and Lime e-scooters and e-bikes that took the city by storm last summer will remain. A City Council bill has been proposed that would make the program permanent and give the Department of Transportation the power to issue permits to dockless vehicle providers, as well as set rules and regulations for those companies to follow. But Bill 19-0324 won't go before lawmakers before the six-month pilot program expires Thursday. Therefore, the city's spending board must vote to extend or terminate the pilot at Wednesday's Board of Estimates hearing as the bill makes its way through the council. If the extension is approved it would carry the pilot through April 30. Meg Young, who is coordinator for the program, has been collecting data on the program, tracking things like number of daily rides, where people are riding, who is using the new vehicles and what they are using them for. DOT released the results of a community survey early last week revealing many of those figures. The number of rides taken in the city per week ranged from 6,814 on the week of Jan. 14 to as high as 41,753 on the week of Sept. 30. At its peak, Young said Lime reported about seven rides per vehicle. ""One of the representatives from Lime said they were blown out of the water and considered it one of their most successful launches,"" she said. Young, who has been the shared mobility coordinator in DOT's Transit Bureau since October, hopes data from the survey, plus more she is pulling together into a larger report for City Council, will show why the program should become permanent. Nearly 5,300 people responded to the online questionnaire, with 81 percent saying they are in favor of continuing the program. Young said the level of response to the survey was unprecedented. It took off late last year when the department tweeted a link to it along with a photo of a nun riding a Lime scooter in Baltimore. DOT officials have also collected responses and data related to the program through partner organizations like Johns Hopkins, advocate organizations like Bikemore and a Dockless Vehicle Committee. The committee, which held open meetings throughout the pilot period, is made up of city employees, community members and others. Take a look at some of the data from the Community Mobility and Dockless Survey provided by the DOT below. The proposed City Council bill follows a national trend to issue permits to dockless vehicle providers instead of a request for proposals process like how the former Baltimore Bike Share Program was launched. Permits are a less rigorous process, allowing the market to stay competitive with more players, and would give DOT more flexibility to adjust rules and regulations as needed, Young said. As it is written, the bill does not get too specific about regulations beyond how and where the vehicles can be ridden and parked, and by whom. These specifications address concerns from some residents about teenagers riding the scooters and bikes in an inappropriate and sometimes dangerous manner. The bill says speeds must be kept under 15 mph and riders must be at least 16 years old. It also says scooters and bikes cannot be ridden on a road with a speed limit higher than 30 mph. A rider is permitted to use the sidewalk if the speed limit on the road is higher than 30 mph, but they must go no faster than 6 mph. It leaves decisions like how many vehicles each company can provide, and where in the city they should be made available, up to DOT. Currently, Lime and Bird are the only two providers and are each allowed to distribute up to 1,000 e-scooters and 1,000 e-bikes. Lime is the only provider with bikes, and both companies exceeded the cap at one point, Young said. From October to December the average number vehicles available daily from each company was 658. The number of available scooters and bikes, as well as the number of people riding them, varies from one day to the next depending on factors such as weather, Young said. Currently Baltimore collects funds from the program, totaling about $126,000 at the end of 2018, Young said. Dockless vehicle providers pay $15,000 to participate in the program, as well as $1 per scooter per day and a $20 flat fee for each bike. The new bill seeks to tax the companies only for the vehicles that are rented instead of the entire fleet. It would also include a permitting fee. Young is hopeful about the fledgling program and believes this style of ridesharing has become more successful than models like Baltimore Bike Share, which shut down last summer. She says it solves problems many people reported having with Bike Share, such as inconvenient station locations and the notion that riding a bike is more challenging than a scooter. There also appears to be significantly fewer issues with the dockless scooters and bikes being vandalized, damaged or stolen, than there was with the bike share program, Young said. She was unable to provide data on the number of damaged vehicles because Lime and Bird do not disclose it, but said officials at at least one company noted the problem is worse in other cities than it is in Baltimore. Young believes there is less animosity toward the scooters, perhaps because they are more evenly distributed throughout the city than the bikes were. She said ensuring equal access to the bikes is one of the DOT's top priorities with the dockless vehicle program. When the scooters and bikes are deployed in the morning, the program requires that 25 percent of the fleet be placed in underserved communities. Young said transportation department monitored that throughout the pilot period, and found the figure was closer to 22 percent in the mornings. By the evenings, however, about 28 percent of the fleet had ended up in the underserved communities, showing many people are using the vehicles to go home, Young said. ""It's a different model and it gets over challenges we had with the bike share,"" she said. ""And it is still meeting our goal to provide more efficient and sustainable transportation options.""",https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2019/02/25/baltimores-dockless-scooter-pilot-ends-thursday.html
DOT wants to extend pilot program for scooters as two new dockless companies come on board,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2019,2,26,"DOT wants to extend pilot program for scooters as two new dockless companies come on board. The Baltimore Department of Transportation is seeking to extend the pilot program for dockless vehicles into the spring, as two new companies plan to bring their electric rides to city streets. An item in the agenda for Wednesday’s Board of Estimates meeting calls for extending the plan through April 30, which has been agreed to by Bird and approved by the city’s law department. Subsequent items asks the approval to add dockless Spin scooters and dockless JUMP bicycles to the city’s fleet of rentable two-wheelers. Kathy Dominick, public relations officer for DOT, told Baltimore Fishbowl the new companies will enter the same agreement as Bird and Lime, paying a fee of $15,000 and $1 per vehicle per day. All the companies are limited to 1,000 vehicles per type. A spokesperson with Bird said the company is “thrilled” the pilot program has been extended. “We are encouraged with the progress we’ve made thus far in helping Baltimore replace short car trips with our emissions-free option,” the spokesperson said. “Bird hopes to remain a close partner to city officials and staff as they contemplate the long-term future of e-scooters for Baltimore.” Representatives from Lime did not immediately return a request for comment. As for the new entrants in the vehicle-sharing world, JUMP did not respond to a request for comment, while Spin replied, “We plan to launch next week with a small fleet.” Per TechCrunch, Spin started out as a bike-share company start-up but eventually added scooters and, later, decided to go all-in on them. Auto giant Ford bought the company late last year for close to $100 million, according to Axios. Like Lime, JUMP has both electronic-powered scooters and bicycles with electric-assist technology. That company was founded by the ride-sharing service Uber. The city is still grappling with how to regulate the scooters and bikes. Bird pretty much dropped its vehicles on city sidewalks last summer with little notice. Following the demise of the city-affiliated bike-share program operated by Bewegen, the city launched the pilot agreement with Bird and Lime. Draft legislation to regulate the rides was widely criticized for its harsh penalties, including a proposed 30-day jail sentence for breaking speed limits. A department official later told The Sun that DOT would amend the proposal. Dominick today told Baltimore Fishbowl the department will share a preview of the rules and regulations in its Pilot Evaluation Report.",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/dot-extends-pilot-program-for-scooters-as-two-new-dockless-companies-come-on-board/

Two new dockless electric scooter and bike vendors will arrive in Baltimore as early as next week, effectively doubling the number of providers in the city operating under the six-month pilot program. Spin, which is owned by Ford Motor Co., and Jump, owned by Uber, were given the green light to begin operating in Baltimore on Feb. 27. A representative from Spin confirmed the company's fleet of dockless e-scooterswill arrive in Baltimore mid-next week. A Jump representative was unable to provide a launch date, or say if the company will bring bikes, scooters or both to the city, but added that Jump is looking forward to ""working with the city of Baltimore to provide more transportation options."" The city's spending board approved the new companies along with a month-long extension of the pilot through April 30.

San Francisco-based Spin's orange and black scooters look similar to the Bird and Lime products already on the city's streets. They cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute of riding, the same as both Bird and Lime scooters, and can be activated through the free Spin app. The company already has a local presence on Towson University's campus where it launched a bike share partnership in February 2018. At Towson, the Spin bikes are returned daily to docking stations around the campus. A 30-minute ride starts at $1 and can be paid for through the app. Spin was acquired by Ford (NYSE: F) in November for between $80 million and $90 million, according to reports. Spin is in 12 cities and on seven campuses, its website shows. Jump was originally founded as Social Bicycles Inc. in New York City. The company has launched fleets of its red and black e-scooters and e-bikes in cities worldwide, including 17 in the U.S. Jump's scooters can be activated through the Uber app and also cost $1 to start and 15 cents per minute, but only after the first five minutes. The company's bike share program operates a little differently, and costs vary from one city to the next. Neither Jump nor Spin has included Baltimore on the list of cities it operates in yet.

The company will start with 80 scooters, placed in three locations: Cafe Jovial and 1100 Wico Mico in Washington Village/Pigtown, and the Dovecote Cafe in Reservoir Hill. Spin, which joins Bird and Lime in offering scooters in Baltimore, hopes to set itself apart by forging relationships with businesses and residents in the community — “asking for permission, not forgiveness,” said Dan Winston, the company’s general manager for the Baltimore, Washington and Northern Virginia region. “It’s a process that just starts with listening,” Winston said. “I’ve enjoyed stopping in local businesses, [saying] ‘Hi, we’re launching next week. What would you think about us putting some scooters outside your café?’” The company, which employs a full-time staff rather than freelance “chargers” as companies like Bird and Lime do, has identified Baltimore as a perfect market for its electric, rental scooters. “It’s a transit network that has challenges, some gaps, that don’t make a transit trip convenient,” Winston said. “Scooters can be a really important way to fill the gap in the ways we expect but also in the ways we don’t expect.” The city transportation department’s dockless scooter pilot program charges the companies $15,000 plus a dollar per scooter to place their fleets on the street.

"Council committee approves fees, fines, speed limits and other dockless scooter and bike rules",Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2019,3,20,"Council committee approves fees, fines, speed limits and other dockless scooter and bike rules. With about a month left in the city’s extended pilot program for dockless transit, a committee of city lawmakers today approved broad rules and regulations for the thousands of rentable bikes and scooters that have been dropped around town by Bird, Lime, Spin and, soon, Jump. The Land Use and Transportation Committee unanimously advanced legislation making the dockless program permanent and giving the Department of Transportation power to issue paid operating permits to bike and scooter companies. The bill would allow DOT to impose fines on users and providers, collect taxes on every ride, accumulate data from the private firms to track usage and more. Under the amended bill, the city would issue permits, rather than field requests for proposals, to dockless rental companies to operate in the city, which Department of Transportation Chief of Policy Theo Ngongang-Ouandji said is a more “competitive approach” to getting vendors. The city would tax every ride 10 cents, and keep a schedule of fines for users and the companies to follow. The only charges inherited by riders would be those small excises and a $20 infraction for unlawful operation or parking of a scooter or bike. What exactly does “unlawful operation” mean? More specific rules are forthcoming, but among the proposed ones: 15 mph speed limits for scooters and 20 mph limits for bikes and e-bikes; parking permitted on most sidewalks, and banned in driveways (without the owner’s permission), public streets, alleys and at most bus stops; no third-party advertising on vehicles; anyone younger than 16 must wear a helmet (most companies actually bar anyone younger than 18 from riding, but this rule would cover privately owned e-scooters and e-bikes); and riding is barred on sidewalks unless the adjacent road’s speed limit is at least 30 mph–and if they do opt for the sidewalk, the vehicle speed limit is 6 mph. That last regulation presented a sticking point today. Councilman Ryan Dorsey, a Complete Streets booster who noted he personally uses bikes, scooters and public transit to get around town, said cars typically travel at “lethal” speeds for pedestrians. And drivers know not to travel more than 12 mph over the speed limit or risk a fine from a traffic camera, so they often go 10 or 11 mph over to continue speeding without penalty, he said. “We are saying that you can ride on the sidewalk, but only on streets where cars are likely traveling 41 mph,” he said. Dorsey proposed an amendment to let riders take to the sidewalk if the nearby road has a limit of at least 25 mph. Councilman Eric Costello opposed it, however, saying it would “create an unsafe situation” for pedestrians on the sidewalk, and the committee ultimately voted 5-2 against the change, with only Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke supporting Dorsey’s amendment. The bill imposes steeper penalties on scooter and bike providers, with $1,000 fines for supplying more vehicles than permitted, failing to provide agreed-upon data to the city, not offering equitable access to vehicles and more, and $500 fines for not removing scooters and bikes from streets overnight—a task typically handled by often-competitive “juicers”—or failing to relocate scooters and bikes if DOT has notified the firm that they’re parked illegally. The version advanced today had a couple major changes from the original text, drawn up by DOT with input from stakeholders around the city. For one, it removed a cap that said six companies at most could operate in Baltimore, with a total of 12,000 vehicles allowed. It also added language to open a 30-day public comment period on regulations before they become law, and laid out those aforementioned fines, among other changes. Meg Young, shared mobility coordinator for DOT, said officials worked with DOT’s Dockless Vehicle Committee, council members, and scooter and bike companies to clarify language and follow national best practices. Ngongang-Ouandji said they also relied on feedback from a non-scientific, voluntary survey of scooter and bike users, which he said reached more than 5,000 respondents. He said 74 percent of respondents identified as white, 14 percent as black, 4 percent as Hispanic and the rest as “other,” and around 80 percent of those groups expressed support for making dockless transit a “permanent fixture.” (Dorsey, for his part, criticized the makeup of the respondent pool and of the Dockless Vehicle Committee, arguing that young, black riders hadn’t played enough of a part in shaping the policy.) Cycling advocacy group Bikemore, the Baltimore Development Corporation, the Law Department, Bird and more than a dozen city residents offered supportive testimony for the bill. “This has been an incredible success, this pilot,” Bikemore policy director Jed Weeks told lawmakers, adding, “I think this is really good legislation that the committee should feel good about passing out of committee.” The city has positioned itself to profit from its planned program. In a letter of support from the Department of Finance, officials anticipate between 1.38 million and 1.8 million rides annually. Finance estimated it would translate to $1,084,000 in revenue, split between permitting fees for the four companies (around $375,000), fines (around $550,000) and taxes on rides (another $159,000). Under the pilot program, the companies have paid the city a flat fee of $15,000 each, plus $1 per day per scooter and $20 per day per bike. Total revenue at the end of 2018 was around $126,000, Young previously said. Following today’s 7-0 committee vote, the bill is headed to a second reader vote from the full council at its next meeting on March 25.",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/council-committee-approves-fees-fines-speed-limits-and-other-dockless-scooter-and-bike-rules/
Scooter law — with threat of jail time stripped out — wins preliminary approval from Baltimore City Council,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2019,3,25,"Scooter law — with threat of jail time stripped out — wins preliminary approval from Baltimore City Council. The Baltimore City Council gave preliminary approval Monday to legislation that would set rules for dockless scooters and bicycles on city streets. The vote followed an earlier hiccup in the city Department of Transportation’s regulation proposal which, after a backlash, was amended to remove a $1,000 fine and jail time penalties for riders who violate the rules. People who speed on a scooter or park unlawfully would now face a $20 fine. The council advanced the bill with a unanimous voice vote. The legislation would require Bird, Lime, Spin, JUMP and any other companies that receive permits to operate fleets in the city to pay a 10-cent excise tax for each scooter or bicycle ride. “The agency’s worked hard and in good faith to get to a policy that’s going to work for the city,” said Lester Davis, deputy chief of staff to Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young. “We’re in a good place and we’re ready to get started.” The scooters have been allowed in Baltimore under a pilot program. The permanent rules, which would replace the pilot if they are adopted, similarly require the companies to provide “equitable access to dockless vehicles for hire throughout the city and in under-served areas,” the bill says. To receive a permit, the companies would be required to submit their names, documentation of insurance, an agreement to indemnify the city, a performance bond to cover any damage to city property or costs of removing and storing improperly parked equipment, and any other documentation requested by the city. Under the rules, the companies would face $1,000 penalties for a number of violations, including: having more vehicles than allowed, operating without a permit, failing to provide required data or reports, failing to notify the city of a data breach, displaying advertisements on the bikes or scooters, failing to maintain a 24-hour customer service phone support, failing to adhere to national safety standards, failing to provide equitable access and failing to comply with other requirements established by the city. Violations that could result in a $500 penalty include: failing to remove the dockless vehicles from streets between dusk and dawn, failing to ensure they are parked according to the rules and failing to move improperly parked scooters or bikes in a timely manner. Riders would face a $20 ticket if they ride too fast — more than 15 mph on a scooter and 20 mph on a bike using its electric motor — or ride on the sidewalk in some cases. [More Maryland news] Ocean City officials defend large-scale police response to ‘H20i’ car rally: ‘Ugly at times ... but the plan worked’ » The amendments also removed a proposed prohibition on riders under age 16 using the scooters or bikes. Now youngsters would be allowed to use them as long as they wear a helmet. Other specifics, such as the number of vehicles allowed, the age limits and other rules were removed to allow the Transportation Department to have discretion and oversight in the permitting process, which is easier to revise than a city ordinance, said Jed Weeks, policy director for Bikemore, the city’s bicycle advocacy group, which was involved in writing the regulations. “Everyone is open, even at an ordinance level, to continuing to evaluate and adjust,” Weeks said. “If we pass this law, and every company says we can’t operate under these circumstances, I’m sure we would adjust to reasonable complaints.” Bird, the first of the operators to place scooters on streets, had raised concerns that the threat of penalties would discourage its independent contractors from working for the company in Baltimore. Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke plans to add another amendment before the vote to ensure the penalties are levied on the companies, not their independent contractors. Councilman Ed Reisinger said Bird also bristled at the 10-cent-per-ride tax, which he said the company wanted reduced to 5 cents. He thought it was galling of the company to complain about the proposed regulations, given that it dropped the scooters on city streets last summer without asking permission. “If Bird don’t like the rules and regulations, they flew in and they can fly back out,” Reisinger said. “I don’t care.” Spokespeople for Bird, Lime and JUMP Bikes, which has not yet launched in Baltimore but has been permitted to do so, did not respond to requests for comment on the record. Dan Winston, Spin’s general manager for the Baltimore, Washington and Northern Virginia region, said the company appreciates the framework set up by the regulations, which “allows us to set up our business and our operation in a way that’s going to achieve the public goals.” “We think they are a good set of regulations,” Winston said.",https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-dockless-vehicle-bill-20190325-story.html
Bird doubles its per-minute rate for riding its scooters in Baltimore,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2019,4,8,"Bird doubles its per-minute rate for riding its scooters in Baltimore. With several weeks left in the city’s extended dockless transit pilot program, Santa Monica-based vendor Bird has roughly doubled its rate for riders in Baltimore. Previously $0.15 per minute, with a standard $1 fee to start, Bird has now raised its rate to $0.29 per minute, the app shows. In an email sent to Baltimore Fishbowl Tuesday afternoon, a Bird spokesperson said, “Similar to ride-hailing, big macs, and cups of coffee, our pricing now varies by city.” Prices now range from $0.10 to $0.33 per minute, the company said, albeit without explaining why. A spokesperson for the city’s Department of Transportation said the agency was “unaware” of the change, and referred to it as “a test of dynamic pricing in Baltimore.” “We are nearing the end of our Dockless Pilot Program, and remain committed to providing affordable, equitable and accessible transportation solutions,” DOT said. The statement noted other vendors’ prices have remained static, “so with multiple service providers, the public can select the appropriate dockless vehicle based on price, availability, or any other factors.” Bikemore policy director Jed Weeks and local commuter extraordinaire (and Baltimore Fishbowl contributor) Brian Seel shared word of the increase on Sunday. As Weeks and DOT noted, the rate remains $0.15 per minute for competitors Lime and Spin. Bird became the, erm, early bird, among scooter vendors to arrive in Baltimore in June of 2018 when the company dropped off a fleet overnight in the Inner Harbor and Fells Point. Lime followed, and the city launched its pilot program with both firms just as its more formal dock-based bike share program crumbled into pieces last summer. Both Bird and Lime paid the city $15,000 up front plus a $1 per vehicle per day, with caps on 1,000 of each type of vehicle (i.e. 1,000 scooters for Bird, 1,000 scooters and 1,000 bikes allowed for Lime). The scooters are now ubiquitous, and have proven popular across racial and geographic lines in the city. Other companies have also joined the fold with the pilot program still in effect. DOT welcomed in SPIN scooters and Jump bicycles in February and extended the pilot program through April 30, an announcement that a Bird spokesperson said the company was “thrilled” about. “Bird hopes to remain a close partner to city officials and staff as they contemplate the long-term future of e-scooters for Baltimore,” the company said in a statement to Baltimore Fishbowl on Feb. 27. Lawmakers and DOT have already drawn up preliminary rules for where and how scooters and dockless bikes can be used around the city—with no jail time for illicit use, fortunately—and the city council gave them preliminary approval last month. At a March council committee hearing about Baltimore’s proposed regulations, Bird’s senior manager of government affairs, Cameron Kilburg, asked lawmakers not to penalize companies for leaving scooters out after dark, and that the city impose a tax of $0.05 per ride instead of $0.10, among other changes. As originally written, the bill required firms to remove any vehicles from dusk to dawn. Lawmakers have since amended the legislation to let the director of DOT determine the hours when companies must remove scooters and bikes from sidewalks and streets, but are sticking with the planned excise of $0.10 per ride. The Department of Finance has estimated the city can bring in more than $1 million annually from a regulated dockless scooter and bike program, including $159,000 from ride taxes alone. Scooter riders in Detroit also found Bird had hiked rates this weekend, from $0.15 an hour to $0.31. In an earlier case from Raleigh, North Carolina, The News and Observer reported in January that the firm tacked on a $2 transportation fee per ride, on top of the $1 start fees and $0.15 per minute per ride. The changes came after city lawmakers approved regulations restricting when and where scooters could be parked and ridden, with a $300-per-scooter fee and 500-scooter limit for companies. Bird reportedly urged those who didn’t like the extra fees to voice their displeasure to the Raleigh City Council. Late last month, both Bird and competitor Lime announced they’d be pulling out of Raleigh, citing “burdensome” and “onerous” regulations. Five other dockless transit firms have applied to replace them. Baltimore hasn’t imposed nearly as stringent a cap, with a planned limit of 12,000 vehicles of each type–scooters, regular bikes and e-bikes–allowed in the city. More than 191,000 riders used dockless transit to travel 828,761 miles in total around Baltimore from mid-August of 2018 through January of this year, according to a pilot program evaluation report published by DOT last month.",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/bird-doubles-its-per-minute-rate-for-riding-its-scooters-in-baltimore/
Pilot Program For Uber’s JUMP Scooter Service Underway In Baltimore,CBS Baltimore,CBS,"Baltimore, MD",2019,4,14,"Pilot Program For Uber’s JUMP Scooter Service Underway In Baltimore. Uber has launched its own scooter service called JUMP and they have arrived in Charm City. JUMP joins many other popular scooter services in Baltimore including Bird, Lime and Spin. “They are so amazing,” Alessia Morisco, a visitor from Italy, said. “So fun. We can go everywhere with these.” There is 300 bright red, dockless JUMP scooters now rolling around Baltimore. “One interesting thing about JUMP is that they are partnered with Uber,” Meg Young, with the City Department of Transportation, said. “So if you already have the Uber app on your phone, you can now switch between choosing a ride or choosing to use a scooter or bike.” The JUMP scooters are part of an eight-month pilot program in Baltimore. If Baltimore City Council votes in favor of keeping the program, dockless bikes will also join the scooters in the streets. “Currently the pilot program is slated to go through April 30,” Young said. “City Council will actually vote on April 15, this coming Monday, to decide whether or not we will have a permanent program.” The phone linked scooters have been met with favorable opinions from many visitors. “If I have this in my city, every day I’m going with that,” Morisco said.

DOT Director Pourciau resigns as OIG looks into ‘morale’ of department,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2019,4,26,"DOT Director Pourciau resigns as OIG looks into ‘morale’ of department. Baltimore Department of Transportation Director Michelle Pourciau resigned today, four days after The Sun reported the Office of the Inspector General is looking into the operation of the transportation department, according to two people familiar with the matter. Lester Davis, spokesman for Ex Officio Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young, confirmed the news, and said senior advisor Frank Murphy will serve as acting director. Asked for comment, DOT spokesman German Vigil would only confirm Pourciau’s departure. City Councilman Ryan Dorsey released a statement calling Pourciau’s resignation “among the best things that could happen for Baltimore right now.” “Transportation is the deepest disparity Baltimore’s population faces, and the number one problem we face in terms of population loss and economic potential,” he said. DOT controls a third of land in the city, Dorsey noted. “The position requires visionary leadership that commands competent and efficient operations,” he said. “Director Pourciau exhibited none of the above as she stalled progress and created nothing but discontent through her two years.” In a statement, the cycling advocacy group Bikemore said both Pourciau and Mayor Catherine Pugh failed to live up to the “ethos of progressive transportation both claimed to embody.” “This lack of leadership has cost the City millions in lost grant dollars, resulted in poorly managed projects, led to the attrition of talented staff, and has sown deep distrust in communities,” the organization wrote. “When communities don’t trust DOT to do its job, it blocks all progress toward building a city connected with high quality transportation choices.” Dorsey told The Sun earlier this week that he’s spoken with three dozen people interviewed for the investigation and said he expects the report will find Pourciau proved to be a barrier to attracting and retaining top talent. “Professionals across the country have become significantly aware of how devastating this director has been to progress on transportation in Baltimore,” he said. “There is nobody I know of who believes this director is serving the city well.” Pourciau’s confirmation hearings in 2017 proved contentious when council members raised concerns about communication with the transportation department. Young, then serving as city council president, delayed the confirmation vote for a week so Pourciau could meet with council members to address any concerns. She was eventually approved unanimously. In her time at the helm of DOT, which per The Sun has a $207 million budget and more than 1,200 employees, there’s been contentious fights over bike lanes, the collapse of the city’s own docked bike share program and the arrival of dockless e-bikes and scooters furnished by start-up companies. During the spring of 2017, the city attempted to remove a bike lane on Potomac Street in Canton citing a rarely used fire code restriction that requires 20- and 26-foot street clearances for fire department vehicles. The cycling advocacy group Bikemore and two residents successfully sued the city to keep the lane. One year later, the council repealed that part of the fire code–without Pugh’s signature–and passed a Complete Streets law that would overhaul design guidelines to cater to pedestrians, cyclists and public transit over cars. Both measures were sponsored by Dorsey. Up in Roland Park, a similar bike lane battle has played out in recent years over a cycletrack on Roland Avenue, stretching from West Cold Spring Lane to West Northern Parkway. The lane was reconfigured in 2015 to place parked cars in between the lane for bicycles and the lane for vehicular traffic. Some residents complained this design created traffic outside of schools when parents went to pick up their children and caused damage to cars when cyclists hit them. The city last year launched a survey and held a public meeting to collect feedback on five options for re-working the lane. A “road diet” reducing a stretch of Roland Avenue to one lane to make more room for cyclists and parked cars was deemed the “preferred” option at the time and earned the most support in a non-scientific survey of locals. But DOT decided to ignore the results of the poll and delayed its decision, even though the department later teased an experiment with the road diet option. In one of her final acts as mayor before taking an indefinite leave of absence in the wake of the “Healthy Holly” scandal, Pugh ordered the lane to be removed. Curbside parking will be restored at an estimated cost between $600,00 and $750,000. Then there’s the matter of the bikes the city supplied to encourage ridership. A July 2018 investigation by Baltimore Fishbowl found the Baltimore Bike Share, which had closed once before in 2017 after problems with vandalism and theft, was due to fail again. Of the 500 bikes in the city’s fleet, only a handful were available, and among those, even fewer were able to be checked out, our reporter found. Some 200 were still waiting to be fixed at the maintenance facility run by Bewegen, the company that designed and installed the bike share system. That August, the city decided to scrap Bewegen’s $2.4 million bike share program and shift its focus to dockless e-scooters and bikes, some of which had quite literally been dropped off in the city without the knowledge of officials. DOT drew up a pilot program that permitted dockless companies to deploy 1,000 vehicles of each type. Those providers pay a fee of $15,000 and $1 per vehicle per day. In January, a draft proposal of regulations for scooters and e-bikes called for 30-day jail terms for riding too fast. Department officials amended the proposal so that riders would instead face $20 citations. Before the roll out, Matt Warfield, who oversaw the scooter pilot program and shut down Baltimore Bike Share, resigned, citing “a work environment of bullying, intimidation, and outright harassment, originating from the highest level of leadership,” The Sun reported at the time. His departure followed an exodus of four senior officials from the Department of Transportation in 2018.",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/dot-director-pourciau-resigns-as-oig-looks-into-morale-of-department/
Require helmets for scooter riders,Baltimore Sun,Tribune Publishing,"Baltimore, MD",2019,5,20,"Require helmets for scooter riders. Christopher Conti, the president of a Georgia-based fitness company, was killed in March after he crashed a rented electric scooter — like those littering the sidewalks of Baltimore — into a tree in San Diego. He, like most people riding such scooters, was not wearing a helmet. His death, and the thousands of other injuries reported throughout the country from using these devices, highlight a larger problem in the U.S.: Technology is out of step with safety. A recent CDC report found that for people involved in electric scooter crashes, 48 percent of injuries were head trauma. One out of every five injured riders had evidence of traumatic brain injury. Nearly half of the injured riders had a severe injury, such as bone fractures, severe bleeding or sustained organ damage, which means long hospital stays. This was similar to another study published recently in JAMA. The most common injuries were head injuries (40 percent), followed by fractures (32 percent). At least 1,545 injuries in the U.S. involved electric scooters over the past year. Sharing a helmet is a model that's been shown to work in other regions. In Melbourne, Australia, a bike-share company attaches a helmet to the bicycle for use while riding. Why can't this be done with e-scooters? If sharing a helmet isn't your thing, new helmet designs are easy to take with you. For example Swedish firm Hövding has one that looks like a neck warmer, but inflates into an airbag that cradles the head upon impact. These micromobility devices can certainly mitigate transportation challenges — such as congestion, emissions and access — for short trips to fill transit gaps. But we should make sure our riders are safe by adopting legislation that requires helmets and by working with industry to develop better options to prevent avoidable deaths and injuries. The CDC report also found that the majority of people injured from electric scooters were not wearing helmets — less than 1 percent. Why? They largely don't have to. In California, a helmet is required for riders under 18, and in Maryland, for those under 16. But most of the injured riders were between the ages of 18 and 29. Electric scooters have become increasingly popular since their initial pilot programs in 2017. They are eco-friendly and easy to use in urban contexts, replacing personal cars and ride-hailing options, according to a report from Portland, Ore. One out of three electric scooter users there said they chose scooters over other powered vehicle options; among tourists and visitors to the city, the figure was one in two. Another report released last month by the National Association of City Transportation Officials shows riders took 38.5 million trips on shared electric scooters in 2018, more than the 36.5 million trips on shared, docked bicycles. While injuries on other modes of transportation vastly outnumber those on scooters, there also many more cars, motorcycles and bikes on the streets, making comparison difficult. Simply put: every rider is vulnerable to head injury when using an electric scooter.",https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-op-0521-scooter-safety-20190520-story.html

Baltimore Opens Application Period For Dockless Vehicle Program,CBS Baltimore,CBS,"Baltimore, MD",2019,7,10,"Baltimore Opens Application Period For Dockless Vehicle Program. Companies hoping to operate dockless bicycles or electric scooters in Baltimore are now able to apply for the city’s dockless vehicle program, transportation department officials said Wednesday. Dockless vehicles, which have popped up in parts of the city in recent months, are equipped with GPS sensors and are available for rent using a smartphone. Unlike other vehicle-sharing programs, dockless vehicles do not have to be returned to a station after use. The city had previously held a six-month pilot and sought community feedback before launching the program. A number of people who responded to a city survey on dockless vehicles expressed safety concerns regarding their use as well as the potential for vandalism and lack of enforcement of rules. In the final rules for the program, companies will be required to install speed limiters on scooters preventing them from going faster than 15 miles per hour. Operators have until July 24 to apply for a permit, which will be good for one year beginning in August. Up to four companies will be given a permit. The department of transportation estimates the program will cost $280,000 in its first year, all of which will be covered by fees charged to the companies receiving a permit.",https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/07/10/electric-scooter-dockless-vehicle-program-baltimore-accepting-applications/
Here's the changes coming to Baltimore's dockless scooters as the pilot program ends,Baltimore Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Baltimore, MD",2019,7,11,"Here's the changes coming to Baltimore's dockless scooters as the pilot program ends. Dockless scooter and bike vendors such as Bird and Lime will now be able to apply for a one-year permit to deploy their vehicles across Baltimore City. The application period began Wednesday and formally kicks off the start of the city's new Dockless Vehicle Program, which was made official with the passing of a city council bill earlier this year. Residents and visitors may have already spied the electric scooters zipping around town, but with the end of the pilot program and launch of the application process, riders of the dockless vehicles are likely to see some changes in the coming months. Among them are the possibility for new vendors, the arrival of full fleets of bikes, a broader distribution of the vehicles, increased education about how to ride them and the creation of corrals for parking the vehicles. Vendors will have until July 24 to submit their applications, and if selected would be awarded a permit effective August 1 through July 31, 2020. Only four vendors will be chosen, meaning the application process will be highly competitive, said Meg Young, shared mobility coordinator for the city's Department of Transportation (DOT). It also means the vendors currently available in Baltimore under the existing pilot program — Bird, Lime, Jump and Spin — may not be the same come August. The vehicles have become increasingly popular among city residents and tourists since their launch last summer. Young said the scooters saw the highest ridership numbers to date with 48,000 rides the week of June 30. Here's how it works. The program will operate at no cost to the city as each of the four vendors will be charged $70,000 annually. The expenses and permit fees will cover the cost of staff, meetings with advisers, education materials, data storage and analysis, construction of shared mobility corrals and upgrades to bike lane infrastructure. The fee is in addition to a per ride tax of $.10 per scooter. Vendors must also pay $10,000 annually in performance bonds, meaning when applicable, the money would be used to cover any damage to public property or the removal of vehicles. In addition to paying fees, the companies will also be required to adhere to a number of rules and regulations. Young said they were designed in part to incentivize companies to deploy more than one type of vehicle. Bikes tend to be more expensive to maintain so fewer companies offer them over scooters, she explained. If a company operates only one type of vehicle, they can have between 150 and 1,000 in operation. If they expand that to two or more types, their cap increases to 2,000 total vehicles — however they are required to always have 150 of each type in operation and can be penalized if they fail to do so. Adaptive vehicles, such as a tricycle designed for an individual with balance issues, are not included in the total fleet numbers to encourage accessibility options, Young said. To ensure the vehicles are distributed across the city and not just in the downtown core, Young said the vendors will be required to deploy in specific zones. In addition to requiring a certain percent of the vendor's fleet be made available in each of the city's nine planning districts, DOT has identified 20 equity zones in low-income areas and public transit hubs where vehicles must be placed daily. A city employee will be hired to oversee a live data feed of the vehicles' locations to ensure deployment is functioning correctly. Lastly, the vendors, DOT and the Baltimore City Police Department will be launching a $30,000 to $40,000 education campaign to teach riders how to properly operate and park the vehicles. It includes having a presence at community events such as the upcoming Artscape festival, and creating flyers for police officers to hand out as a warning to those using the vehicles incorrectly. According to the permit application, the DOT will be looking for companies that will help increase safety, improve equity and promote sustainable and active transportation. They will be scored across eight sections; vehicle information, maintenance, operations, education/engagement, hiring, data, sustainability and company history. Factors such as safety features, multiple pricing options including low income and non-smart phone, local partnerships and more are included in the application scoring.",https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2019/07/11/heres-the-changes-coming-to-baltimores-dockless.html

They can be used to commute to work and to see the city. “I live in the city, I live in Fed Hill so when I work down here, or I’m going to a bar, to a restaurant, wherever it might be. It’s a lot better than sitting in a car, in traffic,” said rider Justin Glaze. “People need more ways to access where they live, where they work, whatever they need to get done throughout the day. And we have a large population of households that don’t have access to personal vehicles,” said shared mobility coordinator Meg Young. Despite the popularity, some problems remain. “If you don’t get hit, you’re good,” It’s a problem the city is trying to tackle. “We’re taking measures on our own in increased messaging for riders and for people on the streets, to understand how to share the road and where they’re supposed to ride and where to look for vehicles,” Young said. Someone was seen using a scooter to move an armoire. “You shouldn’t do that, we thought it was funny and would get some attention, but we want people to these vehicles responsibly,” Young said. The city has also been working with the dockless vehicle companies to make the scooters safer, and to hold classes to teach people how to ride. Over the next week, the Baltimore Department of Transportation will be tweeting different safety tips, and sharing promo codes to save first-time riders a little cash.",https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/14/dockless-scooters-baltimore/

Baltimore has reached the one million ride club with more than 151,000 riders riding on Lime scooters over the past year. Lime announced that the Lime scooter trips have replaced around 330,000 car trips, while saving riders and drivers time by reducing congestion. Some of the top areas people are visiting on Limes include the Inner Harbor, Camden Yards, Federal Hill, Fells Point and Hampden. “Baltimore residents and visitors love Lime scooters and we couldn’t be more thrilled,” said Stephen Deline, Baltimore Operations Manager for Lime. “This milestone reinforces how we are fulfilling a need in the community for more affordable and equitable transportation options. With the new permit for more scooters and e-bikes, Lime should only grow as a core part of the transportation ecosystem in Baltimore.” Their records also show that 40 percent of weekday rides occur during the morning and evening rush hours. Baltimore is also a part of the Lime Access program, where individuals who qualify for city, state or federal low-income programs can receive half-off of scooter ride.

Bolt scooters race into Baltimore,Baltimore Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Baltimore, MD",2019,9,19,"Bolt scooters race into Baltimore. A dockless scooter company co-founded by Olympian Usain Bolt has officially launched in Baltimore. Bright, yellow Bolt scooters arrived on Thursday, becoming the fourth brand of dockless vehicles to operate in the city. The company was one of seven that applied for four annual permits last month after a nearly year-long pilot program that sought to determine how the vehicles should be integrated into Baltimore's transportation system. Lime, Spin and Jump also offer dockless vehicles in Baltimore. Bird, which was the first such company to launch in Baltimore, did not receive a permit. Florida-based Bolt's design is a little bit different from what riders of other scooter companies might be used to seeing. Bolt scooters have dual foot rests separated by an aluminum chassis instead of the single rectangular area typical to scooters. The company says the design allows riders to have both feet facing forward, which leads to ""greater balance and overall control."" Some versions of the scooters also include cup and phone holders to limit distractions, according to the company's website. Bolt scooters are currently available in 15 cities worldwide, including Washington, D.C., and three cities in Virginia, with plans to expand into more than 40 markets throughout 2019.",https://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2019/09/19/bolt-scooters-race-into-baltimore.html
Zombie Bird scooters spotted (and impounded) in South Baltimore,Baltimore Fishbowl,,"Baltimore, MD",2019,10,18,"Zombie Bird scooters spotted (and impounded) in South Baltimore. After over a year of renting out its electric two-wheelers here in Baltimore, Santa Monica-based Bird was not among the quartet of firms picked for operating permits back in August. Its exclusion spurred an exodus of the sleek, black devices while others remained or launched their fleets. So, Mileah Kromer was a bit surprised when she saw four of them sitting lined up on the sidewalk outside Riverside Park this morning while she was out walking her dog. It’s not unheard of to see straggler Birds being ridden in Baltimore neighborhoods–apparent remnants from Bird’s 2018-19 tenure here–but the devices at the corner of Johnson and E. Randall streets were placed in a row, looking “open for business,” she says. “They were clearly set up by someone,” says the Federal Hill resident and full-time professor and pollster. “They were very neatly organized.” She didn’t see anyone attempting to rent one this morning, though. And it turns out they didn’t remain outside the park for long. German Vigil, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Transportation, says the city impounded all four scooters this morning “after receiving notification from the public.” (DOT was more boastful about its enforcement efforts on Twitter.) “Our findings show that 4 vehicles were placed on the public right-of-way, but were not available for rent in the Bird app,” Vigil wrote in an email. “We will continue to investigate this matter to identify where the vehicles came from and if any further actions are needed.” It would be odd to find one on the app anyway, since Bird is no longer allowed to operate here. Under city rules adopted this year, a company must receive a $70,000 operating permit to bring up to 1,000 scooters (plus 1,000 bicycles for companies Lime and Jump) to city streets. It’s unlawful for any firm to rent out scooters in Baltimore without a permit from DOT, under legislation enacted in May. A Bird spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether someone affiliated with the company brought any scooters back. But, judging by the duct tape visible on the front of each one in Kromer’s above photo, and a common-enough trend of people hacking the devices, local transit advocates speculate the devices Kromer found were leftovers that have been hacked and put out for rent by an “entrepreneur.” Jed Weeks, policy director for Bikemore, says he’s seen schemes locally in which whoever is putting the hacked devices out “doesn’t let you use the scooter unless you pay them a buck or two.” Kromer, who self-identifies as a “scooter enthusiast,” says she enjoys the number of the devices she sees around Federal Hill and Riverside. “Everybody looks so thrilled to be riding them, even in the morning on the way to work.” She was just surprised to see these ones making a comeback after they’d all but disappeared. “Those are banned,” she thought to herself. “That’s like contraband now.”",https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/zombie-bird-scooters-spotted-and-impounded-in-south-baltimore/

Lyft Pulling Scooters From 6 U.S. Cities; D.C. Not Impacted,CBS Baltimore,CBS,"Baltimore, MD",2019,11,18,"Lyft Pulling Scooters From 6 U.S. Cities; D.C. Not Impacted. Electric scooter enthusiasts in Nashville, San Antonio and Columbus, Ohio, will have one less brand to ride starting next week. Lyft is ending its scooter service in six cities, the company said in a statement provided to CNN Business. The decision has resulted in 20 layoffs in its bikes and scooters team, which consists of about 400 people. In Atlanta, the e-scooter end date is November 23, according to a message sent to customers. “We’re choosing to focus on the markets where we can have the biggest impact. We’re continuing to invest in growing our bike and scooter business but will shift resources away from smaller markets and toward bigger opportunities,” the company said in its statement. The other cities losing their Lyft scooters are Dallas and the Phoenix area. The scooters will disappear from streets in Dallas by November 22, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. The decision in Atlanta left customers like Ryan Colburn, a master’s student at Georgia Institute of Technology, disappointed. Colburn has ridden Lyft scooters a few times a week and used to ride the Jump electric bicycles before the Uber subsidiary pulled them out of the city. “Lyft scooters were the next best thing, and I loved riding them. They have the best acceleration and braking of any other scooter I’ve tried here,” Colburn told CNN through Twitter. “For me, so many of the trips I need to make are too far to walk most of the time, but also a bit too short for me to want to deal with my car. They are especially nice when going up the hills here in Atlanta (something that isn’t fun on a normal bike). I’m super sad to see them leave. Other scooters aren’t as nice to use or are more expensive.” Scooters have been a controversial topic around the country following reports of injuries and deaths. Since May, four people have been killed in Atlanta while riding an e-scooter, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The city has since imposed a nighttime e-scooter and e-bike ban and prohibited the issuance of additional scooter permits. The following cities and communities will continue to have Lyft scooters (for now): San Diego, Austin, Denver, Los Angeles (including Santa Monica), Miami, Minneapolis, Washington DC metro (which includes Montgomery County, Arlington, Alexandria) and the Bay Area (which includes San Jose and Oakland).",https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/11/18/lyft-pulling-scooters-from-6-u-s-cities-d-c-not-impacted/

"Electric scooters for grown-ups now available for rent in SF, San Jose",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,3,29,"Electric scooters for grown-ups now available for rent in SF, San Jose. A company called Bird unleashed a flock of motorized scooters for short rentals in San Francisco and San Jose over the weekend. These are scooters with handlebars that you ride standing up — a grown-up, electrified version of the kind little kids ride. They are not Vespa-style scooters like the ones Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn rode in “Roman Holiday.” The system is called dockless or stationless because the scooters can be left anywhere to be picked up by the next rider. Asked if Bird has permits to operate a scooter rental, a spokesman said in an email, “We believe that we have all the licenses and permits necessary to operate in each of the cities. We also recognize that this is new technology, so we understand cities may still be determining the best way to regulate it and we look forward to working closely with local officials to develop a framework that works for everyone.” LimeBike, a bike-rental company based in San Mateo, is also testing electric scooters in the city. On Wednesday, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency sent a letter to Bird, LimeBike and Spin, which is also starting e-scooter rentals. It said it “will actively enforce local laws protecting the city’s right of way.” It also asked them to submit “a business plan for operation in the city” and provide a copy of the registration required to operate a business. Bird, a startup, lets people rent electric scooters with a mobile app. So-called ""dockless"" rental companies let people leave vehicles on sidewalks, a practice that is controversial in many cities. Bird, a startup, lets people rent electric scooters with a mobile app. So-called ""dockless"" rental companies let people leave vehicles on sidewalks, a practice that is controversial in many cities. Photo: Bird Paul Rose, a spokesman for the agency, said electric scooters “are not explicitly covered in the transportation code.” On March 6, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors introduced legislation requiring a permit to operate motorized scooters. Until then, they are not prohibited, although “it is illegal to place a scooter or any other object in a manner that obstructs the sidewalk or other pedestrian paths of travel,” Rose said. State law prohibits riding motorized scooters on any sidewalk and requires operators to have a valid driver license and wear a helmet. The letter warned the companies that “it will not tolerate any business model” that obstructs the public right of way or poses a safety hazard. San Jose also does not require permits or regulate electric scooters, often called e-scooters. Bird “did not reach out (to the city) beforehand. They called us (Monday) to let us know they dropped off scooters in our city,” said Colin Heyne, a spokesman for the San Jose Department of Transportation. While both cities say they are eager to encourage alternatives to cars, neither wants to end up like some places in China where the streets and sidewalks are littered with dilapidated bikes dropped off by stationless bike-rental companies. San Francisco and San Jose both have agreements with Motivate to operate Ford GoBike, a bike-rental operation whose pedal-powered bikes are parked in stations around town. The contracts prohibit other fixed-location bike-rental operations from doing business in the two cities. San Francisco has given Jump an exclusive permit to operate electric-assisted bikes that can be locked to any bike rack and are therefore called stationless. San Francisco also has permitted Scoot, which places Vespa-style scooters (which the city calls mopeds) on city streets. “We welcome improved mobility options. But we want to carefully consider the potential benefits and impacts of any new private transportation service,” Rose said. The Bird scooters are calibrated to go a maximum of 15 mph and last about 15 miles on a charge. They are located and unlocked with a smartphone app. The cost is $1 to start each ride plus 15 cents for each minute, so a two-minute ride would cost $1.30. Bird, based in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, said it has about 175 scooters in each of the two cities, although “that number is constantly in flux as we recharge Birds, and maintain them,” a spokesman wrote. The company plans to add scooters to meet demand and remove any that don’t get at least three rides a day. He added that Bird is “committed to taking action to avoid cluttering sidewalks. That’s why we instruct riders to avoid parking in public pathways and to park at bike racks when available.” LimeBike, which operates dockless bike rentals in numerous cities, dropped off some e-scooters (the stand-up kind) in San Francisco last weekend as part of Sunday Streets in the Excelsior neighborhood, and the previous weekend “as part of a pop-up in conjunction with the St. Patrick’s Day weekend festivities,” said LimeBike spokesman Joe Arellano. LimeBike scooters are “powered by batteries and require collection every night, which helps to limit the amount of time they are on the streets.” LimeBike rolled out a fixed-location bike-rental operation in San Jose, but got a cease-and-desist order because it violated the contract the city had with Motivate. It has an agreement with two shopping centers in San Jose, Santana Row and Valley Fair, to operate bike rentals on their properties, Heyne said.

After reading my column about the influx, reader Donna Bird sent me photos of scooters from LimeBike, Spin and Bird cluttering the South of Market sidewalks. “I walk these streets almost every day and they weren’t there on Tuesday,” she said in an email. “As you can see one Bird scooter was blocking the alley sidewalk.

"As Shared Scooters Invade, Cities Must Decide Whose Vehicles Belong Where",Wired,,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,4,"As Shared Scooters Invade, Cities Must Decide Whose Vehicles Belong Where. San Francisco is just the latest city dealing with a horde of new vehicles—from dockless bikes to electric scooters—and struggling to figure out how to best allocate limited space. They appeared one morning in San Francisco, rolling in like the city’s iconic, chilling fog. They coasted through car-clogged streets at a brisk 15 mph, bearing a fleet of dorkish men and women in khakis. Over the course of a few short weeks in March, the City by the Bay became one of several test grounds for these electric scooters, the latest deluge of mobility options from cash-rich companies offering yet another alternative to the traditional ways of getting around town. There’s Bird, which also has scooters in LA, Santa Monica, San Diego, San Jose, and Washington, DC, and now more than 175 in the Bay Area.1 LimeBike runs dockless bicycle programs, too, but has its scooters in San Diego, DC, and SF. Spin has under 50 scooters in the Bay. Combined, they have more than $200 million in funding. The scooters are very good for cities, their purveyors (and investors) argue. They don’t create traffic or emissions. They’re a convenient alternative to taking a car or relying on a not-so-vibrant public transit network. They’re pretty easy to use—download an app, locate a scooter, and go—and pretty cheap, often less than $2 per ride. And besides, they’re legal, because San Francisco’s rulers never thought to make rules regulating electric scooter sharing businesses. As with Uber and Lyft, circa 2010: Who’d even heard of such a thing, before it showed up? Legal or not, they’re cause for concern, or at least headaches, in City Hall. Officials used to managing streets designed for cars are facing a bevy of new options that can create unseemly mess in a very limited space, even as they provide sometimes healthier, cheaper, and nimbler transportation alternatives. Indeed, some corners of the city have reacted with alarm. People can lock the scooters anywhere on the street, and so they can easily impede wheelchairs, strollers, or people who appreciate the ancient art of walking. Users are sometimes not great at riding the scooters, especially in a place busy with cars, bicycles, doggos, pedestrians, and the occasional delivery robot. “They’re small, but they do take up space,” says Miriam Sorell, a senior transportation planner at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. “For those in a wheelchair or with a vision impairment, they could pose a hazard.” It’s not that the city is anti-scooter, she says. “We want to make sure people operate them safely.” For cities, this raises thorny questions, ones that need answers as governments say they’re getting serious about non-personal-car sorts of transportation. Since 2010, hundreds of American cities, towns, and university campuses have installed docked bike-sharing systems. (The Bay Area’s Ford GoBike system, operated by the company Motivate, rolled out in earnest just eight months ago.) In 2017, dockless bike-sharing companies like LimeBike, the Chinese companies Ofo and Mobike, Spin, and Jump, mixed up the business model, nixing the places to park vehicles in favor of an unlock-n-go approach. San Francisco has even contended with delivery robots, which local politicians complain can clog the streets. Cars usually get a few lanes, but there’s only so much sidewalk. Now cities have to make room for scooters, which not only park in the public right-of-way, but are sometimes (illegally) piloted there, too. So what should a city street be, for whom, for what? Who gets to determine the answer? And are we cool if some private companies make money off it? California state law provides some guidance. Electric scooter riders must wear helmets, possess driver's licenses, and stay off the sidewalk, leaving that strip of concrete to the people on foot. (Washington, DC, where e-scooters have operated since February, has similar rules.) But scooter-ers haven’t always scooted on the right side of the law. San Diego residents—especially elderly ones—complain that scooters obstruct sidewalks and driveways. San Francisco techies grouse about near-misses with aggressive riders. Indeed, few scoot-ers actually ride in the street, where they’re supposed to go in the absence of a bike lane. Who can blame them? Cars move way faster than 15 mph. So there have been a few ugly dustups between cities and companies. The city of Santa Monica, in LA County, filed a criminal complaint against Bird last year, resulting in a $300,000 fine for failing to secure business licenses and vendors’ permits. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency sent sternly worded letters to the three companies operating in its city, warning it would “not tolerate any business model that results in obstruction of the public right of way or poses a safety hazard.” LimeBike got the fiercest talking-to; the SFMTA took it to task for launching electric scooters in the city without warning—even after the startup said it wouldn’t. (LimeBike says the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and that its initial launch is just a limited pop-up.) Getting people to use these scooters in the right way comes down to education, the companies say, and that’s mostly their responsibility. Bird and LimeBike both provide initial instructions for new riders inside their apps, and then on the e-scooters themselves. (The label on every Bird scooter explains the ground rules: “Ride safely / Helmet required / License required / No double riding / 18+ years old”.) “We want people to follow the rules, we want to communicate what the rules of the road are, but at the end of the day, it’s up to the user to make sure they’re following the rules,” says Scott Kubly, head of government relations at LimeBike, who left his post as Seattle’s transportation chief last year. “In the same way, if you’re Ford, you want people to drive their vehicles the right way, but when they’re out on the street driving their vehicles, you can’t control how people drive.” Still, LimeBike says it continues to do rider education and outreach through in-app messages, online and offline tools (like videos), and engaging specific communities through local groups and street fairs. Even so, San Francisco is in the midst of making rules—firmer, stricter rules—for electric scooters. In early March, the city’s Board of Supervisors introduced legislation that would require companies to obtain permits to operate e-scooter businesses. The SFMTA is now working on complementary legislation that would outline that specific permitting process. The city could begin issuing permits by May or June. “At this point it’s so new, we want to make sure we have all our bases covered, and compare what we hear from companies to what we hear from residents,” says Sorell, with the SFMTA. “We’ll definitely incorporate into the permit expectations about where those scooters should be parked and what level of education the companies must provide to the riders.” Cool, say the companies. “In many cities, the regulation has not caught up with the technology,” says Ken Baer, a spokesperson for Bird. “There’s probably going be some work that cities have to do, and we’ll work with them on that.” That could, perhaps, include scooter infrastructure. No one envisions a future with a scoot-only lane (SFMTA says it’s definitely too early for that kind of speculation), but a groundswell of support for scooters could push cities to build more space for people who aren’t in cars: cyclists, pedestrians, and sure, scoot-ers. “The bike infrastructure is not required for a scooter-sharing business, but boy, oh boy, I hope that’s what comes out of it,” Kubly says. In the meantime, scooter-sharing companies are not afraid of throwing a few elbows in the form of competing to be the most gracious city partners (or at least make it look like they are). Last week, Bird put out an “SOS: Save Our Sidewalks” pledge, which asks signatories to promise to remove their bicycles or scooters from the streets at night, increase the number of vehicles on the streets only if they’re making at least three trips a day, and give $1 to city government per vehicle. It’s a nice looking act of goodwill that four other companies have thus far refused to sign. “Our competitors’ recent overtures, including a recent “Save our Sidewalks” campaign, come off as insincere given recent criminal complaints and settlements,” Spin president and co-founder Euwyn Poon wrote on Medium.2 In other words: We’ll manage our own relationships with cities, thanks.

Vandals Throwing Lime-S Scooters Into Oakland’s Lake Merritt,CBS SF BayArea,CBS,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,6,"Vandals Throwing Lime-S Scooters Into Oakland’s Lake Merritt. The water level of Lake Merritt in Oakland might be getting raised by the rain from Fridays storm, but recently it has also been getting filled with high-tech new scooters. In video sent to LimeBike, a start-up that rents dockless bicycles and scooters, Tai Decker showed the company where to come fish out one of their brand new “Lime-S” scooters. “Just wanted to show you guys you’ve got a scooter stuck in Lake Merritt over here by the Terrace Room Lake Merritt Hotel,” Decker said in the video. On Friday, Decker spoke to KPIX 5 about his concerns over the scooter. “I was wondering how I could retrieve it for them, but I ended up just walking by and then left a direct message on their Facebook,” he explained. It isn’t the first time it has happened. A quick search on social media reveals a numbers of pictures of Lime-S scooters dumped into Lake Merritt recently. When ford go bikes were first introduced in Oakland, they ended up in the lake too. Birds at the lake found the underwater bikes were better for perching than pedaling. Local residents had ideas about why the vandalism of the bikes and scooters was happening. “I think because they can. They’re easy targets,” said one local. Brad Mitchell lives near the lake and said people should embrace the new bike and scooter shares. “I don’t feel it. I don’t see why people would want to destroy property like that,” explained Mitchell. “It seems like people are trying to add something to the city to make it better for commuters in lots of different ways.” “I would hope it’s not our neighbors,” said Oakland resident Pear Michaels. “We live in walking distance to the lake, and I would hope that neighbors wouldn’t be so frustrated by traffic or gentrification that they would do something like that.” LimeBike has local teams that are responsible for collecting the scooters. They have already fished a few out of Lake Merritt, including one pulled out of the lake last week near Children’s Fairyland. “People shouldn’t park them and block the way, I can certainly see wanting them out of the way, but I can’t feel throwing them in the lake,” said Mitchell.",https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/04/06/vandals-throwing-lime-s-scooters-into-oaklands-lake-merritt/
"As complaints roll in, San Francisco considers action over wave of motorized scooters",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,9,"As complaints roll in, San Francisco considers action over wave of motorized scooters. San Francisco, whose sidewalks and streets have seen just about everything, were invaded by something new at the tail end of March — hundreds of motorized stand-up scooters meant to be shared for short rides. The scooters, capable of speeds up to 15 mph, appeared suddenly, and since their arrival, they’ve drawn praise from early users and a flood of complaints from people who don’t like one of the slender two-wheelers’ biggest features: They can be parked anywhere. And they are. City Attorney Dennis Herrera said his office has received numerous complaints, particularly about sidewalks becoming “dumping grounds for commercial scooters.” His office, he said, is “examining all of our legal options to protect the more than 1 million people who use San Francisco’s sidewalks every day.” Detractors complain that riders are leaving the scooters — sometimes piling them — in the middle of sidewalks and bike lanes, and blocking building entrances with them. Pedestrians say they’ve tripped over them, and people with disabilities say they’re unwelcome and difficult obstacles to navigate around. Some users exacerbate the problem by illegally riding the scooters on sidewalks, buzzing pedestrians as they weave in and out of crowds. The scooters, deposited on the sidewalks by three transportation startup companies, have quickly become common sights downtown, South of Market and in the Financial District. “Kids, parents with strollers, seniors or people in wheelchairs shouldn’t be tripping over scooters or forced into traffic to get around them,” Herrera said. “San Franciscans’ safety and public resources are not commodities for these companies to monetize. San Francisco has had enough of the mantra ‘move fast and break things.’” Some cities, including Austin, Texas, and Santa Monica, have adopted ordinances or policies that allow scooters left on sidewalks to be impounded. And San Francisco’s Municipal Transportation Agency also wants to regulate scooters, beginning with requiring the companies that own them to seek operating permits and agree to comply with regulations yet to be established. The MTA is working with Supervisor Aaron Peskin on legislation. Peskin said he gets daily complaints from constituents, often including pictures of people riding scooters on sidewalks or of scooters parked where they block people walking or using wheelchairs on city sidewalks. “They decided to dump these things on the streets and not ask for permission first,” he said. The shared electric scooters arrived in San Francisco en masse during last few days of March, following previews at the city’s St. Patrick’s Day and Sunday Streets events a couple of weeks earlier. Three companies — LimeBike, based in San Mateo; Bird Rides, headquartered in Venice (Los Angeles County); and Spin, located in San Francisco — own the scooters and lease them to people who unlock them with a mobile phone app. For now, all three charge the same rates: a flat $1 fee to unlock the scooter plus 15 cents per minute of use. The companies scatter the fully charged scooters around the city at locations where they believe they’ll be used. The scooters are popular with people trying to get from BART to work, heading to a meeting a few blocks away, or visiting the city and observing the sights. Juliana Greene, 28, an education administrator, has become a regular user, even renting a scooter near AT&T Park on Sunday to get back to BART after a Giants game. “It was better than waiting for Muni,” she said Monday, as she unlocked a scooter near Fifth and Mission streets to get to a South of Market destination several blocks away. For now, the MTA can’t do anything about the scooters, agency spokesman Paul Rose said, because they’re not mentioned in any city or agency ordinances. Peskin introduced a bill on March 6 giving the agency that power. The soonest the MTA is likely to be able to adopt regulations is the end of this month, Peskin said. The MTA sent all three companies letters on March 29 notifying them that permit requirements are imminent and encouraging their cooperation in keeping sidewalks and streets passable in the meantime. State law does impose some rules on electric scooters that the police can enforce. They’re banned from sidewalks, they can be used only by licensed drivers older than 18, and riders must wear helmets. The scooters can’t be parked where they’re an obstruction, according to the law. But the city wants tighter regulation. The scooters are widely viewed as a problem. Representatives for all three companies, however, say they’re following the laws, and that they have processes that require users to acknowledge that they’ll abide by the rules before they rent the scooters. All three also acknowledge the parking issue, and have told the MTA they’ll work to resolve it. Bird, which ran into trouble in Santa Monica, settling three complaints for breaking city ordinances for more than $300,000 in February, created a “Save Our Sidewalks” pledge about the same time its bikes appeared in San Francisco. The program vows to pick up scooters nightly, reposition them to areas where they’re most likely to be used, and remove any that aren’t used at least three times a day in an effort to limit the number of scooters. The pledge, which Bird has invited other operators to sign on to, also promises to pay $1 per scooter per day to the city. So far, no one else has agreed, said David Estrada, Bird’s chief legal officer and head of government regulation. Estrada, who formerly held the same post for Lyft, said Bird is committed to working with the MTA and suggested that the scooters could be accommodated by taking a parking place on each block, applying diagonal stripes and reserving it for scooter parking only. Joe Arellano, a spokesman for Lime, said his company is working to set up hubs at businesses where riders could park scooters. He also suggested that the city could mark spots on sidewalks to advise renters where to park. People who rely on the city sidewalks say something needs to be done. Allen Johnson, 61, relies on crutches to get around. He hasn’t had a run-in with a scooter yet, but he says they’re additional obstacles, and challenges, for people with disabilities. “Just putting these things everywhere and anywhere doesn’t make sense,” he said. “As a person who has a mobility problem, I have an issue with that.” So does Cathy DeLuca, policy and program director for Walk San Francisco, a pedestrian advocacy group. The group successfully battled to keep delivery robots off of sidewalks and has turned its attention to motorized scooters. “We don’t want people using motorized devices,” she said, “on the one safe place to walk.”",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/New-scooters-in-town-a-hit-with-riders-not-so-12819523.php
Everything you need to know about the great electric-scooter takeover of San Francisco,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,9,"Everything you need to know about the great electric-scooter takeover of San Francisco. Do not ride on sidewalks, do not ride on sidewalks, do not ride on sidewalks. No one, including you, looks smurfy riding a scooter after the age of 9. But that hasn’t stopped scores of companies from studding San Francisco sidewalks with an abundance of motorized scooters. Spin. Bird. LimeBike. Over the last two weeks, these cash-flush companies have offered up endless two-wheel transportation to the denizens of tech-stoked San Francisco. In all, these companies have more than $200 million in funding. They’re not going anywhere anytime soon. The advantages: a reduction in traffic and emissions, looks like loads of fun to use. The drawbacks: sidewalk congestion, corroded personal image in the community. But is an electric scooter right for you? Here are a few things to know before putting foot to two-wheel platform. Are they legal? Legal, yes. As of now, there are no rules in San Francisco regulating electric-scooter-sharing businesses. Are they legal to ride on sidewalks? No. Like bicycles, they are not permitted on sidewalks, according to transit code sec. 7.2.13. Alas, this has not stopped riders from abusing the leniency of this law. Sidewalks are for pedestrians. Per the California Department of Motor Vehicles, “A motorized scooter may be operated on a bicycle path, trail or bikeway, but not on a sidewalk. On the roadway, it must be operated in the bicycle lane, if there is one. On roads without bicycle lanes, motorized scooters may operate where the speed limit is 25 mph or less, and shall be ridden as close to the right hand curb as possible, except to pass or turn left.” It should be noted that non-motorized user-propelled vehicles (NUV), which are classified as different than electric scooters, may ride upon any business sidewalk within the city or any sidewalk “between the period commencing one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise,” per transportation code 7.2.13. And electric personal assistive mobility devices (e.g., wheelchairs) are, of course, legal on all sidewalks. Are people riding them on sidewalks? With impunity! Fury-inducing. Cities need to develop a multimodal lane for more than just bikes. Fine, where can I ride them? A bicycle path, trail, or bikeway. Also, Presidio Terrace has a fun loop. Where are they docked? Good heavens, everywhere and anywhere. Just look outside. Unlike most electric-bike-sharing cycles, the scooters don’t use docking stations. You can find them standing almost anywhere and in any neighborhood. Riders can lock the scooters anywhere on the sidewalk, which can impede wheelchairs, strollers, and the mobility-impaired. How fast do they go? Up to 15 mph. How much do they cost? Starting at $1 and up. Some rides cost only $2. Do I have to download an app? Yes. The app will guide your through the payment and undocking process. Hey, you have to wear a helmet? Yes. It’s the law. You need to wear a helmet while riding an electric scooter. Are riders really wearing helmets? No. What about the scooters piling up like this? Perish the thought, says scooter company Bird, which has pledged to do a daily pickup of abandoned bikes, “not increase the number of vehicles in a city unless they are being used on average at least three times per vehicle per day,” and “remit $1 per vehicle per day to the city in order to build more bike lanes and maintain shared infrastructure.” The other companies have not yet signed this show of good faith/PR. There is a possibility that scooters will oversaturate city sidewalks, a la Mountain View and Google bikes. Time will tell. What does SFMTA think of the scooters? According to Wired, “The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency sent sternly worded letters to the three companies operating in its city, warning it would ‘not tolerate any business model that results in obstruction of the public right of way or poses a safety hazard.’” Draw from that what you will. What do the San Francisco mayoral candidates think of the scooters? Are they regulated? Not yet. According to TechCrunch. SFMTA and city lawmakers are currently looking to form legislation to “create appropriate permits and requirements to regulate motorized scooter sharing in the public right-of-way.” Regulation at this point is on a company-by-company basis. Euwyn Poon, president and co-founder, Spin, explains ”We reached out to the appropriate stakeholders before operating in San Francisco. After we solicited feedback and suggestions from them on piloting our scooters in a safe, responsible way, we began deploying small batches of scooters to test and collect data. Since then, we’ve been providing regular updates to and sharing data with SFMTA and other city stakeholders. As we introduce more scooters, we’ll continue what we’ve already been doing by involving SFMTA, MTC, and the Board of Supervisors each step of the way.” Have any scooters ended up in the water yet? Yes. What’s the age limit? Eighteen and older, please. Will they catch on? The odds are good. According to Curbed LA, “early reactions from riders suggest its catching on... [s]idewalks and side streets are filled with the scooters, since the dockless vehicles, locked and unlocked with an app, can be dropped off and picked up anywhere.” But what about Jump bikes? They, too, are everywhere. And like their scooter counterparts, they too are, mercifully, motorized. They fall under the same legality as bikes. What about skateboards? Update: Curbed SF reader bobics points out that electric skateboards (e.g. Boosted Board, OneWheel) fall under California’s AB-604, which allow these types of devices to ride on the sidewalk. “Electric scooters do not appear to be considered an ‘electrically motorized board.’” More information on skateboarders’ rights in SF.",https://sf.curbed.com/2018/4/5/17202690/electric-scooters-san-francisco-facts-info-how-to
Electric Scooters Fill the Streets of San Francisco,NBC Bay Area,NBC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,10,"Electric Scooters Fill the Streets of San Francisco. Scooter companies LimeBike, Bird and Spin put their scooters out on the streets of San Francisco, weeks before the city starts regulating them. The idea is that people rent the scooters by using an app, then leave them wherever when they're done. In the past few weeks they've shown up by the hundreds, without the city's permission. ""What we've seen is folks moving to and from meetings downtown and also to and from that first and last mile of transit,"" said Lime Scooter spokesman, Joe Arellano. However, not all agree with the scattering of scooters in the city, Supervison Aaron Peskin called it a typical tech arrogance, the companies deciding it was better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission. Peskin said he’s filed around 100 complaints since the scooters rolled out just two weeks ago. He also claims to have tripped over one laying in front of his yard. ""Broke my toe tripping over a Lime scooter laying on the ground in front of my house at night,"" he said. He introduced legislation to regulate the scooters in early March. ""These companies Bird, Lime, Spin decided to dump these on our streets even though they knew that legislation was pending and winding its way through the process,"" Peskin said. Though some residents argue that riders don’t follow rules including wearing a helmet and riding in the bike lane, others agree with their availability. ""It's a great way to get around when you’re stuck waiting for a muni line,"" said Dominic D’Orazi from San Francisco.

"Watch out, Bay Area, the e-scooter revolution is coming to a sidewalk near you ",Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,11,"Watch out, Bay Area, the e-scooter revolution is coming to a sidewalk near you. When Harman Ghotra woke up late, dashed out the door and realized he had four minutes to get across campus to deliver a paper to his statistics professor, the calculations started spinning through his mind. Walk to class: Eight minutes. Run? Too much trouble. Then there it was, parked at the intersection of 4th Street and San Fernando, an electric scooter, the latest craze in urban transportation that is suddenly multiplying around Bay Area downtowns. “I was running late,” said the 21-year-old computer engineering student, “so why not?” With a quick click on an app and a flip of the kickstand, he was whizzing across the San Jose State University campus — and arriving with two minutes to spare. Watch out, Bay Area, the e-scooter revolution is here. In downtowns and near transit stations, the bright green or black electric scooters are zipping down bike lanes and sidewalks, delighting riders, startling pedestrians and catching city officials flat-footed. And, uh oh, two of them ended up last week in Oakland’s Lake Merritt. Depending on whom you ask, the rent-on-the-go, motorized scooters are either an accident-waiting-to-happen or the next phase of the new economy’s ingenious attempt at transforming transit as we know it. Just as with the shared bikes that preceded scooters, all you need to do is download the company’s app to find where one may be parked (internal GPS devices keep track of them), “unlock” it and pay for the ride, which costs $1 to get started, then 15 cents a minute. “It’s wonderful, it adds a whole lot more choices to get around and will help build a great community,” said Shiloh Ballard, executive director of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition. In the last few of weeks, San Jose has joined Oakland and San Francisco as the latest city to become a scooter and bike-sharing battleground, where startups such as LimeBike (purveyor of the lime-green bikes and scooters) and Bird Rides (with the black e-scooters) are loaded with millions in venture capital money and are racing to market — sometimes with little or no advance warning. In other words, scoot first, ask permission later. “They just sort of appeared,” San Jose City Councilman said Raul Peralez of the hundreds of e-scooters that began popping up on street corners and transit malls in the last few weeks. “As with any disruptive technology comes the disruption.” BART has already cracked down on shared bikes, which are piling up on station platforms and blocking fare gates. Unlike the light blue Ford GoBikes, which are part of a partnership with Bay Area municipalities and transit agencies and require riders to “dock” the bikes at specified racks, the newer vehicles are “dockless” and enable riders to discard bikes and scooters just about anywhere. The companies redistribute bikes and scooters throughout the day so they don’t end up in one place. Batteries are swapped for recharging. In China and Europe, where more than 30 startups have flooded the markets and shared bikes are ubiquitous, photos of tangled piles of bikes on sidewalks or at the bottom of canals are easy to find online. San Mateo-based LimeBike, for one, says that it has lost about 1 percent of its fleet to mischief in the 60 cities and universities across the U.S. it is operating. But across the Bay Area, cities are fielding complaints from business owners who say the scooters are blocking doorways and sidewalks. Since the smart scooters are considered mechanized vehicles, they are banned from sidewalks and helmets are required by law. But nearly everyone is ignoring both rules. “We need to educate our community to think, ‘Hey we’re on a motorized scooter,’ ” said Ginger Jui of Bike East Bay, who’s seen more scooters on the Lakeshore Avenue sidewalks around Lake Merritt than on the designated bike path. “This is your role and responsibility not to ride on the sidewalk.” In San Jose, Lindy Stankov and Jaime Avalos, who both work in downtown San Jose, have been dodging the scooters since they were introduced at the end of March. “We’re nervous,” said Stankov, 57, who works at City Hall. “It’s just dangerous.” City leaders, meanwhile, are conflicted between trying to be receptive to the latest carbon-neutral innovation and keeping the streets safe for pedestrians — and they’re scrambling to get permits and rules in place before anyone gets hurt. “It’s new technology. It’s companies competing for the most ridership, and at the moment we don’t have a regulatory framework around it,” said Colin Heyne, public information manager for San Jose’s Department of Transportation. Bird — founded by former Lyft and Uber exec Travis VanderZanden — got off to a rocky start when it launched in Santa Monica in September and was charged with a misdemeanor by December for failing to secure proper permits and ignoring citations to remove its scooters from sidewalks. It settled with the city for $300,000 by February. One scooter rider there was injured in a collision with a car. When Bird launched in San Jose a couple of weeks ago, “they told us the day they dropped them off,” Heyne said. To smooth things over, Bird officials announced a revenue sharing plan with cities, offering to give $1 per scooter per day to help pay for new bike lanes, safety messaging and shared infrastructure maintenance. At the end of March, the city of San Francisco accused LimeBikes of “bad faith” for launching its service before the city had its permitting plan in place, even after indicating it would wait. LimeBike countered that it was a “limited pop-up program” and promised to share data on ridership to improve overall transportation planning. Soon, Bay Area cities will see more than just the lime green and black scooters. More startups are coming. Ofo, with its bright yellow and black bikes, says it is already working with the city of San Jose. JUMP e-bikes are in San Francisco. Dave Snyder, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition, says cities still have a long way to go to reduce Californians’ reliance on cars. But shared bikes and scooters are a good addition, despite the early problems. “They’re in a struggle for market share right now,” he said. “They can’t all survive.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/11/watch-out-bay-area-the-e-scooter-revolution-is-coming-to-a-sidewalk-near-you/
"San Francisco won't push scooter rentals out of town, despite rumored emergency ban",SFGATE,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,12,"San Francisco won't push scooter rentals out of town, despite rumored emergency ban. City supervisors are scoffing at an allegation by Bird, one of three companies that has dropped shared electric scooters on the streets and sidewalks of San Francisco, that San Francisco supervisors were set to ban the motorized devices within days. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who’s been leading the charge for regulation of the rental scooters, said the allegation was, well, bird-brained. “Those people are out of their minds,” Peskin said late Wednesday from Southern California, where he was attending a state Coastal Commission meeting. “It’s amazing that a company with that kind of money would spread such misinformation. It’s made out of whole cloth.” Bird, in a “breaking news” missive emailed to The Chronicle and at least one other news outlet Wednesday night, said the Board of Supervisors was plotting “an unusual action” on Monday known as an emergency ordinance. That’s when the board’s Land Use and Transportation Committee is scheduled to take up a Peskin proposal to allow the Municipal Transportation Agency the authority to regulate shared motorized scooters. It’s a fairly bureaucratic action that would let the MTA create a permitting process and remove scooters without proper permits from the streets and sidewalks. But that’s not how the folks at Bird saw it from their perch in Venice Beach. “It has come to our attention that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering banning Birds and other electric vehicles — and doing so via an extraordinary regulatory maneuver, usually reserved for emergencies like earthquakes,” Bird’s statement read. Ken Baer, a spokesman for Bird, said Thursday that the company’s representatives in San Francisco had heard that an urgent move was afoot to ban the shared scooters, and felt the need to launch a counterattack. As evidence, he cited a quote from Supervisor Jane Kim on Walk San Francisco’s Facebook page: “We should remove these scooters immediately until we implement common-sense rules to keep people safe.” Ivy Lee, Kim’s chief of staff, said Thursday that the supervisor has no intention of banning scooters and was aware of no such plans. “As far as we know, there is zero in the works,” Lee said. Lee said Kim sees the scooters as a way of getting more people out of their cars, but she wants to keep them off sidewalks. “Sidewalks should be for people who are walking,” Lee said. Bird, along with the firms Lime and Spin, suddenly deposited hundreds of electric-powered standup scooters on San Francisco sidewalks about two weeks ago. The scooters can be dropped off anywhere, which has led to a flood of complaints that they’re left blocking sidewalks and building entrances. Critics also say riders use the scooters on sidewalks, which is illegal. But the scooters are clearly popular, especially downtown, South of Market and in the Financial District, where riders take them from BART to work, meetings or lunch. Bird stressed that point in its release. “Rushing through a moratorium on Birds and similar vehicles, without the input of San Franciscans and without careful deliberation, ignores the fact that thousands of city residents love using Birds to get around a growing — and congested — city, and feel good doing so because it does not add to traffic or carbon emissions.” The company ended its message with a cry — a caw? — for support from riders. “Listening to the people is not only fundamental to democracy,” Bird wrote, “but it is also how San Francisco works — and works best.”",https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-Supervisor-Scooter-firm-Bird-s-song-of-12827449.php
Scooter company and city disagree on impending ‘emergency’ ban,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,12,"Scooter company and city disagree on impending ‘emergency’ ban. “Those people are out of their minds,” says supervisor. Update: Supervisor Aaron Peskin replied with the following: “Contrary to Bird’s assertions, regulations are not bans. The companies implicated in the hundreds of nuisance complaints we’ve received have known for months that the City has been working on a permitting and enforcement program for motorized scooters. Instead of moving fast and breaking things, maybe they could yield to pedestrians and city law makers whose job it is to make laws—not to make corporations rich. Something tells me they’d rather just keep giving San Franciscans the bird, though.” The Board of Supervisors introduced permitting and enforcement legislation over a month ago, similar to regulations put in place for dockless bike shares. You can read more about it here. Legislation will be heard at the Land Use and Transportation Committee meeting at City Hall at 1:30pm on Monday, April 16. There will be a public comment portion on this item. Residents are urged to show up and make their voices heard. After electronic scooter startup Bird sent out a press release claiming the San Francisco Board of Supervisors will make an emergency decision next week to ban the newfangled scooters, one city lawmaker says otherwise. Via a “breaking” email sent to Curbed SF, Bird said the Board of Supervisors will invoke ”an extraordinary regulatory maneuver, usually reserved for emergencies like earthquakes” by banning electric vehicles “without the standard process that invites input from constituents, industry members, and time to discuss any regulatory framework.” However, that isn’t exactly the case, according to supervisor Aaron Peskin. Instead, per SF Chronicle, during next Monday’s BOS meeting, the city’s Land Use and Transportation Committee will hear Supervisor Aaron Peskin’s proposal to allow the Municipal Transportation Agency to regulate motorized scooters. “It’s a fairly bureaucratic action that would let the MTA create a permitting process and remove from the streets and sidewalks scooters without proper permits,” reports SF Chronicle. Peskin dismissed the company’s claims entirely, saying, “Those people are out of their minds.” When asked about the missive’s credulity, Bird spokesperson Kenneth Baer told Curbed SF, “We had credible information that this committee will start an emergency process in order to ban Bird and similar vehicles. We would like nothing more than to be wrong about that—if we got that wrong, then great.” Baer goes on say that, in only two weeks, San Franciscans logged more than 50,000 miles on Bird scooters. “That’s more than two times around the earth.” Ever since scooter companies unloaded hundreds of vehicles on San Francisco, the motorized boards have been seen all over SoMa, Downtown, and the Financial District. Critics claim the scooters tend to block entrances and are being used on sidewalks, which is illegal. (Bird says that both its app and its scooters warn riders not to use sidewalks.) Proponents say the scooter saturation is good for reducing carbon emissions and ideal for short-term trips. Bird summed up its battle cry touting the bedrock of democracy. “Listening to the people is not only fundamental to democracy, but it is also how San Francisco works,” said the Venice-based company.",https://sf.curbed.com/2018/4/12/17229404/bird-scooter-ban-electric-san-francisco
‘Scooters behaving badly’ all over San Francisco,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,13,"‘Scooters behaving badly’ all over San Francisco. Popular urban-mobility devices aren’t impressing everyone. It’s been a tough week for electric scooters in San Francisco, as locals liken the two-wheeled contraptions to the vehicular equivalent of an invasive species. The problem is not necessarily the scooters themselves—which have evidently become popular with riders—but the fact that people keep leaving their rented decks lying pell-mell wherever they like when they’re finished with them. The city impounded 66 of the penny-farthing nuisances on Friday for obstructing sidewalks. In fact, stray scooters congregating on sidewalks in their off hours have become such a common sight in San Francisco in the last two weeks that pedestrian lobbying group Walk SF created a Facebook album inviting users to contribute photos of obstructive scooters in the wild titled “Scooters Behaving Badly.” (Which, given the news from Washington DC lately, may have been an accidentally prescient turn of phrase.) Judging from the response it seems it’s not hard to spot the mobile hazards where they don’t belong.

I rode electric scooters in SF for a day. Here’s why we need more of them.,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,26,"I rode electric scooters in SF for a day. Here’s why we need more of them. Scooters have descended upon San Francisco — like locusts or much-needed rain, depending on whom you ask. Nobody requested these scooters, and no one ever dreamed that the sidewalks would be dotted with hundreds of unattended electric vehicles in a city where an estimated 4,000 bicycles are stolen each year. In fact, the dream might not last for long. After San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera issued a cease and desist order against the scooters, the city seized 159 scooters, and the Board of Supervisors unanimously passed legislation requiring permits. But for now the scooters are here, and along with city leaders, Twitter commentators view them as a plague wrought by Silicon Valley on God-fearing pedestrians, clogging sidewalks and discriminating against those unschooled in the obstacle course sport of parkour. Several San Francisco supervisors have expressed alarm that so many scooters appeared without warning, and they have vowed to regulate this novel class of vehicle. The Chronicle’s own editorial board has called the scooters a “scourge.” But I beg to differ. Their rollout may have been rocky, but I’ll give any mode of transportation a chance if it spares me the sardine crush of a rush-hour BART or the awkward small talk of an Uber wedged in gridlock. I’m generally happy on my bike, but it would be nice sometimes to arrive at the doughnut shop without the telltale sheen of sweat announcing how hard I worked to get there. Also, locking bikes against California’s indefatigable thieves can be quite fatiguing. Scooters solve both problems. A city full of scooters is a transportation Eden. Your favorite bakery just announced fresh radish mead croissants on Twitter? You’re only a scoot away. Your girlfriend’s parents aren’t home? Just reach out into the sidewalk and the Scooter Tree provideth. To test this philosophy, I spent the better part of a day recently scooting around the region, probing the strengths and weaknesses of the three companies competing to disrupt the Bay Area hardest: Bird, Spin and LimeBike. Let us pause to specify exactly which kind of scooter we are discussing. In the labyrinthine taxonomy of scooters, the species newly populating the streets is technically known as a motorized scooter, itself a subspecies of the much older kick scooter. Essentially it’s a skateboard with handlebars, enhanced with an electric motor — a child’s toy repurposed as the bookends to an adult’s work day. Since the beginning of April these have been distributed in parts of San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. (The upright vehicles are, of course, distinct from the species of scooter that looks more like a motorcycle with a footrest, represented since 2012 in San Francisco’s sharing economy by a startup called Scoot.) Though I made a point of sampling all three companies’ scooters, I needn’t have bothered: Besides color, there is little to distinguish one network’s scooters from another’s. All three companies declined to tell me how many scooters they have placed throughout the Bay Area, but collectively they number in the hundreds. Each fleet maintains its own app, which unlocks your chosen scooter by scanning a QR code on the handlebar. The app will then ask for your credit card number in order to charge you a surprisingly reasonable rate: a $1 base fee for each journey, plus 15 cents per minute. The Bird app asks to scan your driver’s license; the Spin app advises you not to ride downhill for your own safety; Lime offers to count your calories for some reason, somehow missing the point of motorized transport. All three strongly encourage the user to wear a helmet (which I did) and travel in the bike lane (which I sometimes did) as is technically required by law. Once you give the scooter a few steps’ running start, you switch over to the motor by twisting the throttle on the handlebar and accelerating to a top speed of 15 miles per hour. A brake lever on the opposite handle slows you down. My journey started in North Oakland, where LimeBike has a strong scooter presence not far from where I live. Using Lime’s app, I tracked a scooter down inside the courtyard of a motel on MacArthur Boulevard. In the few minutes it took me to get the scooter up and running, an employee wandered over from the check-in desk. “So that’s how those things work?” he mused. “You just turn it on with your phone?” “So they say,” I replied, confessing my own inexperience. “I guess everything is technology these days,” he declared with a whistle of half-hearted awe. This scooter or others like it had been occupying this corner for the past three days, the clerk told me, operated always by the same guest — an early adopter, since scooters have not stirred up quite the frenzy in Oakland that they have across the bay. I bade my companion good day and shoved off into MacArthur Boulevard’s suddenly intimidating four lanes. Fifteen mph, I would later learn, is a satisfying velocity. But due to a low battery, this Lime scooter maxed out at just 8 mph, which was as exhilarating as riding a moving walkway at SFO. Puttering along I passed a mortuary and noticed three motorcycles parked outside bearing signs that read FUNERAL as a couple of massive trucks passed to my left — a warning too on-the-nose to be heeded. All the same, I double-checked my helmet’s chinstrap. At the MacArthur BART station, I lowered the kickstand and left the scooter surrounded by sculptures, incredulous that this undocked device wouldn’t be carried off for parts and profit before my train arrived, as a bike would be in most corners of the bay. Each scooter bears a GPS tracker that must make them a bit less attractive to thieves, but there’s nothing stopping someone who just wants to watch the world burn from tossing every scooter he finds into the bay. Meanwhile, someone was likely coming for that scooter the moment I ended my ride — neither thief nor passenger, but a gig economy worker who would drag the scooter to his apartment and charge the battery for a fee, replacing it on the sidewalk when charged. Charging is a crucial bottleneck in the scooter ecosystem because battery life is the scooter’s greatest weakness. In the six hours I spent scooting around town and city, I never found a scooter with more than a 60 percent charge. The Bird app translates this charge into a travel radius, which would be very useful information if it were remotely accurate. Instead, the app seemed to round up by a factor of two or three. I was promised 16 miles on one Bird scooter, but it died after just 2 miles, stranding me in a treeless stretch of SoMa. As far as I can tell, the case against scooters is twofold: They can clog the sidewalks when in use and also in repose. From the panic I sensed on the news and social media, I expected scooters around the Ferry Building to be so thick on the ground that I would have to trudge through them like a man caught in a blizzard without snowshoes. In fact, scooters are certainly visible, but they hardly overwhelm the sidewalks. I never found a scooter when I needed one without using the app. Herrera, the city attorney, has said that parked scooters create an obstacle for strollers and wheelchairs, but all afternoon I never saw a scooter that couldn’t easily be sidestepped by the full range of human bodies. Scooters might get in someone’s way occasionally but not any more than all the other less-useful obstacles on the sidewalk, from garbage bags to old mattresses to sandwich boards. As for the hazard posed by scooters in motion, I confess that no one I encountered rode his scooter as boorishly as I did. Strictly for science, I needed to know how pedestrians would react to a bona-fide ass like the one imagined by all the critics wringing their hands about the death of the street as a stage for civic life. As it turns out, San Francisco has seen worse than the likes of me. I scooted between bike lane and sidewalk as it suited me. I zipped up and down the rows of paintings for sale in Union Square. I ran a red light. I kept a close eye out for negative reactions, and the worst I was able to induce was mild annoyance, and what may have been a curse word from the lips of an Italian tourist. I approached a downtown street corner at sufficient speed that a 10-year-old boy, who saw me approaching at speed, shouted “Incoming!” as he threw himself between the oncoming scooter and his sister and mother. I stopped on my own, apologized for the scare, and reminded the children of the importance of helmets. Having wreaked sufficient havoc downtown, I directed my orange Spin scooter toward the Mission. For the third time that day, in SoMa my battery died mid-ride. Fortunately Lime’s app showed another scooter just a block away. That one died under me as well. The problem isn’t that there are too many scooters in San Francisco. It’s that there aren’t yet enough.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/I-rode-electric-scooters-in-SF-for-a-day-12841624.php
Scooters are the mess that San Francisco made for itself,Mission Local,,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,4,30,"Scooters are the mess that San Francisco made for itself. Bad decisions, bad media coverage, bad actors, and so much money — it’s this city on two silly wheels When the barbarians arrived at the gates of besieged cities of yore, they weren’t riding venture capital-backed scooters — though, in a way, underwriting a band of for-profit marauders was the medieval precursor to venture capitalism. But, lo, that’s San Francisco circa right now, a city that has allowed itself to be pillaged by a succession of barbarians to the point where you can now scoot right down Market Street and plant your flag where you see fit. Well, we had it coming. Years ago, my colleague Benjamin Wachs coined a term for events in which more folks show up to do coverage than to participate: “Panopticonference.” This was more than a decade ago, prior to the ascent of social media and the resultant rise to sovereign status of the “hot take,” even among the professional media. Now almost every event is a panopticonference and the facts on the ground are, all too often, smothered under the resultant lava flow of hot takes. As such, a Dianetics commercial-worthy erupting volcano of hot takes has inundated us, cementing the narrative that our city has hit the panic button due to a deluge of two-wheeled tech-bro invaders and our leaders are derelict in their duty to do damn near anything else while they crack down on these ungainly interlopers. Alas. The record will show that our Board of Supervisors has, thus far, devoted one item on a 62-plus item legislative agenda to scooters during a solitary meeting. The City Attorney whipped up some pro-forma cease-and-desist letters, and Public Works deployed a couple guys in pickups to toss scooters in the back — which the companies deploying them, capitalized to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars of VC money, have retrieved for a few thousand bucks. This does not exactly constitute the Spanish Inquisition. Now, if any business with hundreds of millions of dollars on hand decided to drop thousands of objects into our city without consulting with the government, by design, as part of its move-fast-break-things business model — be it scooters, food carts, buses, cars, hotel rooms, rendering plants, Morris dancers, etc. — it would be incumbent on the government to act. Regular readers of this column are aware of my mother’s corollary on such matters: “You can’t shit on my head and make me wear it like a hat.” You would think wealthy, for-profit companies using the public right-of-way should be held to at least the same standards as paleteros selling popsicles in the park. And paleteros, to their credit, don’t rifle through all the data on your iPhone as a major component — if not the major component — of their business model. The dominant “hot take,” however, has essentially been: “Why focus on scooters when we haven’t solved every other problem this city has?” This, the young people tell me, is called “Whataboutism.” It’s a deflection, and it ignores the fact that San Francisco, a $10 billion-a-year municipal corporation that employs more workers than attendees of an entire Oakland A’s homestand, is capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time. So, yes, this city can craft permitting requirements for electric scooters while also allowing you to use 311 to report double-parking or malevolent drivers or other foul automotive behavior. And, most notably, it can do so while spending some $77 million a year to clean our streets — including new teams focusing on needles and other such detritus. Conflating San Francisco’s response to scooters deposited around town by wealthy industrialists and the city’s constant and well-funded attempts to clean up the tangible residue of a nationwide humanitarian crisis is ridiculous to the point of offensiveness — and it’s unfortunate to see media coverage of San Francisco reduced to recapitulating Travis Bickle’s fulminations about filth on the streets. The fetid state of swaths of today’s city is due in large part to a homeless problem borne by four decades or more of catastrophic failures on the federal and state level with regard to housing funding and construction and curtailment of mental health resources — as well as an ongoing drug crisis, and this city’s own rampant inequalities and housing conundrums. This, to put it mildly, is more complicated than an outlaw business tracing back to identifiable individuals. There is a necessary and serious discussion to have about broken lives on this city’s streets. But scooters do not belong in it. Because San Francisco cannot solve America’s homeless problem with a cease-and-desist order. Whether scooters represent an unmet need or an unrealized want remains to be seen. But we can argue that the scooters could serve a useful purpose and also concede that VCs operating unregulated, for-profit businesses on city streets — and engaging in malthusian competition with one another — is not the way to an urbanist’s nirvana. It’s in any city’s interest to oversee how companies are using its public goods for profit. And it’s also in this city’s interests to oversee what those organizations do with residents’ information. The business model of most every vehicle-sharing outfit leans heavily on harvesting user data. Scooters are no exception; an alarming amount of your information will be scraped out of your mobile phone or gleaned via your internet activity, including where you go and when. A serious scooter-user will probably have to use multiple scooter apps — meaning they will be casting personal data to the wind. There’s a reason that the hard bargain the city drove with the Ford GoBikes people resulted in riders’ movements not being tracked as they navigate the city (provided you sign up on the GoBike site, and not the Ford Pass site). That could have been a problem if, say, Immigration and Customs Enforcement demanded the data. It would also have been problematic if data revealed a rider’s destination was, say, Planned Parenthood. Or, more benignly, Old Navy — and then the rider was bombarded with ads on his or her desktop computer. The GoBike docking stations, while ungainly, also prevent bikes from piling up in the trendy parts of town while being absent from poorer places a for-profit operation would gladly skip. The city mandated that bike stations be in underserved neighborhoods and be restocked regularly — and that indigent people can get a year’s membership for $5 cash. These are the sorts of concessions that come out of working with the city instead of acting imperiously and then hiring former city officials and PR mavens to marshal useful idiots to lobby the government on your behalf. City sources tell me that the regulations in the works for scooters mirror Seattle’s — which are lenient. So that means that yet another bad actor who did you-know-what on San Francisco’s head is probably going to get a sweet deal after all. But that’s on us. This is the city that knows how … to acquiesce to the whims of moneyed interests. We acquiesced to tech companies high-handedly operating vast private shuttle lines throughout the city and even squatting in Muni stops. We acquiesced to Airbnb running an expressly illegal business that cannibalized affordable housing during a housing crisis; we acquiesced to blackmail from Twitter; and we acquiesced to the hordes of Uber and Lyft and other vehicles rolling into town. “The scooters went full Uber on us,” noted a city official. San Francisco fancies itself a savvy and technologically advanced city, but the notion of connected industries co-opting leaders likely dates back to Mesopotamia. The sight of wealthy corporations and individuals overtly flouting the rules with deference from the powers-that-be harks to the developing world — but, then, so does this city’s juxtaposition of wealth and poverty. Our remaining law-and-order types grouse that we roll out the red carpet in San Francisco for law-breakers. They’re thinking about the dope dealers and robbers and auto burglars who commute into town daily. But one needn’t limit this observation to street crime. Hell, at least we’re consistent. The purveyors of electric scooters put out publicity material lauding their product as if it’s the Jetsons’ car that folds into a briefcase. So, fine. Write moderate regulations. Be as lenient as you please. Then ban all the bad actors who came in here lawlessly; let some other VC-backed companies save the world with their electric scooters. Otherwise we’ll continue to carry the reputation as everybody’s test bed and pushover. And we’ll deserve it.",https://missionlocal.org/2018/04/scooters-are-the-mess-that-san-francisco-made-for-itself/
San Jose considering new rules for motorized scooters: Roadshow ,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,5,1,"San Jose considering new rules for motorized scooters: Roadshow. Q: We have been reading for weeks about the new electric-scooter rentals in San Francisco and their problems. One afternoon last week during a half-hour walk downtown on Santa Clara Street, I encountered a dozen of those fast motorized scooters charging down the sidewalk dodging pedestrians. Maybe San Jose should get a handle on this before it becomes a major problem rather than waiting for it to get ugly. Robert Ayers A: You raise a good point and the city is working on new regulations and hopes to have some ideas ready in September. Under state law, to use a motorized scooter, you must have a drivers license or permit, and wear a helmet. They cannot be ridden on sidewalks and if the street has a speed limit greater than 25 mph, they must be ridden in a bike lane. Like Mr. Roadshow’s Facebook page for more questions and answers about Bay Area roads, freeways and commuting. San Jose is developing a permit system to regulate scooter programs this summer and the system is anticipated to be in place in before the end of the year. Go to www.sanjoseca.gov /index.aspx?NID=3705 for current laws on motorized scooters. Q: While expensive, any thoughts on bridging Moody Gulch on Highway 17? Seems like the elevation on both ends does not make it much of a rise. Robert Mandler Campbell A: There are no plans for now, but something needs to be considered. This was the scene of far too many crashes during the rains of a year ago. Most of the changes being considered on 17 are on the Santa Cruz County side with interchanges possible at Old Santa Cruz Highway, Laurel Road and Vine Hill Road. A ban on left turns at many locations is also high on the wish list. Q: When will Wolfe Road be repaved between Homestead Road and El Camino Real? Will the same bike lane configuration be kept? You must be paying close attention because the lanes zig-zag left and right all the way to Fremont Avenue. There is also a section of Wolfe Road from the light going south over Interstate 280 that needs repaving, too. Marilyn Jolliff Sunnyvale A: PG&E will begin work to underground the power lines next year. Once that is done, Cupertino will then resurface the road, most likely in 2020. There is a short segment between 280 and the bridge scheduled for repaving in 2020. There are no plans to reconfigure the bike lanes as they were designed to preserve street parking based on input from residents. Q: Is Apple chipping in for any of this? Wolfe Road was dug up so reclaimed water could be brought to their campus. Marilyn Jolliff A: Yep. Apple repaved Wolfe between Homestead and the northbound 280 ramp.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/01/san-jose-considering-new-rules-for-motorized-scooters-roadshow/
Scooter skirmish: SF places limits on rental companies,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,5,1,"Scooter skirmish: SF places limits on rental companies. Hoping to gain control over the surging motorized rental scooter industry that landed in the city a few weeks ago, San Francisco officials adopted a plan Tuesday to limit the number of standup two-wheelers that companies would be permitted to drop on the streets. The city’s Municipal Transportation Agency also voted to charge any rental electric scooter companies applying to do business in San Francisco annual permit fees and require them to file plans on how they intend to keep their scooters from obstructing sidewalks. The vote was 5-0. The one-year test program allows a maximum of five rental scooter companies to operate in the city at once and caps the total number of scooters allowed at 1,250 spread among the companies, for the first six months and 2,500 over the following six months. Firms would be required to pay a $5,000 permit application fee and, if a permit were granted, a $25,000 annual fee plus they must put $10,000 into an endowment fund to cover future violations. “All of these fees are meant to make sure we can administer a program without a cost to taxpayers,” said Ben Jose, an MTA spokesman. The scooters, which are silent and can reach speeds of 15 mph, created a buzz after an estimated 2,000 of them were deposited in the city by three firms — Spin, LimeBike and Bird — at the end of March without notice. They became an instant hit with people who had a mobile phone app to unlock them and were willing to pay a $1 rental fee — and 15 cents a minute — to ride them, from BART or Caltrain to work, across town to a meeting or a ballgame or to lunch. But the scooters’ sudden arrival, without city approval, also set off a storm of criticism over riders zipping around pedestrians on sidewalks, parking them in a way that blocked portions of sidewalks, and riding them without helmets. Pedestrians, merchants and politicians cried foul and demanded action. City officials responded with a coordinated attack. The Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance giving the MTA the right to require permits and regulate scooters. Public Works officials impounded hundreds of scooters they said were parked blocking sidewalks or entryways. And City Attorney Dennis Herrera issued cease-and-desist orders against illegal operations, including riding on and blocking sidewalks, and required scooter firms to tell his office how they planned to satisfy the law. As the two-year plan was being aired publicly Tuesday, much of the debate was over the proposed cap on scooters. No one knows exactly how many scooters are currently scattered around the city, but estimates range as high as 4,000. A Bird spokesman said at Tuesday’s meeting that his company had 2,000 on the streets and sidewalks that morning. Jerri Diep, a community organizer with Chinatown TRIP, a transportation group, said 2,500 scooters were too many. Scooters are already crowding sidewalks, making it difficult for seniors and others with mobility problems to walk. “It’s just too much,” she said. “They’re parking and riding on sidewalks, and it’s very dangerous.” David Goulden, a San Francisco resident and bicyclist, disagreed, saying that if the MTA wants to meet its goals of getting more people out of cars, it needs to have enough scooters on the streets. “If somebody’s deciding between an Uber and a scooter, and the nearest scooter is six blocks away, they’re going to call Uber,” he said. Several speakers objected to the perceived arrogance of the scooter companies, saying their bad behavior in not applying to the city before introducing their two-wheelers should not be overlooked when it’s time to issue permits. “It’s time to set a new precedent where we say we are no longer going to reward bad actors,” said Peter Papadapoulos of the Mission Economic Development Agency. Directors agreed, voting to allow “past behavior” by the companies to be considered when permits are being issued. Bird, LimeBike and Spin are not guaranteed permits, Jose said. Rental scooter firms, meanwhile, filed letters with the City Attorney’s office late Monday promising to make stronger efforts to educate their riders about the law, and proper scooter etiquette. All offered relatively similar promises, but only Bird’s came from its law firm, which contended the company is operating legally and cannot control the behavior of its users. “A defendant is not liable for a public nuisance where some of its customers illegally misuse its product, even if some level of misuse is foreseeable in the abstract,” wrote attorney Margaret Carter from the O’Melveny law firm in Los Angeles. But Bird and the others said they would post the rules of the road prominently on their scooters as well as on the apps used to rent them: Don’t ride on sidewalks, do wear a helmet, don’t park blocking sidewalks. They also said they would post a toll-free number on each scooter for people to report improperly parked scooters that the companies would then come out and remove. Spin said it would require users to scan a driver’s license to rent a scooter and would ask them to rate how well the previous user parked the device. LimeBike promised to give away helmets and require users to take photos of their parked scooters at the end of a ride. Bird also said it would ask riders to take pictures of their parked scooters and would encourage them to park at “nests,” locations on private property where multiple scooters can be parked. John Coté, spokesman for Herrera’s office, said the company’s responses will be reviewed and discussed with various city departments. “Our goal has always been to ensure that innovation does not come at the price of public safety,” Coté said. “These scooters could have a role in San Francisco’s transportation picture if they’re used lawfully. That includes being parked in the right place, ridden in the right place and following all terms of the pending permit program.”",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Scooter-skirmish-City-ready-to-place-limits-on-12878761.php
Man's broken arm demonstrates another possible problem with Bay Area's electric scooters,SFGATE,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,5,17,"Man's broken arm demonstrates another possible problem with Bay Area's electric scooters. Dan Grover had been hearing about electric scooters since late March, when three startup companies deposited them on Bay Area sidewalks without city permission. On Tuesday, Grover decided to give one a go. The 29-year-old Facebook product manager found a LimeBike scooter near Lake Merritt and hopped on. ""I can get to the bus faster today!"" he said to himself. At the end of March, three companies — LimeBike, located in San Mateo; Bird Rides, based in Venice (Los Angeles County); and Spin, headquartered in San Francisco — dropped an estimated 2,000 electric scooters on streets and sidewalks in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose without notice. The unexpected arrival of the scooters ignited a torrent of criticism from pedestrians, merchants and politicians, who decried the piles of scooters clogging their sidewalks and endangering the safety of the citizenry. ""Kids, parents with strollers, seniors or people in wheelchairs shouldn't be tripping over scooters or forced into traffic to get around them,"" said City Attorney Dennis Herrera. ""San Franciscans' safety and public resources are not commodities for these companies to monetize. San Francisco has had enough of the mantra 'move fast and break things.'"" Much of the conversation up to this point has criticized the barrage of scooters and riders on sidewalks, and their threat to pedestrian safety. But what of the safety to the riders? Grover said getting a handle on the scooter's acceleration was tricky at first — they can reach speeds up to 15 mph — but he got a hang of it after a few blocks. He liked it, even, noting the ease of use of the Lime phone application and the ""well-designed"" equipment. He zipped by blocks of Downtown Oakland, alternating between the sidewalk and the city streets. The going was smooth, a nice change of pace from commuting by foot or Uber. Then, two blocks from his bus stop, Grover fell. Hard. California law says riding a scooter on the sidewalk is illegal, but faced with the uneven street pavement and not a bike lane in sight, Grover commandeered the largely empty walkway anyway. It seemed safer than zipping along the car-riddled road. Five blocks into the ride, Grover encountered a group taking up most of the sidewalk. He maneuvered his scooter down the sloping seam, between sidewalk and street, and zipped past them. While attempting to get back onto the sidewalk, Grover's wheels hit the seam at the wrong angle. ""That's when I fell forward and faceplanted,"" he said. He used his hand to break the fall. In the emergency room, an X-ray revealed Grover had sustained two fractures — one to his wrist and one where the arm bone meets the elbow. His arm will remain in a splint for up to three months. Lime did not immediately respond to SFGATE's request for comment. State law bans scooters from sidewalks, allows only people over the age of 18 to ride them and requires riders to wear helmets. The websites and mobile applications of the Bay Area-operating electric scooter companies also warn riders to wear helmets, stay off the sidewalks and be aware of possible path obstructions. But anyone who's walked around Downtown San Francisco recently knows these rules are routinely flouted. City officials find fault in this approach. Earlier this month, the Municipal Transportation Agency (MTA) unanimously voted to charge rental electric scooter companies applying to operate in San Francisco annual permit fees. The vote also stipulates companies must file plans detailing how they intend to prevent scooters from obstructing sidewalks. San Francisco officials also instituted a one-year test program that allows a maximum of five rental scooter companies to operate in the city at any given time and caps the total number of scooters at 1,250 for the first six months and 2,500 over the next six months. Read more about the new regulations here. The new rules may keep the city's sidewalks unclogged, but they hardly address the issue Grover, the product manager with the broken wrist, encountered firsthand. As Grover sees it, there just isn't ample roadway infrastructure to support the scooters, nor dependable public transit to efficiently transport Bay Area commuters. ""I'll always take a Muni bus or BART or Muni metro if I can, but there's many times where I'll go to take the 38 or the 19 (bus lines), and it'll be a 20-minute wait,"" he said. When that happens, he walks, bikes or calls an Uber. Cycling activists have long bemoaned the issues scooter riders currently face. Bay Area cities, they say, lack the infrastructure to keep the commuters not traveling by motorized vehicle safe. ""Instead of cracking down on all things scooter, we should be encouraging San Franciscans to travel by scooter,"" wrote Matt Brezina in a recent San Francisco Chronicle op-ed. Brezina is an organizer of the @PeopleProtected Bike Lane, and an investor in electric-bike company Jump Bikes and scooter companies Spin and Waybots. Scooters, he writes, are a viable, environmentally friendly alternative to cars and buses, which emit greenhouse gases and contribute to global pollution. ""But to make sure scooter users are safe on our streets, San Francisco must prioritize construction of protected lanes, where all users of active transit can ride safely, separated from pedestrians and motor vehicles,"" he said. Fifty-three percent of San Franciscans report biking at least occasionally, but driving and public transit dominate when it comes to getting around the city. An SFMTA report found only 3.9 percent of work trips were taken by bike in the city in 2016. The majority of San Franciscans cite the same reason for not bicycling frequently — safety. In 2014 the city launched Vision Zero SF, an ambitious initiative that seeks to eliminate all traffic fatalities by 2024 through data analysis, street engineering projects, public-safety campaigns and smarter police enforcement of traffic crimes. The program is credited in part with helping to reduce the number of 2017 traffic-related deaths to 20, the lowest fatality count in the city's history. The number of cyclist fatalities has remained relatively stable for the past seven years, with a low of one fatality in 2012 and a high of four fatalities in 2013 and 2015. The city continues to install new bike lanes, with a focus on the ""High Injury Network"" — a group of 12 percent of San Francisco's streets where 70 percent of severe and fatal traffic injuries take place. Could a coalition of Bay Area cyclists and scooterists be on the horizon? Perhaps. In the meantime, scooter users would be wise to follow the rules and acknowledge the risks inherent to any mode of transportation — even the zippy, electric variety. Grover hasn't given up on the electric scooters, despite his recent tumble. ""I might just wait for the new models,"" he said.",https://www.sfgate.com/travel/resources/transit/article/electric-scooter-issues-sidewalks-street-lime-bird-12923546.php
SF orders scooters off sidewalks and streets until city selects permit holders,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,5,25,"SF orders scooters off sidewalks and streets until city selects permit holders. “San Francisco supports transportation innovation, but it cannot come at the price of public safety”. In an effort to regulate electronic scooters—heard of ’em?—San Francisco will soon demand the three major e-scooter rental companies (Bird, LimeBike, and Spin) to move their two-wheeled devices off city sidewalks starting June 4 and not resume renting until permits are issued. Even if a company has applied for a permit, they still must pull devices off streets and sidewalks—or else. If a company fails to do so, they don’t get a permit, period. Shared powered scooters found on city streets or sidewalks after the June 4 deadline will be subject to impounding and the companies will be fined $100 per scooter per day. “San Francisco supports transportation innovation, but it cannot come at the price of public safety,” said City Attorney Dennis Herrera. “This permit program represents a thoughtful, coordinated and effective approach to ensure that San Francisco strikes the right balance. We can have innovation, but it must keep our sidewalks safe and accessible for all pedestrians. We can have convenience, but it can’t sacrifice privacy and equity along the way.” In response to this news, Lime spokesman Joe Arellano said his company was downright elated with the news. “We are excited to apply for a permit and will comply with the city’s request that all electric scooters be removed by June 4,” said Arellano in a press release. “We recognize there is still a learning curve for many riders and will use the time our scooters are off the streets to further promote rider safety and proper parking in the community, as well as local hiring, with the help of our San Francisco partners.” Scooter companies have until June 7 to apply with a $5,000 fee for SFMTA’s Powered Scooter Share Permit Program. The permit fee will run $25,000. Permitted electric scooter companies must then pony up an additional $10,000 for related costs. As part of the permit program, companies will share rider data with the city, demonstrate how to keep scooter riders off sidewalks, and offer plans for low-income riders. While many San Francisco denizens derided the electric scooters, which seemingly appeared overnight in early April, many have come not only to enjoy the whimsical devices but see them as convenient methods of short-distance transportation. “This program is a strong step forward,” adds Herrera. “It provides the framework to ensure that companies operating in the public right of way are doing so lawfully and are accountable for their products.”",https://sf.curbed.com/2018/5/25/17392198/scooters-banned-sidewalks-electronic-sf-permits-streets-motorized
Electric Scooters Found in San Francisco Bay,NBC Bay Area,NBC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,5,28,"Electric Scooters Found in San Francisco Bay. It appears someone is throwing electric scooters popping up all over San Francisco into the Bay. Hardy Chambliss said provided photos and videos to NBC Bay Area showing electric scooters in the Bay -- apparently tossed there by someone and left there by the scooter company. Chambliss then said he contacted the company through e-mail to report the incidents. The response he received back from LimeBike was a kind of form letter, Chambliss said. ""It was to the effect of 'we heard you and we thank you and we've told our San Francisco operations manager,'"" he said. NBC Bay Area contacted LimeBike on Monday and received a similar response regarding the scooters left in the Bay. Chambliss said after several days LimeBike did pick up one scooter, but left another in the Bay near Pier 14. Chambliss ended up using a grapling hook and recovered the scooter himself. Chambliss said he is teaching his boys to protect the Bay by picking up trash. ""I'm just hoping they learn because this is going to happen again,"" he said. ""It's happening all over the world.

New law bans electric scooters in San Francisco until companies obtain city permits,ABC 7 News,ABC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,6,4,"New law bans electric scooters in San Francisco until companies obtain city permits. A new law took effect Monday in San Francisco banning electric scooters until the rental companies obtain city permits. For the past few weeks they seemed to be everywhere, but as of Monday they are nowhere to be seen. The rental companies have been ordered to haul them away until they get an OK from city officials. This comes after numerous complaints of riders illegally on sidewalks and clashing with pedestrians, along with scooters being ditched all over the place. As of last week, the Department of Public Works impounded 503 scooters that were blocking sidewalks or otherwise parked inappropriately. ""I've seen them in the most random places from the Land's End nature trail, to mini parking lots outside apartment buildings. That can't continue,"" San Francisco Mayor Mark Farrell said. The companies, Bird, Lime,Spin, and anyone else wanting into the market have until Thursday to apply for a 12-month pilot program administered by the SF Municipal Transportation Agency. ""We're all for the spirit of innovation. We want to provide more transportation options for people in San Francisco, but we want to provide these options safely,"" SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose said. We checked the app for Lime and saw a lot of scooter locations in San Jose, but none in San Francisco. The same goes for Bird because the company didn't seem to have any scooters available in the city. To get back in the game, the companies must have a program to educate riders on the rules of the road, offer access to low-income riders and share their data with the city. Bird released a statement saying, ""we are optimistic that SFMTA will work to issue permits as soon as possible to minimize disruption to the tens of thousands of people in San Francisco who have come to depend on Bird"" The city hopes to begin issuing permits by the end of the month. Companies that disobey the law face fines, and having their scooters impounded.",https://abc7news.com/3560740/
"Save the Scooters, Redesign the Streets, and Save San Francisco",Wired,,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,6,4,"Save the Scooters, Redesign the Streets, and Save San Francisco. Instead of limiting scooters, officials should rebuild infrastructure with their riders in mind. Because a city made for scooters is a city made for freedom. The scooters have disappeared from San Francisco. In anticipation of regulations that took effect today, Bird, Lime Bike, and Spin have warehoused their fleets of the shared electric two-wheelers. They won’t be able to redeploy them unless the city grants them a special permit, which could take the better part of the month. Good riddance, many will say. The city should cap their numbers, control their behavior, or, better yet, incinerate the whole lot. They and their hubristic riders are a menace, terrorists of the sidewalk. That’s why I smear them with feces and throw them into trees. Yes, the scooters have been a pain since these three companies tossed them by the thousands onto San Francisco streets in March, then saw ridership rates explode. But it’s not because those newly scooting users are jerks. It’s because the city as structured is hostile to people willing to look like dopes in exchange for a ride that doesn’t get stuck in traffic, that’s faster and easier than walking, and doesn’t emit greenhouse gases. City officials shouldn’t limit the scooters. They should do everything they can to benefit them. Namely, rejigger San Francisco’s infrastructure—every street, every block—with their riders in mind. Because a city made for scooters is a city ready to embrace a cornucopia of mobility options that don’t require sitting in a car, clogging the streets, and choking the planet. A city made for freedom. Most anti-scooter vitriol falls into one of two categories. The first is that they represent everything said to be wrong with San Francisco. Their riders are the same tech workers who are driving up the cost of living. The tech workers who are making already scarce affordable housing even scarcer, and exacerbating the already distressing problem of homelessness. The employees of companies like Bird, which is drowning in venture capital money and is reportedly worth $1 billion. These are big, knotty, real problems, but the scooters didn’t cause them, and their disappearance won’t mitigate, let alone solve them. San Francisco needs a smarter, bolder zoning policy that encourages (demands) more affordable housing. It needs smart, bold ways to make life livable for those who aren’t rich, and to help the thousands of people living on its streets. The second general complaint about the scooters is that they’re infuriating. People ride them on sidewalks, weaving around pedestrians or passing them from behind without warning. Because they can park them wherever they like, they leave them in the middle of the sidewalk, where they get in people’s way and make getting around even harder for those who have trouble walking or use wheelchairs. These are valid gripes. But let’s look at why people ride the way they do. First, scooter riders don’t have a monopoly on obnoxious behavior. Drivers speed, block the box, and stop in crosswalks. Pedestrians cross the street when they shouldn’t and step cluelessly into the bike lane. Cyclists roll through red lights and stop signs, even when it means cutting off somebody with the right of way. You’re not perfect either, so zip it. Now, about riding on the sidewalk, which is illegal under California state law (not that anyone’s enforcing it): No one does this because it’s convenient. The sidewalk is narrow and cluttered—with humans on foot, trees, parking meters, and those dang scooters strewn about. But compared with riding in the street, where bike lanes are scarce, routinely violated by cars, and speeding is pervasive, the sidewalk is safe. You can be annoyed by these two-wheelers sharing your walking space. But you shouldn’t be surprised.

Make the street a safe space for scooters. This part’s easy, and it looks a lot like what San Francisco and other American cities have finally started to learn. The answer is bike lanes: big, wide, protected bike lanes, and lots of them. The way to make them is to take away curbside parking—that shared space that car owners get to take over, often for free—and use the space to make the streets safe and convenient for everyone who wants to ride a scooter, or a bike, or a one-wheel, or whatever ridiculous thing comes next. While you’re at it, make the sidewalks wider too. The obstruction issue is harder to forgive. I constantly find scooters parked near the middle of the sidewalk, instead of leaning against a wall, or somewhere that isn’t obviously horrible. How about leaving them in bike corrals, or something with a more inclusive name? We’ll call them No-Car Corrals. The recipe is straightforward: Take one to two parking spaces now used by cars. Paint a big box around the space or, better yet, surround it with bollards, or planter boxes, or whatever. Put in some bike racks. Maybe some railings to keep the scooters upright. Repeat the process until you’ve got one on every block. Then engage with Bird, Lime Bike, Spin, and every other scooter provider, and get them to penalize users who don’t use the corrals. OK, so look at this! You’ve got a city full of wide, safe spaces for people who aren’t in cars, and you’ve scooched all the scoots off the sidewalk. Sure, you’ve killed some parking, and that will inconvenience some people. But you’ve made it easier and safer to get around without a car, reducing traffic in the first place. Now you just have to pour some money into public transit and really make cars optional. And if some jerk on a scooter still chooses to roll down the sidewalk? Well, then you have my permission to clothesline them.",https://www.wired.com/story/san-francisco-scooter-ban/
"SF’s Scooter sweepstakes: Lyft, Uber among a dozen companies seeking city permits",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,6,7,"SF’s Scooter sweepstakes: Lyft, Uber among a dozen companies seeking city permits. San Francisco’s scooter frenzy, temporarily put on hold, accelerated Thursday as ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber joined a list of a dozen firms bidding to run motorized scooter rental programs on the city’s streets. The display of interest in a 12-month test program comes despite months of controversy touched off when startups Spin, LimeBike and Bird suddenly deposited hundreds of electric-powered rental scooters on the streets and sidewalks of San Francisco in late March. The unexpected arrival of the standup two-wheelers created immediate controversy, as well as a division between those who hailed the scooters as a quick, cheap and fun way to get from BART to work and make short trips, and those who were angered by users who rode them on sidewalks, weaving between pedestrians, and then abandoned them on walkways and in building entrances. The controversy led the city to force the scooters off the street until the Municipal Transportation Agency could set up a permit process regulating the devices, limiting rentals to five companies and putting a 1,250-scooter cap on the total number of that can be offered to customers within city limits for at least six months. Lyft and Uber, which would rent out scooters under a recently purchased electronic bike company called Jump, are the biggest names to enter the permit competition. But Spin, LimeBike and Bird will also vie for permits along with newcomers Razor, a popular manufacturer of millions of electric and human-powered scooters; Scoot, which already operates sit-atop scooter rentals in San Francisco; and Ofo, a Chinese firm that rents 10 million yellow dockless bikes in 250 cities and 20 countries and plans to get into the scooter business. Other newcomers to file applications with the Municipal Transportation Agency at Thursday’s deadline were Waybots, which rents motorized scooters in Washington, D.C., under the Skip brand, and CycleHop, which operates dockless bike sharing in Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Phoenix, Cleveland and other locations. Rounding out the list are Ridecell, a firm that operates a car-sharing and ride-sharing platform, and USSCooter, a company for which no information was available. It’s possible the list could grow if any other companies mailed their applications before 5 p.m. on Thursday. San Francisco’s scooter test will issue permits to five companies and the cap on the number of scooters will be divided equally among the firms. If all goes well, the cap could double to 2,500 during the second six months of the experiment. Who gets the permits won’t be determined until late June, said MTA spokesman Paul Rose. While applications are being processed, nobody will be allowed to operate motorized rental scooters. The experimental program was created in reaction to the controversy created by Spin, LimeBike and Bird in March. As the company’s scooters flooded streets and sidewalks, especially South of Market, downtown and in the Financial District and the Mission, complaints poured in to City Hall. Supervisors gave the MTA authority to regulate scooters and require permits, and the agency adopted an ordinance requiring scooter companies to seek permits. In addition, City Attorney Dennis Herrera issued a cease-and-desist order against illegal scooter rental operations and Public Works officials seized 503 scooters they said were blocking sidewalks. That battle ended, or at least paused, on June 4, the date the MTA began accepting scooter permits and prohibited rental businesses from operating without them. The ordinance adopted by the MTA included language directed at the three companies by stating that “past experience including compliance with applicable laws” could be considered when determining if a company should be offered a permit. Applications also require the companies to explain how they will keep sidewalks clear of scooters, protect riders’ privacy, provide insurance coverage, offer access for low-income riders, and share trip data with the transportation agency. “The program was built to prioritize public safety, build in equity and focus on accountability,” Rose said. The program is also designed to cover the city’s costs. Companies paid a $5,000 fee to apply for a permit, and those granted one will be charged a $25,000 annual permit fee and be required to put down a $10,000 deposit to cover such things as damage to public property and maintenance. “The idea is we don’t want the taxpayers to get stuck with the cost of anything not covered by the annual permit fee,” Rose said. What’s revealed in the applications won’t be known for several days, after the MTA reviews the documents and redacts information that shouldn’t be publicly released. They could disclose interesting details, such as CycleHop’s plan to install parking racks and a technology that requires scooters to be locked to racks. Jump, an electronic bike rental company, requires its bikes to be secured to bike racks or signposts, said Josh Squire, founder and CEO. CycleHop is also testing a new type of battery that could reduce the number of dead scooters sitting on the streets waiting for a charge.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-Scooter-sweepstakes-Lyft-Uber-among-a-12977329.php
"S.F. scooter companies promise parking, Clipper Card use, charging and more",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,6,20,"S.F. scooter companies promise parking, Clipper Card use, charging and more. Taking over streets, sidewalks and Snapchat stories, electric scooters have become a symbol of San Francisco in 2018. When startups began dumping scooters on the streets, it triggered outrage from residents who saw them blocking sidewalks and doorways and praise from some commuters who welcomed another way to get through the city’s clogged streets. Scooter companies’ valuations soared, as did the number of devices hauled away by city enforcers. The fight only came to a stop this month after the city demanded that companies remove scooters from the streets and apply for permits. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency will grant up to five companies a permit to operate, and a dozen companies are vying for spots. The contestants in San Francisco’s scooter race are going to creative lengths to convince the city that they’re more than a two-wheeled train wreck. The Chronicle identified 10 intriguing aspects of the companies’ proposals and talked to a few residents to see if these features upped scooters’ street cred — or just induced vehicular dread. Snapshots: Half of the companies (Lime, Uscooters, Ofo, Bird, Ridecell, Jump) proposed requiring riders to take a photo of a properly parked scooter to complete a ride, addressing complaints about scooters left strewn on sidewalks. Companies say this accountability will make users comply with parking etiquette. “I don’t think that will be hard to convince people to do, since you already have to use an app to end the ride,” said Michael Ducker, 31, of San Francisco. “But, given how easy it is for scooters to be picked up and moved, I don’t know how effective it will be.” Selfies for safety: San Francisco’s RideCell will offer scooter riders credits for more rides if they snap a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before riding. It’s also asking them to verify, on the honor system, that they’re not riding on sidewalks. “I think it’s more of a feel-good thing that the company is doing. People could just say yes to things they weren’t doing, or they could keep a photo of them wearing a helmet on their phone and just reuse that,” said Janet Lafleur, 54, of Mountain View. “A better way to get scooters off the sidewalks is for the city to make it safer to ride scooters (and bikes) on the street, e.g., with protected bike lanes,” said Max Ghenis, 31, of San Francisco. Crowdsourcing enforcement: Spin, a San Francisco scooter company, will offer a “Parking Rating Tool” in its app to rate the parking job of the previous rider. If the previous user is a bad parker, there is an option of restrictions and possible warnings. “Well, what if someone just comes by after a scooter was appropriately parked and because they’re mad at scooters, just kicks it?” said Lafleur. “Then what?” Phone charging: Hopr, a Miami Beach dockless bike sharing company, says that its scooter will have a port for users to charge phones and other devices. “It would probably drive up the cost to have this extra feature,” said Lafleur. “I think the most important things scooters should be focusing on is being reliable, and not just try to differentiate themselves with little things like this.” Clipper Card support: A critique of the first wave of scooter startups was that they required a smartphone and credit cards. San Francisco’s Skip says it is working toward being eligible for Clipper Card payments. Ford GoBikes, which operate out of stations, accept Clipper. “It’s really convenient to have just one payment method for transit. To be able to tap into multiple vehicles seems like a really great win,” Ducker said. Scooter parking: San Francisco’s Scoot is going against the leave-it-anywhere trend by proposing assigned parking spots, which it already uses for its moped fleet. Ducker is skeptical: “I can never imagine being in a position to not have room to park my scooter — we don’t have enough of these things to be this concerned about parking.” Tip your scooter: Lime, Skip and Jump say their scooters will have sensors that can tell if a scooter is in an upright position. If a scooter is tipped over, maintenance teams will be notified. “I wonder how costly this would be; those funds could go toward better service or subsidies for low-income riders,” said Ghenis, who points out that civic-minded passersby could just pick up scooters themselves. Money where their motors are: A handful of the companies are promising payments to support infrastructure. Bird, a Santa Monica firm, will remit $1 per vehicle per day to city governments to promote more bike lanes and shared infrastructure, according to the company’s proposal. Razor, the Los Angeles-area scooter manufacturer, also plans to give a portion of revenues from every ride to local nonprofits; however, the plan hasn’t been finalized. Skip promises to invest $1 million over two years. Scoot all night: Most scooter companies say they’ll make sure all scooters are off the streets at night. If Scoot gets a permit, it says riders will be able to leave scooters in designated parking spots. The company points out that this is more environmentally friendly, since it won’t have to drive trucks around picking up scooters. “I think there are risks of people being inebriated on scooters at night, and if we’re already worried about safety in the daylight, safety at night is so much harder,” Zucker said. “But if I work late, I need an option that has scooters available to me.” What’s the 311? San Mateo’s Lime says that it has software that can work with San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management to receive 311 complaints about its scooters. It’s using a similar system in Dallas. “I think it would make sense. ... It makes a lot more direct response to scooter problems,” said Lafleur.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/S-F-scooter-companies-promise-parking-Clipper-13008574.php
"Opinion: Love them or hate them, scooters are here to stay",Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,7,6,"Opinion: Love them or hate them, scooters are here to stay. It is up to us to figure out how to live with them now and make them safer and less annoying. Three months ago we found hundreds of electric scooters suddenly deposited on our urban sidewalks. Dropped in Bay Area cities overnight, the for-rent stand-up scooters are both beloved and detested, depending on whom you ask. They are adored by riders who cherish the low-cost, fast and fun way to make short trips around the city. Equally passionate are pedestrians who are angered at having to dodge scooters driven recklessly and parked catawampus on sidewalks, obstructing the right-of-way and building entrances. Regardless if you view scooters as a fabulous transportation option or a public safety concern, they are here to stay. It is up to us to figure out how to live with them now and make them safer and less annoying. Following the familiar Silicon Valley gig economy playbook, the tech companies competing in the scooter market dropped their two-wheelers on public sidewalks before asking permission, taking local government officials by surprise. It is an effective – albeit risky – way to see what works, and what doesn’t. What worked was immediately apparent. The scooters are cheap and quick: download an app, rent them for $1 plus 15 cents per minute and zip along at speeds 12 to 15 mph. Instantly those places just beyond walking distance are connected by a fast, quiet, energy-efficient scooter ride. As the scooter companies have begun to share their user data, it’s interesting to note the number of women riders, some who say the scooters help them traverse areas they’d rather not walk. The scooters also seem to help the critical “last mile” connection for public transit and appear to be especially popular with San Jose State University students. The scooter’s big problem is the double whammy public safety hazard they’ve created on our sidewalks: by helmetless riders whipping past pedestrians and by their willy-nilly ubiquity – parking them wherever they want, blocking ramps and access. Who should be accountable – the scooter companies, riders or cities? Of course the scooter companies prohibit riding on sidewalks, and wearing a helmet is a must. Most scooter riders ignore both rules, but certainly share responsibility to keep their scooters under control and themselves and the sidewalks safe. Pedestrians already have to avoid bicycles and skateboards on sidewalks. Now add the practically silent, speeding scooters with a lack of any enforcement and walking on an urban sidewalk has become a more hazardous activity. San Francisco, with much more density, tourists and scooters than San Jose, reacted swiftly to the controversy by requiring permits, issuing a cease-and-desist order against illegal scooter operations and confiscating more than 500 scooters blocking sidewalks. San Francisco’s Municipal Transportation Agency created a pilot program to limit permits and establish a cap on the number of scooters. A dozen firms paid $5,000 each to apply for five $25,000 annual permits, including rideshare giants Lyft and Uber. The companies have to explain how they will keep sidewalks clear, park their scooters, protect rider’s privacy, provide insurance and share trip data with the transit agency. The City of San Jose Department of Transportation hosted a community meeting last month and will propose its own scooter regulations in the fall. Let other cities plow the new earth of scooter rules and San Jose can then harvest what works best for our own ordinance. While dockless scooters have certainly disrupted urban mobility in the short term, we’ll soon see how company and rider behavior changes after permits, fees and citations. Welcome to life in the big city – and please be careful on the sidewalk.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/06/opinion-love-them-or-hate-them-scooters-are-here-to-stay/
Scooter 'treasure hunt': Nighttime chargers make big money,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,7,20,"Scooter 'treasure hunt': Nighttime chargers make big money. Each night after dinner, David Padover invites his kids to join him in a high-tech scavenger hunt through their San Jose neighborhood. They pile into his Subaru Outback, turn on an app and hunt for electric scooters with drained batteries, pressing a button to make their quarry sound a tone and flash lights. Their usual haul: a dozen or more scooters, which they plug into power supplies in the living room and kitchen. “It’s instantaneous success,” said Padover, who rises early to drop off the scooters at designated locations to be ready for commuters. “You’re there, there’s a dollar sign for the scooter. It appeals to my competitive spirit.” As motorized scooters for rent have flooded cities nationwide, a new gig has sprung up — people scouring the streets as freelance “chargers.” It’s easy to start, signing up with a few clicks and then being mailed charging packs, which look like laptop chargers. Companies including Lime, Bird, Spin and Skip Scooters pay $5 to $10 for each recharged scooter, although ones that are hard to find or need maintenance can bring in as much as $20. The bounty hunters generally work a couple of hours at night, plus an hour or so before 7 a.m. to drop them off. Scooter chargers have already developed their own lexicon and subculture, flocking to Facebook groups and in-person meet-ups. They “harvest” Limes, and “hunt, “capture” and “release” Birds into designated “nests.” Lime chargers are called “juicers,” while those for Skip are called “rangers.” “Me and my girlfriend would walk around, listening to a podcast and picking up six to 10 every night,” said Nick Abouzeid who lives in San Francisco’s Hayes Valley. “It felt really good to clean up my neighborhood and get paid for it. I was addicted to ‘Pokémon Go,’ and hunting the scooters felt like that.” Abouzeid’s hobby has been on hold since June, however, when San Francisco required rental e-scooters to go on hiatus while their distributors apply for permits. A dozen companies are vying to be among five finalists that will get to operate a total of 1,250 scooters (the city could approve more in the future). San Francisco is expected to pick those companies this month. “Rangers are a pretty important part of our business,” said Sanjay Dastoor, CEO of San Francisco’s Skip Scooters, which operates in San Jose, Oakland, Berkeley and Washington, and hopes to land a permit in San Francisco. “Working with a flexible team of freelance contractors helps make sure you have the right balance, because the number of vehicles in a city might change quickly.” San Mateo’s Lime said its local operations teams handle most scooter charging, doing rounds in bright green vans. Still, it has carpet-bombed Craigslist with ads headlined “Charge Scooters, Make Money While You Sleep!” Other scooter companies also have lots of Craigslist ads. Companies that rent electric bikes, which are heavier and bulkier, have employees collect them for charging, or swap out their batteries in place. Chargers say the game-like elements keeps them engaged — although the competition can get cutthroat. Many complain about “hoarders” who stash scooters before they’re officially released on the app. “It gets like Black Friday out there, with people running into each other all over,” said Armando Duran of San Jose. He was looking for a side hustle, but after several forays he isn’t sure that scooter hunting is for him. “Driving around looking for them is kind of a pain in the butt, and finding parking when you’re by yourself is really challenging,” he said. “The last time I did it, I only found two.” Lime spokesman Joe Arellano said it uses GPS to monitor any improper activity such as hoarding, and will remove juicers who “don’t follow our scooter collection protocol.” Plenty of chargers are gung-ho. “This scooter-charging thing saved my life,” said Jason Guillory of San Jose, who has another part-time job with variable hours. “I love that you get paid every day.” He makes about $120 for charging up to 20 scooters a night, and he’s an evangelist for Skip, appreciating that its scooters can be folded up, making them easier to load. He tries to avoid the free-for-all when chargers descend on a scooter, but sometimes it’s hard. “People are getting really desperate,” he said. “It can be frustrating.” Padover, a Silicon Valley systems engineer, makes a six-figure salary but appreciates the extra income, which averages about $100 a day — $60 to $80 on nights when he has the kids, and almost double that when he searches solo. Charging costs him about $1 a day in added electricity. The work can be physically demanding. “I’ve started wearing gloves to protect my hands from getting cut up or smashed while loading and unloading the scooters,” Padover said. “My ankles and lower legs have some cuts and scrapes as well. I’ve been going to the gym less, but still getting a good workout.” His daughter, Raya, 7, is a charging enthusiast as well. “I like helping my dad find scooters,” she said. “It’s kind of like a treasure hunt. My favorite part is listening to the sounds they make when you press a button. Plugging them in is fun too; I like the lights on them that turn from green to red when they’re charging. It looks like Christmas.”",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Scouring-for-scooters-to-charge-is-like-a-13092883.php
"Scooters Set On Fire, Thrown Into Ocean By People Fed Up With Clutter",CBS SF BayArea,CBS,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,8,14,"Scooters Set On Fire, Thrown Into Ocean By People Fed Up With Clutter. Dockless scooters may be a free way to get around California, but many locals are allegedly choosing to destroy the shareable vehicles instead. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, people in several cities are so fed up with the free scooters being left piled up on sidewalks that they’re being burned, crushed, and even thrown into the Pacific Ocean. “They throw them everywhere: in the ocean, in the sand, in the trash can,” Venice Beach maintenance worker Robert Johnson Bey told reporters. “Sunday, I was finding kickstands everywhere.” The problem stems from electric scooter companies like Bird, Lime, and Spin reaching deals with dozens of cities to provide a free form of public transportation that has no central location or docking space where users can drop them off. The scooters are therefore left wherever the user leaves it, until another person comes along to hop on. The clutter has allegedly prompted some to dispose of the scooters in a more permanent way and developed a social media following as well. Instagram accounts like birdgraveyard have already collected over 29,000 followers. “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” Bird spokeswoman Mackenzie Longtold said in a statement. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior.” Despite local governments warning against vandalism of public property, several California cities are also taking action to remove the cluster of scooters dropped on city streets. Venice, which is also the Bird headquarters, has capped the number of scooters on city streets. Beverly Hills ordered that the dockless scooters be banned for six months. Los Angeles lawmakers have also started a push to have the scooters outlawed within the city. Meanwhile, California authorities are urging residents not to take matters into their own hands. Destruction of public property over $400 is considered a felony.",https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/08/14/scooters-fire-ocean-california/
SF Is Bringing Back Banned Electric Scooters—With Limits,Wired,,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,8,30,"SF Is Bringing Back Banned Electric Scooters—With Limits. The city granted operating permits to just Skip and Scoot, two companies that emphasized good relationships with public officials. The scooters are back in town. Three months after ejecting the networks of shared, sidewalk-cluttering vehicles from the city, officials with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency announced today the two winners of its e-scooter pilot sweepstakes: Scoot and Skip. The city chose the companies from a crowded field of 12, which submitted a collective 800 pages in proposals on their operations, safety, and plans to extend the scooter bounty to San Francisco's neighborhoods. Skip and Scoot now have the right to operate at least 625 scooters each in the city—a number that could eventually double. Scooter lovers, mark your calendars: The agency says it will finalize the companies’ permits by October 15 at the latest. They'll be good for a year. Conspicuously not among the chosen few: Bird, Lime, and Spin, which launched scooter service in SF last March, without formal approval from the powers at be—kicking off the hysteria that prompted the city to step in. SFMTA officials insisted, however, that the unapproved launch methods weren’t solely responsible for the companies losing out on prized permits. “Prior experience was one of the criteria, but overall no single factor made the decision for us,” Jamie Parks, who oversees the agency's Livable Streets initiative, told reporters. Instead, the companies’ proposals got dinged for failing to provide sufficient rider training, scooter rebalancing to fit demand, and service in areas typically underserved by transit. This is exactly where Scoot and Skip shined, the officials said. Scoot—which has operated a shared electric-moped service in the city since 2012—said it would force riders to watch instructional videos before hopping aboard, and would use swappable batteries to keep the electric things charged and running throughout the day.1` San Francisco-based Skip proposed a community advisory board, and promised to extend service well beyond the city’s downtown core. Both companies said they could furnish their scooters with “lock-to” mechanisms that will help keep the vehicles out of the way of pedestrians and other sidewalk users. Plus, these two companies played extra nice with the city. For Skip—launched by the creators of the Boosted board—it’s kind of its brand. “We find the collaborative approach to be more effective,” Sanjay Dastoor, Skip’s CEO, told WIRED earlier this month. In Santa Monica, California, meanwhile, officials just announced their own scooter rules, issuing operating permits to Bird, Lime, Lyft, and Uber. (Bird, notorious for entering markets by deploying its vehicles without warning, announced yesterday that it had created a virtual dashboard for cities to use to manage the scooter onslaught.) The cities’ decisions may prove a bellwether in the Great Scooter Storm of 2018, which has seen the little vehicles pop up everywhere from North Carolina and Texas to Wisconsin. As locals hop aboard, complain about the scooters taking up street space, compete to collect and charge them, and hurl them into lakes, municipalities are left to wonder: How do we manage these things? Some, like Austin, have decided to let the companies be. Others, like San Francisco and Santa Monica, have cracked down, limiting which companies can operate, and how. “Everyone’s looking at everyone else,” says Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant and former New York City transportation official. Now many city officials are pondering pilot programs, cast as opportunities to see how scooters might fit into the urban transportation mix. Do scooters really replace car trips, as companies like Bird have claimed? Might they really be solutions to cities’ traffic woes? Could they be used to widen transportation options for everyone, but particularly cities’ lower-income or more far-flung communities? Are they safe? Expect cities to try to learn from others’ successes and missteps. Officials also see this as a do-over, a chance to regulate a new mobility option in the way they never did for Uber and Lyft, when those options stormed into cities less than a decade ago. (Both companies applied for scooter permits in San Francisco and were denied.) “Cities learned two things: to be open to new stuff,” says Schaller. “And you need to guide the introduction, be partners in guiding, testing, and piloting.” San Francisco’s decision to kick the scooters off the streets, then carefully control their return, signals that cities are ready to take back control. 1` Correction appended, 8/30/18, 5:35 PM EDT: Scoot launched in San Francisco in 2012, not 2016.",https://www.wired.com/story/san-francisco-santa-monica-e-scooter-permits/
"As San Francisco banned scooter use, Oakland embraced the two-wheelers",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,9,1,"As San Francisco banned scooter use, Oakland embraced the two-wheelers. San Francisco banned electric scooters from its streets for months, but across the bay up to a thousand of the devices zipped around Oakland, shuttling kids to school and ferrying office workers downtown. Politicians welcomed the scooters, hoping they would drive Oakland’s economy and provide a new mode of transportation for residents who can’t afford cars. That trusting approach stood in sharp contrast to San Francisco, where officials were initially put off by the scooter companies’ aggressive tactics and ultimately picked just two companies to offer dockless rentals. “In other cities they’re considered more of a nuisance, but we can see long-term how smaller electric mobility could solve a lot of problems,” said Ryan Russo, director of Oakland’s Department of Transportation. He counts himself among the optimists, predicting that scooters will bring foot traffic downtown and help merchants on the Jack London Square waterfront — an area that’s long struggled because it’s too far from BART. Members of the Oakland City Council share Russo’s enthusiasm. In July, the council approved regulations that aim to spread scooters evenly throughout the city by setting up a permit system and requiring each company to drop at least half its fleet in low-income “communities of concern.” If the rules work as City Council members envisioned them, then many of the lightweight, dockless vehicles would wind up in isolated pockets of East and West Oakland, where mass transit options are sparse. Whether Oakland can build this electric scooter utopia without sowing dissent among neighbors remains to be seen. While many residents embrace the slender two-wheelers, others are terrified by riders who carelessly speed down sidewalks, park their scooters in front of building entrances or pile them in bike lanes. “The problem with the scooters isn’t the scooters themselves — it’s the way people are using them,” said Warren Mead, 49, who lives near Lake Merritt. “I would say about 5 percent of them are being used as an alternative form of transit. The other 95 percent are people driving to the lake, getting on a scooter and joyriding.” The new transit fad incited a spirited debate on the Lake Merritt neighborhood Nextdoor message board. Some residents decried the scooters as high-speed terrors barreling down busy corridors like Lakeshore Avenue, sometimes with two riders astride one vehicle. Others touted the devices as a cost-effective solution for 1- to 3-mile trips, saying they would help wean people off cars. “People are really negative on Nextdoor, but in my social circle, we feel really positive about scooters,” said Carrie-Andrea Koppelman, 46. She regularly uses scooters to get from her home in the Crocker Highlands neighborhood to her nonprofit job downtown, a few miles away. So far, three companies — Bird, Lime and Skip — are operating in Oakland. They came in more gradually than in San Francisco, Russo said, which might explain Oakland’s more genial response. Company representatives even met with city officials and obtained business permits before bringing in their fleets. By midsummer, downtown Oakland and Lake Merritt were awash in scooters. On a recent Monday morning, a construction worker rode a Lime from his work site at 14th and Webster streets, en route to buy a sandwich on his lunch break. A teenager pinballed down Broadway on a Bird. A middle-aged man grabbed a Lime outside the Whole Foods on 27th Street and rode it while shouldering groceries in his backpack. “These are very inexpensive,” said Jamar Welch, 44, a hip-hop dance instructor who was piloting a Bird around the lake. Welch said he’s criss-crossed the city on a scooter, riding from East Oakland to West Oakland, and from downtown to Eastmont Town Center, a shopping mall at Bancroft and 73rd avenues. “You can spend $20 and go all over,” he said. Many San Francisco commuters also praised the devices when three well-funded tech companies — Bird, Lime and Spin — plopped them on the streets in March. But others fretted that people were riding and stashing them willy-nilly on sidewalks, blocking pedestrians and wheelchairs. In the ensuing weeks, people began showing up to emergency rooms with scooter-related injuries: broken wrists, dislocated elbows and concussions. Christopher Colwell, the chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, said he observed dozens of similar wounds on people who rode scooters while intoxicated or tore down steep hills at high speeds, usually without wearing helmets. “The head injuries are what worry me the most,” Colwell said. “I really wish people would wear helmets.” Though California law mandates that anyone riding a motorized scooter wear a helmet, a bill to lift that requirement passed the Legislature last week, and went to Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk. Bird is one of its lead backers. Meanwhile, a new era of scooter regulation dawned in San Francisco. On Thursday, the city picked two startups — Skip and Scoot Networks — to each rent 625 scooters, starting by Oct. 15. Officials at San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency might double the number of scooters in six months. In some ways, San Francisco’s more stringent regulatory process paid off. The city extracted various concessions from the companies it selected for permits — Skip proposed a community advisory board and hired ambassadors to hand out helmets; both companies are developing lock systems to prevent their vehicles from blocking sidewalks. The companies also promised to put their rental devices in areas with spotty mass transit — mostly southeastern neighborhoods like the Bayview. San Francisco’s approach signaled that the city is no longer going to tolerate the show-up-and-ask-for-forgiveness model that so many technology startups have tried, when they dump their products onto public roadways. “We support the spirit of innovation,” said Tom Maguire, MTA director of sustainable streets. “And we want the private sector to help us. But at some point we do need to make sure that we’re protecting the public interest and the public right-of-way.” In Oakland, as the trend gains momentum, complaints about reckless riding and cavalier parking are rolling in. “I’ve gotten complaints from frightened pedestrians because these electric scooters are quiet and kind of speedy,” Russo said. “And there’s definitely concern that they can block the pedestrian right-of-way.” Oakland’s Police Department began tracking scooter injuries this month, but a spokeswoman said it hadn’t gathered enough data to show any patterns. City Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan, lead sponsor of the scooter permitting ordinance, said she considered potential hazards of the mode when she wrote her legislation. “People aren’t allowed to ride these things on the sidewalk, and we’ll be enforcing that,” she said. And Oakland won’t allow riders to park scooters just anywhere, Kaplan added. They’ll have to stick near curbs, in the same “furniture zone” as newspaper stands and bus stop poles. Like Russo, Kaplan sees the potential for scooters to be a great equalizer in a city of stark economic and geographic divisions. While the more upscale areas of Rockridge and Temescal teem with buses and bike lanes, the flatlands of East Oakland are cordoned by freeways, striated with wide boulevards and underserved by buses and BART. Even Ford GoBike stations are concentrated in the northwest swath of the city, with none east of Fruitvale. Electric scooters could help rectify that problem, Kaplan said. Her ordinance requires companies to submit data on the usage patterns and geographic distribution of the vehicles, to ensure they’re scattered among the neighborhoods. Companies operating in Oakland would also have to provide a model for disabled riders — say, a three-wheeled scooter — and a way for people to pay without a smartphone. Kaplan said she wants to debunk the myth that new forms of mobility are “white people things.” She also wants to encourage more companies to come in: Oakland isn’t picking which companies get permits or capping the total number of electric scooters on its streets. “We’re not trying to have a bunch of companies compete so we can pick winners and losers,” Kaplan said, alluding to San Francisco’s permit cap. “We’re saying, ‘Here are a bunch of rules. If you follow them, you can come in.’” San Francisco has spent years battling Silicon Valley companies that swooped in before the city could set rules for them — from ride-hail services to tech shuttles to delivery robots. That might explain San Francisco’s cautious approach to electric scooters, and why it contrasts so sharply with Oakland, a city that still hungers for investment and innovation. “San Francisco has traditionally been the place where these companies all want to play — particularly in the Financial District,” said Clarrissa Cabansagan, new mobility policy director for TransForm, a regional transportation nonprofit. Because Oakland hasn’t shouldered the burden of being a laboratory, it’s in a much better position to welcome new technology, she said. In fact, city leaders are using new gizmos like electric scooters to fix injustices of the past. “If you look at our strategic plan, we’re all about lifting up Oaklanders who haven’t had advantages,” Russo said, referring to his department’s mission of helping low-income families, community college students and teens who take multiple buses to get to school. “What’s interesting is how the scooters fit into that,” he said.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/As-San-Francisco-banned-scooter-use-Oakland-13198380.php
"Injuries are the untold part of the scooter trend, doctors and victims say",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,9,10,"Injuries are the untold part of the scooter trend, doctors and victims say. The crash happened in a split second, when a Lime scooter zipped down a busy sidewalk in Oakland’s Uptown neighborhood and slammed into 2-year-old Carter Sarmiento. He went hurtling backward, landing on the cement near Valley Street and Grand Avenue. The scooter rider apologized profusely as Carter’s mother, Siena Sarmiento, picked up and cradled her bruised toddler. It didn’t occur to her to get the man’s name. “We were just walking out of the lobby of our apartment building, and we didn’t think to look both ways, crossing the sidewalk,” Sarmiento said. Injuries are the part of the electric scooter story that hasn’t yet been fully told. No one has an official count, but doctors in many cities are sharing anecdotes about people being sideswiped, brakes failing and riders colliding with cars or hitting pedestrians when they illegally scoot on sidewalks. As the incidents pile up, companies and lawmakers are fiercely debating who should be held liable. The accident trend emerged almost as soon as the motorized scooters dropped onto city streets this spring, said Christopher Colwell, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General Hospital. Riders have come in with wounds ranging from broken wrists to potentially fatal cranial bleeding after smashups with cars, he said. Working the night shift on a recent Friday, Colwell saw three injured e-scooter riders. Two had concussions. None had worn a helmet. “There’s a very strong sense from the patients I’ve seen that this is very safe,” Colwell said, noting that he’s encountered dozens of hurt riders, “which suggests there have been hundreds.” Some cities have imposed rules: speed limits in Los Angeles, mandatory insurance and user education in San Francisco, fines for companies whose scooters block sidewalks in Portland, Ore. But not everyone agrees that tighter regulation is the right approach. Last month, California’s State Legislature approved a bill that would lift an existing scooter safety requirement by allowing adults to ride the motorized devices without helmets. Bird, a popular scooter startup, is a major proponent of the bill. Gov. Jerry Brown has until the end of the month to sign it. “For me it all goes back to personal responsibility,” said the bill’s sponsor, Republican Assemblyman Heath Flora of Ripon (San Joaquin County). He sees e-scooters as a vital tourist attraction for many cities, and helmets as an onerous burden that would deter people from using them. User agreements for scooter companies are set up to insulate the companies from lawsuits. Those for Bird and Lime include mandatory arbitration clauses that require riders to waive their rights to a jury trial, and both say the companies cannot warrant that the devices are safe. “I would describe them as draconian,” said Santa Monica attorney Catherine Lerer, referring to the agreements. Her firm has received at least 100 calls from scooter accident victims. Roughly three-quarters of them came from riders who got injured when a two-wheeler malfunctioned: the brakes failed, the accelerator got stuck, the handlebar or stem collapsed or the battery juice ran out, throwing the rider off. Others were bystanders hit by scooters — usually hit-and-run wrecks in which the scooter fled the scene. In those cases, the crash victim had no way to identify the rider or the vehicle, since scooters don’t have visible license plates. Lerer said she’s provided the date, time and location of these collisions to representatives of Bird and Lime, asking them to name the riders involved. But the companies wouldn’t cooperate, she said. Lime spokesman Joe Arellano said the company prioritizes safety, and that it urges the public to report scooter accidents or reckless antics immediately. “If we investigate and determine that a rider was negligent, then we ban the user from our platform,” he said. Representatives from Bird did not respond to questions from The Chronicle. Forensic engineer Philip Rosescu criticized the companies’ approach. “They’re expecting riders to report mechanical failures, when riders don’t necessarily know anything about mechanics,” he said, noting that coastal sea air and potholed roads will cause scooters to degrade quickly in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. An average rider might not notice the wear and tear. Cities are just beginning to document the injury toll from electric scooters. Officials at San Francisco General Hospital expect to release their first numbers in October, around the time e-scooters hit the streets again after a three-month ban. In Portland, staff at the Bureau of Transportation counted 12 injuries, and 1,400 complaints, for nearly 180,000 scooter trips between July 25 and Sept. 5, based on data from the fire department, local hospitals and health officials. Those numbers are small compared with the 1,508 traffic injuries that Portland saw in July and August 2016, the Bureau of Transportation says. The apparent discrepancy has led some transportation experts to wonder whether public scrutiny of scooters is overblown. “We’ve come to accept the idea of car crashes and drivers behaving badly, because they’re so ubiquitous that we don’t notice them anymore,” said Tara Goddard, an assistant professor of urban planning at Texas A&M University. “But all of a sudden there’s this novelty on the road, and our attention is drawn to it,” she said. She and others blame antiquated urban design — and a dearth of protected bike lanes —for forcing the two-wheelers onto sidewalks. Some view the scooters as a catalyst that will compel city planners to accommodate new forms of mobility. “These scooters are the best thing to come along to change the way we think about streets, probably since cars came to replace horses and buggies,” said Dave Campbell, advocacy director for the nonprofit group Bike East Bay. He rides scooters every day without a helmet, and touts them as a safe alternative to cars, even though he’s witnessed high jinks. On Sunday, for instance, Campbell watched a rider stack two milk crates atop a scooter platform and sit on them — with unfortunate results. “He turned a corner too quickly, the crates got dislodged, and he careened into a parked car,” Campbell said. “And then he got up and put the crates right back on the scooter and rode away.” Scooter riders in Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles don’t necessarily use bike lanes even when they have the option. And most cities don’t penalize them for riding on the sidewalk. Although officials in Oakland are crafting rules that would include sidewalk restrictions, some residents doubt the police would enforce them. “The police are too busy,” said Sarmiento, who would like to see companies append clear identification tags to each scooter and post prominent “No riding” signs on sidewalks. Within a week of the accident on Grand Avenue, Carter’s scratches and bruises had healed. But Sarmiento is still anxious. Now when she leaves her building, she makes sure to look both ways. E-Scooter injuries and other reports in Portland, Ore., reported by Fire Department, local hospital and health officials from July 25 to Sept. 5: 178,233 scooter trips 12 injuries reported 1,400 complaints from 600 people",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Injuries-are-the-untold-part-of-the-scooter-13219335.php
California adults get OK to ride motorized scooters without helmets,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,9,19,"California adults get OK to ride motorized scooters without helmets. Scooter riders can let the wind flow through their hair — at their own risk, of course — after Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill Wednesday allowing adults to decide whether to wear a helmet. Brown signed AB2989 by Assemblyman Heath Flora, R-Ripon (San Joaquin County), which brings motorized scooters under the same legal requirement as motorized bicycles — only riders age 17 and under are required to wear a helmet. The bill was backed by one of the leading scooter rental companies, Bird. Besides lifting the helmet requirement for adults, the bill authorizes cities to allow scooters on streets that have a speed limit of 35 mph. At present, scooters can be operated only on streets where the speed limit is 25 mph or less. The scooters themselves are still limited to a top speed of 15 mph, and are still banned from sidewalks. The bill prompted concern from some safety advocates who said it could lead to more scooter-related injuries. Christopher Colwell, chief of emergency medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, told The Chronicle this month that the hospital has seen riders who have been hit by cars and arrived with potentially fatal cranial bleeding. On one recent night, he said, he treated two scooter riders who hadn’t been wearing helmets and suffered concussions. Flora, the bill’s author, said, “For me, it all goes back to personal responsibility.” He said motorized scooters were a tourist attraction for many cities and that some people who might otherwise use them would not if they had to wear a helmet. San Francisco briefly banned scooters after startups Bird, Lime and Spin dropped hundreds of the rentals on city streets in late March, prompting complaints about abandoned scooters and unsafe riders. The city forced the scooters off the streets until the Municipal Transportation Agency could set up a permitting process. Last month the transit agency chose companies Scoot and Skip to receive permits to operate in the city under a one-year pilot program that starts in October. Scoot and Skip will set up a total of 1,250 scooters that people can unlock with their phones in order to cruise around the city.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/California-adults-get-OK-to-ride-motorized-13242802.php
"Spin, Jump cry foul over San Francisco scooter selection process",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,10,2,"Spin, Jump cry foul over San Francisco scooter selection process. Spin and Uber’s Jump are appealing San Francisco’s allocation of permits for rental electric scooters. Lime had previously filed an appeal. “We want to make sure we were judged correctly and factually. We don’t think we were,” said Brian Kyuhoon No, head of public policy for Spin, a San Francisco startup that offers scooter and bike rentals in about 19 cities nationwide. Three companies — Lime, Bird and Spin — burst into dockless e-scooter rentals in San Francisco in March, depositing two-wheeled vehicles on city streets. While fans welcomed the scooters as a convenient way to get around, foes said they blocked sidewalks, and that the companies were operating businesses in the public right-of-way without permission. Spin said it did not “rogue launch.” No said that Spin spoke with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency in February and was told that its plans for a modest pilot that averaged about 60 scooters a day did not conflict with any laws. The MTA did not respond to an inquiry about that interaction. “It’s our understanding that the MTA considered heavily whether companies used a ‘ask forgiveness instead of permission’ approach,” No said. “We actually did ask for permission. That’s a fact.” The scooter onslaught led to the city imposing a temporary ban while it developed a permit process. Lime, Spin and Jump, which is a subsidiary of Uber, were among a dozen companies that in June applied for a one-year pilot program that would allow up to five companies to operate app-rentals of e-scooters in San Francisco. The MTA picked two of those companies, Scoot Networks and Skip, for the one-year pilot program, which is scheduled to start Oct. 15. “After a thorough, fair and transparent review process, we are confident we selected the strongest applicants to participate in the one-year scooter pilot,” it said. The Chronicle previously reported that sources close to the process said that some applicants were dinged for perceived past “bad behavior.” Those included Lime, Bird and Spin, as well as ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber. Jump, which previously won the agency’s permission to operate dockless e-bike rentals in the city, has also filed an appeal, the MTA said. Uber and Jump did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jump’s appeals letter said the MTA didn’t release criteria in advance and appeared to have evaluated offers insistently. It said the agency unfairly rated Jump “poor” for safety, disabled access, community outreach, hiring, and unfairly rated it “fair” for environmental sustainability and experience and qualifications. Jump protested being blackballed over Uber issues. The MTA’s evaluation mentioned violations of traffic laws by Uber and Lyft ride-hail drivers, which it said “create concerns about (Jump’s and Lyft’s) ability to comply with local regulations.” “This criticism is unfair for several reasons,” Jump CEO Ryan Rzepecki wrote in the appeals letter. “Historical issues with individual drivers contracted through Jump’s parent company are not an appropriate comparison to Jump’s much more relevant and compliant e-bike operations and service. Comparing Uber’s ‘ride-hail contractors’ to Jump e-bike or scooter riders compares apples to oranges and is not relevant.” The MTA will hold hearings on the appeals at times still to be determined. On Monday, a Board of Supervisors committee held a hearing on the MTA’s selection process, which Supervisor Ahsha Safai said he had “significant questions” about. The supervisors do not have authority over MTA permitting, however.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Spin-Jump-cry-foul-over-San-Francisco-scooter-13276258.php
Lyft to SF mayor: Give us a chance in e-scooters,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,10,8,"Lyft to SF mayor: Give us a chance in e-scooters. Lyft has written to Mayor London Breed asking her to reconsider the city’s decision to grant only two permits for e-scooter rentals, The Chronicle has learned. The ride-hailing company was among a dozen applicants for a one-year pilot program for app-based rentals of dockless electric scooters in San Francisco. The pilot, run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, called for up to five companies to operate 1,250 scooters in the first six months, with the possibility of doubling the number of vehicles in the second six months. The SFMTA picked two companies, Scoot and Skip, both San Francisco startups, which can start operations next week. Three of the unsuccessful candidates — Lime, Spin and Uber’s Jump— have filed formal appeals over their exclusion. All say they were unfairly blackballed over a clause looking at companies’ past behaviors, and complained that the SFMTA’s scoring seemed arbitrary and biased. As previously reported by The Chronicle, some companies, including Lyft, that scored well on most aspects of the application were dinged over perceived past transgressions. In the case of both Lyft and Jump, those were related to their rollout of ride hailing. Lime and Spin were downgraded for their previous operations of scooters in San Francisco this spring. “Based on information shared by City Hall and SFMTA, Lyft scored the highest on the initial review of the applications because of our concrete proposal to provide a transit-oriented and equitable scooter program to San Francisco,” Lyft wrote. “The fact that the final result differed substantially from the initial analysis is indicative of a larger frustration with the process.” Its specific beefs, which echo those of the three companies filing appeals, were that scoring criteria weren’t released in advance and that the scoring mechanism led to “arbitrary and inconsistent scoring results.” Rather than appealing, Lyft wrote to Breed, as well as to SFMTA Director of Transportation Ed Reiskin, in an effort to be collaborative, the letter said. It asked them to review the scooter application process and consider granting more permits so that Lyft can participate in the pilot. The SFMTA defended its process as “thorough, fair and transparent” and said it is “confident we selected the strongest applicants to participate in the one-year scooter pilot.” Breed’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Both Lyft and Uber increasingly are pursuing mobility beyond cars. Lyft in June bought Motivate, which operates the Ford GoBike rental program in the Bay Area and similar docked bike rentals in other cities. That deal has not yet closed.

Electric scooters rolling back into SF October 15,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,10,10,"Electric scooters rolling back into SF October 15. Major players still on the outs. After months of rolling around in limbo, the popular but divisive app-enabled electric scooters are set to return to the streets of San Francisco on October 15. A spokesperson for Scoot, one of only two outfits that can now legally rent scooters to San Franciscans, tells Curbed SF via email that the company is set to deploy its two-wheeled get-arounds on Monday, with a preview event in the Bayview this Friday. The Bayview locale is perhaps a critical detail, given that the San Francisco Examiner says Scoot will reserve scooter service mostly to eastern neighborhoods, ranging from the Castro to the waterfront but mostly excluding western neighborhoods and the city’s southern flank. [Update: Scoot’s competitor Skip tells Curbed SF via email it’s also set to hit the streets Monday but hasn’t yet defined its own service area. Notably, a company spokesperson says it will have a table at the Excelsior’s Sunday Streets event this weekend to sign up users and give away helmets, after doing similar hubs at Castro, Cole Valley, and Mission sites throughout the week.] SFMTA awarded both companies access to the sweet San Francisco scooter market in August, icing out previously bigger names like Lime, Bird, Spin, Uber, and Lyft, all of whom had vied for the right. The city’s pilot program allows both companies only a few hundred vehicles—1,250 between them—with the potential to double the number in six months. The city cited the “strength of the proposals” presented by Scoot and Skip for their decision, saying at the time that “no other applications substantially exceeded the agency’s standards.” Lime, one of the three companies that set off the e-scooter craze in San Francisco and shortly in major cities across the US, has appealed the city’s decision to tell it to scoot off, alleging “significant bias by the SFMTA, its Director of Transportation, and members of the SFMTA Board of Directors” against the company. Note that although City Hall gossip has it that regulators did indeed resent Lime and its peers for their ambush marketing tactics of throwing vehicles onto SF streets without revealing plans ahead of time, nobody has proven those allegations. Whether they would amount to improper bias if true is a separate question. Either way, beginning Monday the city has two legal purveyors and a relatively small number of scooters to go around, and that’s that, at least for now. What will happen after the one-year pilot also remains to be seen.",https://sf.curbed.com/2018/10/10/17960034/scooters-skip-scoot-return-san-francisco-october
Electric Scooters are Back in San Francisco: Here's What You Need to Know,NBC Bay Area,NBC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,10,19,"Electric Scooters are Back in San Francisco: Here's What You Need to Know. The city's given the green light to a one-year pilot, to figure out if dockless, shared electric ""kick scooters"" deserve a permanent place in the city. What to Know San Francisco banned scooter sharing networks in June after three of them launched without permission The city got thousands of complaints about scooters littering the streets and sidewalks City leaders believe scooters could reduce traffic congestion if done right, so they're doing a limited trial One day in March, they just showed up: Thousands of electric kick scooters, scattered about San Francisco's downtown sidewalks, with labels proclaiming, ""$1 to start!"" To some, it was the latest step in a transportation revolution. To others, it was merely a new form of high-tech blight on the city's crowded streets. ""We certainly saw a lot of people enjoying themselves on the scooters, but we also saw a lot of problems around safety and blocking sidewalks,"" said SFMTA Sustainable Streets Director Tom Maguire. NBC Bay Area The March 2018 onslaught of shared electric scooters in San Francisco left many of the small vehicles strewn across sidewalks where city officials said they were both a safety hazard and an eyesore. A law banning scooter networks without a city permit took effect in June, and faced with tens of thousands of dollars in fines, the three scooter companies — Bird, Lime and Spin — packed up their scooters and left. The city wasn't done with scooters, though. ""We see a quiet, small vehicle like this as something that can really help us solve the problem of traffic congestion in the city,"" Maguire said. Bird, Lime and Spin were among the 12 applicants for a limited pilot program to bring scooters back to San Francisco — but they weren't awarded permits. Instead, the SFMTA gave them to Scoot — which already operates a network of larger electric motor scooters in the city — and Skip, also based in San Francisco, which runs a network of kick scooters it designed in-house in Portland and Washington, D.C. Jonathan Bloom/NBC Bay Area Just like a bicycle, you're supposed to ride San Francisco's new electric scooters in the street -- not on the sidewalk. Here, a Skip employee rides one of the company's new vehicles on Market Street at a public outreach event, encouraging people to try the new scooters -- and to follow the rules. The city received applications from Bird, HOPR, Jump, Lime, Lyft, OFO, Razor, Ridecell, Scoot, Skip, Spin and UScooters. Their applications, now part of the public record, are posted on the SFMTA website. Maguire said the two winning proposals satisfied the city's request to solve safety concerns for both pedestrians and riders — offering free helmets and detailed parking instructions, and warning users not to ride on the sidewalks. Though their scooters look similar, the two companies take very different approaches to managing their fleets. Scoot chose a scooter with a removable battery, and plans to let the vehicles ebb and flow about the city organically — merely sending staff out to swap batteries and repark them when necessary. Jonathan Bloom/NBC Bay Area As part of the San Francisco pilot program, both Skip and Scoot agreed to hold outreach events, teaching customers how to safely ride and park scooters, and offering them free helmets. Both companies said they would continue to offer free helmets by mail to customers who order them. ""We don't have to employ trucks every night to pick up every single scooter and bring them back, and then throw them in trucks every morning and put them back on the sidewalk,"" said Bob Walsh, Scoot's San Francisco general manager. Skip built a scooter with a larger, fixed battery — a range of 20 miles, the company claims — and plans to have ordinary users called ""rangers"" take home scooters to charge them at night in exchange for a $5-per-scooter reward. Skip is also relying on users to ensure safe parking: the Skip app requires you to take a picture of your properly-parked scooter at the end of the ride. ""Riders who consistently park incorrectly can be penalized, and riders who park really well can be rewarded,"" said Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor. Jonathan Bloom/NBC Bay Area The 2018-2019 limited pilot will allow Skip and Scoot to each deploy 625 scooters during the first phase. While the two companies' service areas will overlap, Skip will cover a wider area to the north of downtown, while Scoot will focus more on the densely populated areas south of downtown. For the pilot program, each company is allowed 625 scooters on the streets, with the possibility of another 625 in six months if all goes well. Both companies will serve the downtown, Tenderloin and Bayview districts in their initial rollout. Scoot will cover some additional densely-packed areas to the south including parts of the Dogpatch and Mission districts. Skip has opted to extend its coverage map to the north, including some of the city's hilliest neighborhoods and parts of Golden Gate Park.

E-scooter companies to pay to operate in Oakland,East Bay Times,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,11,1,"E-scooter companies to pay to operate in Oakland. Oakland’s love-hate relationship with e-scooters was blatant at Tuesday night’s City Council meeting where the city approved a set of fines and fees for companies to pay. The fee schedule is part of the overall effort by the city to bring electric scooters out of the legal gray area they’ve been operating in since they touched down in Oakland in March. Three companies — Limebike, Bird Rides and Skip — have dumped thousands of e-scooters on streets and sidewalks despite the city not having regulations in place for them. Like other California cities, Oakland is scrambling to get rules on the books to keep riders safe and reduce the scooters’ financial burden on the city. Several public speakers expressed their aggravation over the scooters, which are commonly left unattended blocking driveways, wheelchair ramps and sidewalks. Other saw the scooters as having a positive impact on the city by reducing the need for cars for short trips. Under the fee schedule passed Tuesday, e-scooter companies must pay a $2,500 fee to apply for a permit, and if approved, a $30,000 annual fee to operate, according to a report from the city administrator’s office. The scooter companies also must pay a $64 per-vehicle annual fee. That money should cover the city’s cost to oversee the scooter programs, said Department of Transportation director Ryan Russo. The estimated cost for city employees to manage and work with the scooter companies to implement the program, crack down on improper parking and purchase the software to track scooter distribution is about $287,500 for the first year, according to the report. With three companies operating 1,000 scooters each, the fees would generate an estimated $289,500 the first year, the report said. The companies also will have to pay a 10-cent-per-ride fee for parking in congested areas of the city, the report said. It’s up to the companies whether to pass that fee on to riders. If a scooter is parked improperly — scooter companies will indicate “proper parking areas” in their permit applications — the firms will be fined $50. In cases where the city would have to confiscate the scooter for safety reasons, the companies would have to pay $140 per hour until the scooter is recovered. The company’s permit could be revoked if confiscated scooters becomes a problem, the report said. City Council President Larry Reid, who harshly criticized the scooter companies last month when the council approved an ordinance allowing city officials to draft the regulations, kept quiet while other council members discussed the fee schedule at Tuesday’s meeting. But when it came time to vote, Reid ripped into the Department of Transportation for apparently trying to “score brownie points” with someone — he didn’t specify who — by giving the companies so much leeway. At the September meeting, Reid — to no avail — pressured the city to outright ban e-scooters until regulations are in place. “Mark my words, you guys should have taken your time, thought this out much clearer and come back to us instead of allowing these people to operate illegally and then come back and try to make them legal,” Reid said. City staff, within weeks, will present regulations for the council to vote on. Those regulations will include a speed limit, a requirement that companies put half their fleet in areas with transportation needs, requirements for safety precautions and a cap on how many scooters a company can have in the city. Limebike East Bay operations manager Tariq Fleming, who spoke at the meeting, said the company is committed to addressing the concerns of residents. “We as a company are committed to the safety of not only our riders, but the city of Oakland,” Fleming said.",https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/11/01/e-scooter-companies-to-pay-to-operate-in-oakland/
Thieves snap up rental scooters in SF,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,11,16,"Thieves snap up rental scooters in SF. Shared electric scooters are disappearing from city streets in high numbers as thieves target the portable vehicles. “In the first two weeks, we lost 200 vehicles to theft, which was just shocking,” said Michael Keating, CEO and founder of San Francisco’s Scoot Networks. “People were grabbing them all the time. We realized that if we kept losing them at that rate, we wouldn’t have any left.” In response, Scoot scaled back its vehicle numbers and expedited its plans to include locks on its two-wheelers. San Francisco’s Skip has also experienced thefts but declined to specify how many. However, its vehicles have a wheel-lock mechanism so they cannot be ridden unless they’re unlocked with an app. Scoot’s two-wheelers can be ridden in manual “kick” mode without using the app — albeit in an unsatisfying experience, as they are not designed for that. Their electric motors require an app unlock to work. Both Skip and Scoot have alarms that go off if scooters are moved without being reserved in their apps. City-sanctioned e-scooter rentals started Oct. 15 under a pilot program in which Scoot and Skip each have permission to rent out up to 625 scooters. Scoot started out offering about 300 scooters but halved that to about 150 a day in recent weeks, something residents have complained about on social media. “We’re not trying to hide that,” Keating said. “The reason is the theft. Ramping up more scooters depends on the success of the lock.” Scoot this week will add combination locks and cables to scooters as an interim measure. Users will get the combination from the app after a scooter is reserved. In early December, Scoot will switch to its long-term solution: built-in electronic locks with 32-inch cables. The smartphone app will unlock the devices. At the end of a ride, the user must lock the scooter to “street furniture,” such as bike rack or pole, and snap a photo of it. Skip has been renting its full complement of 625 scooters and said it has gotten positive rider feedback. Skip also plans to add built-in locks to its fleet and is now testing them out on about a dozen scooters. In addition to thwarting thieves, the locks should help keep more of the scooters out of the flow of pedestrian traffic and prevent people from knocking them over. Skip said it’s working on new technology to detect when scooters are ridden on sidewalks, which is prohibited. “We want people to learn that when they get to the sidewalk, they should pull up the scooter and walk it to the ‘furniture zone,’” said Julie Supan, Skip chief marketing officer, referring to the sidewalk edge where scooters are supposed to be parked. In March, three other scooter companies — Lime, Bird and Spin — burst onto the streets in San Francisco. The scooter deluge led to a temporary ban and then creation of the pilot program. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which oversees scooters, said the number of complaints is much lower now than in the spring. The agency’s 311 line logged 336 scooter-related complaints from Oct. 15 to Nov. 14, or 11.2 a day. In the spring, it received complaints at the rate of 44.6 a day. Scoot’s scooters average two or three rides a day, Keating said. By contrast, Santiago, Chile, where Scoot rolled out scooters around the same time, sees six to 10 rides a day per scooter. That’s because the vehicles there are concentrated in a central business district, while in San Francisco they’re dispersed throughout neighborhoods, he said. Skip declined to say how many rentals it facilitates, but it’s “pleased with usage,” Supan said. Riders use them for first-mile, last-mile connections to transit, as well as for scenic rides such as along the Embarcadero or in Golden Gate Park, she said. Constant theft is clearly not sustainable, Keating said. He declined to say what Scoot pays for its two-wheelers, but industry sources say e-scooters are bought wholesale from China for around $300. Scooter thefts and vandalism are issues in many of the hundreds of cities worldwide that have the two-wheelers. Bird Graveyard, an Instagram account with 60,000 followers, chronicles the sometimes-brutal ways scooters meet their end, such as burning, being thrown off buildings or being tossed in the ocean.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-thieves-grab-e-scooters-at-shocking-rates-13396918.php
San Francisco electric scooters get new security feature,ABC 7 News,ABC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,11,19,"San Francisco electric scooters get new security feature. One of the companies that operates electric scooters in San Francisco is rolling out a new feature to keep the vehicles from disappearing. It seems to be a persistent problem. In the first two weeks since the electric scooters returned to San Francisco, more than 200 were either stolen or severely damaged. To prevent that, Scoot is installing cable locks on the scooters and integrating its use into their app. ""The device will allow the rider to lock the vehicle to a post, to a bike rack, to wherever. And when they turn on the app, it will automatically unlock. And when they park it, they lock it up. They take a picture of it so that we know it is locked and parked correctly,"" said Bob Walsh, general manager for Scoot Networks in San Francisco. The new locking mechanisms will appear on the scooters in early December. Scoot's competitor, Skip, said they have used wheel locks and alarms to deter thefts. They are also looking into locking technology.",https://abc7news.com/4721921/
San Jose mayor to scooter companies: innovate or get out ,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,12,6,"San Jose mayor to scooter companies: innovate or get out. Sam Liccardo wants to see companies use technology like geo-fencing to prevent people from riding on sidewalks. Fed up with scooters crowding San Jose sidewalks, Mayor Sam Liccardo is issuing a somewhat unusual ultimatum to the startups responsible for the deluge of scooters in the city: Innovate or get out. In a memo released Thursday, the mayor and council members Dev Davis and Raul Peralez said scooter companies should use something like geofencing — a virtual perimeter of sorts that notes when riders enter or exit certain boundaries — to prevent riders from zooming down sidewalks and parking unsafely. When someone pushes a shopping cart too far from a grocery store, it locks. Startups such as Bird and Lime, the mayor told reporters at City Hall on Thursday, should build scooters that can similarly detect the difference between a street and a sidewalk and then stop when they’re not where they’re supposed to be. “The technology is certainly available,” Liccardo said. “The question is how it can be implemented, and based on our conversations with scooter companies, we believe now is the time to implement it.” The city, he said, would allow the companies to install sensors on public infrastructure, like poles. “It’ll be too expensive,” said Kevin Larkin, who was unlocking a Bird scooter downtown on Thursday afternoon, shaking his head. Some other cities have been overrun with scooters, Larkin said, but the number in San Jose — about 2,000 by the city’s count — seems manageable. The council members insist they’re not trying to boot scooters altogether. On Wednesday, Liccardo and Davis rode scooters to lunch. “E-scooters are a great solution for that last mile connection in an urban setting,” Davis said in a statement. “We just want to make sure that last mile is safely traveled and people get to their destination without collision or contusions.” “We’re not particular about what or how” the new technology is implemented, Liccardo said. “We just know this is a needed innovation if we’re going to be able to protect pedestrians who have a reasonable expectation that they’ll be safe walking on a sidewalk without being run over.” But while the idea might be feasible, it’s not common. San Jose would be the first city to require such technology, and no scooter companies employ it today. None of the three startups that have scooters in San Jose right now — Bird, Lime, and Wind — responded immediately to requests for comment about the proposal, which is expected to be heard at the City Council meeting on Dec. 18, along with other possible regulations. While other cities such as Seattle have banned scooters, Liccardo said he’d prefer to collaborate. But he’s willing to get rid of the zippy things if they don’t fall in line. “If there is not significant improvement in safety of e-scooters, ultimately bans are coming,” Liccardo said. “There are serious injuries happening out there.” There’s no good count on exactly how many injuries are linked to the scooters. Between January and September of this year, Valley Medical Center saw fewer than 10 accidents involving scooters. But a doctor at San Francisco’s Zuckerberg General Hospital told the New York Times this summer she was seeing five to 10 injuries a week, and at least two people in the U.S. have died riding scooters. And while Liccardo acknowledges the cost of using such technology may get passed along to riders or deter some companies from operating in San Jose, that’s a price he’s willing to pay. “I’ve ridden on e-scooters before,” Liccardo said. “They’re fun, they’re cheap, they’re great, but I think we’d all prefer to be riding in a safe car than simply riding in a cheap car.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/06/san-jose-mayor-to-scooter-companies-innovate-or-get-out/
Lime files appeal; wants scooters back on San Francisco streets,ABC 7 News,ABC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,12,14,"Lime files appeal; wants scooters back on San Francisco streets. After being denied a permit to operate in San Francisco, lawyers for electric scooter company Lime are trying to get the city to change its mind. In a special hearing Friday afternoon, the company is appealing the denial on the grounds that the application process was biased. Before the hearing, employees of Lime and some supporters rallied outside city hall, arguing that the e-scooter company deserves a permit. Lime's Megan Colford said, ""We believe there's an opportunity for the city to answer the voices that are asking for better transportation and better scooter options."" A couple of speakers said Lime could also bring jobs to underserved San Francisco communities. Keith Hazell is a job developer at the Western Addition Success Center. ""It's a great opportunity for our youth to work as mechanics, ambassadors, that type of thing."" Lime was one of three scooter companies that began operating in the city without permission earlier this year. San Francisco issued a cease and desist order and pulled all their scooters off the street based on 2,000 complaints. ""Complaints ranged from scooters blocking the sidewalk, blocking entryways, blocking a public right of way, illegal riding or unsafe riding,"" said Paul Rose of the San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Authority. That's when the city launched a pilot program, allowing two smaller companies to operate-- Scoot and Skip. Since then, only 300 complaints. Lime was denied a permit and in Friday's appeal hearing, their attorneys argued that the application process was weighted against them because of their unorthodox roll out. ""I'm going to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that application process of the pilot share e-scooter program was tainted by bias,"" said Lime attorney Bill Stern. Attorneys for the city say that's just sour grapes. ""This process was fair and according to a fair set of criteria and to a reasoned analysis Lime's application simply did not measure up,"" said Neha Gupta of the San Francisco City Attorneys office. A decision on the appeal is expected sometime in January.",https://abc7news.com/4900785/
E-scooters being dumped into Oakland's Lake Merritt,KTVU,Fox,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2018,12,18,"E-scooters being dumped into Oakland's Lake Merritt. Cheap, portable and fairly unsophisticated to use, electric scooters seemed to explode on Oakland Streets in recent months. While they provide an affordable mode of transportation, they are ending up in places that they do not belong. “We've been having a fair amount of the e-scooters come into the lake or thrown into the lake rather,” said James Robinson, Executive Director of Lake Merritt Institute, which is in charge the lake’s maintenance. These can be very damaging to our marine environment because they're not natural things that go into the lake.” He’s concerned that that the damage is coming from the batteries in scooters, operated by both Lime and Bird. Robinson shared photos with KTVU of scooters that appear to be from both companies submerged in the lake. In October alone, Robinson said 60 e-scooters were pulled from Lake Merritt. Numbers for November are still be counted. “Scooters was not something that I thought that I would be taking out of the lake.” Robinson says the issue has been reported to both ""Lime"" and ""Bird"", but so far only ""Lime"" has sent employees to help remove them. Volunteers armed with nets have also joined the effort to clean the scooters out of Lake Merritt. “If they're very far into the lake, this is very problematic because we have to launch a boat,” Robinson said. “It's sad because you come to work every day and you want to do the best you can for the lake and when you have these scooters being thrown into the lake with seemingly no end in sight, it's very concerning.” Oakland City Council member Rebecca Kaplan led a push to pass an ordinance to develop permits for scooter companies. The Oakland Transportation Department in the process of developing new rules that include banning scooters from being set up along the Lake Merritt running path. KTVU reached out to both Lime and Bird. We did not hear back from Bird, but Lime issued a statement that said they would implement a ""no parking zone"" around Lake Merritt to prevent scooters from being parked near the lake. They also claimed they would donate to the Lake Merritt institute, but they did not disclose any amount. ""Currently, our Lime local operations teams do a daily sweep of the lake for scooters. They remove all scooters they find, regardless of which company it is,"" the company wrote. ""Additionally, each Lime scooter is equipped with GPS, which shows our operations team when a scooter is inside the lake. We immediately deploy our operations teams to collect the scooters when we receive an internal or external report that a scooter is in the lake."" Lime said if a user of their app is found to be responsible that they are removed from their platform. They characterized this type of ""vandalism"" as ""random."" Improperly parked or dumped e-scooters can be reported to Oakland’s non-emergency 311 number or through its online reporting system. Oakland’s transportation department has been holding public input community meetings as they develop a permitting process for e-scooters.",https://www.ktvu.com/news/e-scooters-being-dumped-into-oaklands-lake-merritt
Uber’s Jump may get nod for e-scooters in SF,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,2,5,"Uber’s Jump may get nod for e-scooters in SF. Jump, the e-bike and e-scooter company owned by Uber, got renewed hope Tuesday for its bid to join San Francisco’s scooter cohort, although it didn’t prove that its previous rejection by the city was unfair. Jump was among 10 applicants not selected for the first phase of the city’s pilot program with e-scooters, which started Oct. 15 with two companies, Skip and Scoot, both based in San Francisco. Jump appealed, claiming that the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency was biased against it because of Uber’s perceived misdeeds. An agency hearing officer said the selection process was fair, but recommended that Jump be considered for phase two of the pilot, which starts April 15, and could see the city’s total allotment of scooters doubled to 2,500. “Jump’s record in its stationless bike share program in the city has been exceptional, and as an experienced and well-qualified vendor, I would expect that its stationless e-scooter program would be just as effective,” wrote hearing officer James Doyle. “Allowing additional capable operators to participate in the pilot program will also enhance (its) probability of success.” Jump has rented its bright red free-floating e-bikes in San Francisco since January and now has 500 on city streets, plus 50 in the Presidio. A week ago Doyle issued a similar decision about an appeal by San Francisco startup Spin, which is now owned by Ford Motor Co. He found no bias in the city’s rejection of Spin, but recommended that Spin be considered for the second phase of the pilot program. Another appeal by San Francisco’s Lime is still pending.

Scooter companies tussling with Oakland over who pays for injuries,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,2,20,"Scooter companies tussling with Oakland over who pays for injuries. Electric scooter companies are squaring off with Oakland over who should be liable when a rider gets injured after careening over a bump in the sidewalk, or hitting one of the city’s notorious potholes. City officials want to hold the companies responsible, even for roads that have deteriorated because the city failed to maintain them. But the companies and their allies are fighting back, saying that rutted roads and crumbling pavement shouldn’t be their problem. The argument escalated Wednesday, when representatives of Bird, Lime, Lyft, Razor and Spin sent a letter to the city attorney, mayor and other officials, challenging the language being drawn up for Oakland’s terms and conditions to operate e-scooters in the city. It includes terms that release Oakland from liability for injuries “arising out of, or relating to the design, construction, maintenance, repair, replacement, oversight, management, or supervision of any physical, environmental, or dangerous conditions” of public streets. The companies said these terms are unusual. “Many cities have adopted reasonable indemnification provisions which do not seek to include the city’s own negligence and does notexplicitly carve out the city’s responsibility to riders to maintain the city’s right of way and infrastructure,” they wrote. A spokesman for City Attorney Barbara Parker said Parker would review the letter. He declined to comment further. In the last couple of years, Oakland has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle lawsuits for dangerous conditions on streets and sidewalks. But e-scooters are new terrain. The two-wheeled gadgets have caused scores of accidents since landing on streets throughout the country last year. Toddlers and elderly people have been hit on sidewalks; riders have shown up in emergency rooms with injuries ranging from compound fractures to cranial bleeding. Though the issue has caused mounting concern among physicians, it seems nobody wants to be held at fault. Many companies set up user agreements to insulate themselves from lawsuits, but now cities want to be shielded as well. “Right now the position is, ‘I’m not responsible for anything, you’re responsible for everything,’” said Thom Rickert, vice president and emerging risk specialist at Argo Group, an underwriter of specialty insurance. That mantra holds for both the cities and the companies, he said, and that it’s a common reaction to a new technology that presents a lot of unknowns. Scooters have small wheel bases that could easily be upset by cracks in the sidewalk — and Oakland has plenty of those. Combine that with riders who zip along at high speeds, often without wearing helmets. It’s a recipe for litigation that could eat away the city’s budget. Still, the draft regulations Oakland officials are working on now are more stringent than other cities, Rickert said. San Francisco’s e-scooter permit application includes an indemnity clause that releases the city from liability for most injuries and damages, except those caused by “gross negligence or willful misconduct of the city.” Overall, Oakland has embraced e-scooters, even as other cities recoiled. City Council members called the whizzing devices a fast, reliable mode of transport for people who can’t afford cars. Some officials even touted the e-scooters as a social equalizer that could help in neighborhoods like East Oakland, where BART stations are far apart and bike rental docks end south of the Fruitvale neighborhood border. Yet the e-scooter companies signaled Wednesday that if Oakland doesn’t soften its rules, it might chase out this new form of micro-mobility. Oakland transportation officials would not say when the requirements will be made final. The scooter companies hope to have the regulations solidified this week. “As a policy matter, we appreciate that the city has made the determination that it wants to encourage sustainable micromobility transportation options,” the companies said in their letter to the city. “However, currently the indemnification provision creates a barrier that runs counter to the city’s own policy choices to incorporate emerging mobility technologies into its transportation network.” The head of Jack London Improvement District and the bicycle advocacy group Bike East Bay sent similar letters Wednesday, urging the city to change course. Bike East Bay Advocacy Director Dave Campbell pointed out that no other form of transport shoulders the financial risk for unsafe street design. “Ford and Toyota have no such indemnification requirements, nor does Ford GoBike, privately owned scooters, bicycle manufacturers, AC Transit buses, wheelchair users, shuttle vans, etc.,” he wrote. Savlan Hauser, the executive director of Jack London Improvement District, agreed. She called the regulations particularly harsh because e-scooters are most useful in outer neighborhoods with poorly maintained roads, and few transit options. “We don’t want to make it impossible to have these types of innovations and transportation solutions in our neighborhoods,” Hauser told The Chronicle. “I think there’s a way to work it out.”",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Scooter-companies-tussling-with-Oakland-over-who-13632424.php
San Jose State bans electric scooters from campus,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,2,25,"San Jose State bans electric scooters from campus. Students can ride motorized scooters to campus but must leave in designated zones. San Jose State students who are running late to class can no longer rely on electric scooters to zip across campus. The San Jose State University Police Department announced Monday a new policy banning the use of electric and motorized scooters, effective immediately. Electric and motorized skateboards and bicycles are also banned. “Self propelled” scooters and skateboards are allowed. People can still ride bicycles on campus but must adhere to the 5 mph speed limit. “The reasons for the new regulations are vast but as you can imagine, we have (had) collisions, trips and falls, and blocking of fire exits,” San Jose State university police said in a statement posted online. “This is a small list of reasons why SJSU has set these new regulations.” On Monday, the university confiscated 81 motorized scooters, said university Vice President of Administration and Finance Charlie Faas, adding that Lime and Bird will have to pay to get them back. The policy was inspired in part by the 100 or so calls university police have received about the scooters over the past six to nine months, Faas said. “This needs to be as much as possible a walking campus,” he said. “We have 90 acres. We have 40,000 people inhabiting those 90 acres. That’s the smallest footprint in the California State University system and the highest ratio of people to acres.” Faas said the policy is also a response to riders leaving the scooters on walkways and in front of doors. “It’s hard to get around and get into buildings that people need to get into and have a right to get into,” he said. In a statement, Lime spokesman Joe Arellano said the company has “messaging embedded in our app that alerts riders. We have also created ‘geofenced’ areas in our system that create no parking and no service zones on campus, and preferred parking zones where riders should park on campus. “Lime is also planning a pop-up event alongside the campus police department next week to hand out helmets and make students aware of the new scooter dismount policy and the preferred parking areas on campus.” Bird, another electric scooter company, “has been working closely with university officials and proactively communicating to our riders about this new policy. We have implemented no-ride and no-parking zones on campus, and have provided information about the ban to all Bird riders on and near campus,” the company said in an email. University police said students who are caught using the motorized modes of transportation will be given warnings to start, followed by citations. “We know that this is will be a steep learning curve so we will be gradually ramping up our enforcement,” university police said in a statement posted to Twitter. “There will be signage around that should be pretty easy to understand.” Monday morning there were a handful of the Lime (black with green trim) and Bird (black with white trim) scooters parked across the San Jose State campus, and dozens more resting on surrounding streets. At least three students were seen riding the motorized scooters through the heart of campus. Senior Chioma Lewis, 21, a journalism major at SJSU, was one of several students spotted on campus Monday with a kick scooter. Lewis said while she primarily relies on a kick scooter to get around on campus, she has used motorized ones as well. The kick scooter “gets me where I need to go and I don’t have to pay for it,” Lewis said. “But the motorized ones really get you from point A to point B in under a minute. And it’s very cheap.” “And it’s also fun. I think that’s a big thing for students. It’s fun to ride it.” Lewis said she wasn’t surprised by the university’s decision to ban motorized scooters. She said scooters have been parked in the middle of walkways, stacked on top of one another and found sitting in garbage cans. “And when people are walking, you have other people zooming in and out” on the motorized scooters, Lewis added. William Boggini, a junior speech pathology major, was riding a white Razor kick scooter Monday and was aware of the campus ban on motorized scooters. Boggini said he opposes the ban, saying motorized scooters are easy to ride and a convenient way to get to class. “I think that [the scooters] makes it a lot more convenient to get to class, especially if you’re in a rush to get somewhere,” Boggini said. “They’re pretty quick and easy to ride. But now with the new ban, you’re not allowed to technically have them on campus “I think it’s really kind of inconvenient because, especially for people living off campus, if they ride a scooter, once they get onto campus, they basically have to park it and walk the rest of the way.” Faas hasn’t ridden a motorized scooter, saying he prefers to walk where he needs to go. But he is fan of the technology. “I love the thought process,” he said. “What we’re looking to do is get people to use them as they were meant to be used, use them responsibly.” The university police department said Lime, one of the companies that operates motorized scooters in San Jose, “has already implemented a warning that will sound on your mobile device to alert you that you are in violation if you are on SJSU.” The university said it is working with Bird, another operator of motorized scooters, to implement a similar warning system. Last year, the pay-as-you-go motorized scooters began appearing in and around downtown San Jose almost overnight. In December, the San Jose City Council passed an ordinance aimed at regulating the motorized scooters operating on city streets. Companies that operate motorized scooters in San Jose now must get a permit, pay an annual permit application fee of $2,500 and submit another $124 per device each year to operate. Faas noted that the university went through something similar with bicycles years ago. “They figured out the bike thing,” he said. “Now they’ll figure out the scooter thing.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/02/25/san-jose-state-bans-electric-scooters-from-campus/

After a number of collisions and safety issues and a reported 100 calls to campus police, San Jose State University banned electric scooters on its campus for the foreseeable future, the school said Monday. But first, campus police rounded up all the scooters already on campus and put them in what could only be described as scooter jail. ""These were seized from walkways and interior areas of campus,"" San Jose State police wrote on Twitter Monday. ""These will be given back once claimed by their respective company reps."" ""'Scoot and release' is a catchy term (pun intended),"" they added. And there will be bail: SJSU Vice President of Administration and Finance Charlie Faas told the Mercury News the companies will have to pay to reclaim the scooters. He said the school's concerns include people parking the scooters in places that block walkways and fire exits. Electric and motorized skateboards and bikes are also banned under the new policy. One person on Twitter thought the college didn't have the legal authority to ban the scooters, replying that the school was public property. In response, SJSU police pointed to a section of the California Vehicle Code stating that, with some exceptions, ""A person shall not drive a vehicle or animal, or stop, park, or leave standing a vehicle or animal, whether attended or unattended, upon the driveways, paths, parking facilities, or the grounds"" of places that include public schools and state universities. Late last year, the San Jose city council passed rules regulating scooter companies in the city and requiring them to pay annual permitting fees of $2,500 plus an additional $124 for each scooter being operated.

How long do those electric scooters actually last? ,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,3,2,"How long do those electric scooters actually last? An analysis by Quartz estimated Bird scooters in Louisville, Ky lasted less than a month. Love them or hate them, if you’ve been outside recently you probably have strong opinions about electric scooters — maybe stronger than the scooters themselves, at least in Louisville, Ky. Bird scooters in Louisville only lasted about 28.8 days and each earned the company an estimated $3.32 in net revenue per day, according to an analysis by the economics website Quartz of data posted by the city. A spokeswoman for Bird told the website that the data, part of Louisville’s open data initiative, didn’t paint a complete picture. “We have a dynamic fleet, move vehicles around, etc.,” Rebecca Hahn told Quartz in an email. “Just because it looks like it was in Louisville for 28 days does not mean that was its entire lifespan.” On Twitter, “transport enthusiast” Nathan Stevens found that, according to the data, each scooter was used on average 3.49 times per day, with each ride lasting an average of 18 minutes and going 1.6 miles. Stevens also found one “super scooter” that worked for 257 rides and 493 miles — roughly equivalent to riding from San Francisco to San Diego. Bird aims to pay roughly $360 per scooter, so using that plus estimates of charging costs, Louisville’s fees and more, Quartz predicted Bird lost at least $293 per scooter. The original Bird scooters were from Xiamoi and intended for one user weighing 200 lbs, about 2 lbs above the average weight for an American man, according to Quartz. The company recently announced a new generation of scooters specifically designed for shared use. Shared electric scooters have come under some regulatory scrutiny recently, including a ban at San Jose State. In San Jose, the city council passed an ordinance requiring companies to get a permit, pay an annual permit application fee of $2,500 and submit another $124 per device each year to operate. They’ll also have to obtain insurance and protect the city from legal claims. The mayor also suggested requiring geofencing technology to keep scooters off of sidewalks.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/01/how-long-do-those-electric-scooters-actually-last/
San Francisco finds controlled scooter pilot a success,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,4,12,"San Francisco finds controlled scooter pilot a success. San Francisco officials, who rejected electric scooters after an unruly, unlicensed rollout a year ago, are now cottoning to the two-wheel devices under a yearlong trial that limits their numbers. Midway through that trial, the city is poised to consider next week whether to double the number of street-rented scooters it allows. The free-for-all when three companies suddenly unleashed the rental devices last spring led to thousands of residents hopping aboard, and also triggered thousands of complaints. Scooter riders zoomed down sidewalks and bike lanes and weaved in and out of crowds. Abandoned devices sprawled across rights of way or were tossed into trash cans and in front of Google buses. The city temporarily banned scooters while it considered what to do. The clampdown was partially lifted under the pilot that started Oct. 15. Two San Francisco startups, Scoot and Skip, have permission to rent 625 devices apiece, although most days Scoot offered far fewer. Usage of both companies’ vehicles plunged during the rainy winter months, making scooter sightings sporadic. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which oversees the pilot, next week will decide whether to increase the scooter allotment to 2,500 for the next six months. Tom Maguire, the agency’s director of sustainable streets, declined to say if staff will recommend that. However, he said, even if it allows more scooters, the agency is likely to stick with a directive issued in August limiting the pilot to two companies. “We’re encouraged by how it’s going,” Maguire said. “We’ve seen the positives of moving from a Wild West scenario to some appropriate local regulations — a decrease in sidewalk riding and illegal parking on sidewalks.” Several spurned operators, including Spin, Lime and Uber’s Jump, had appealed their rejections, while Lyft wrote letters asking for reconsideration. All had hopes of being tapped for the program’s second half. From riders’ perspective, fewer scooters makes the rentals less useful, according to people who attended a public workshop held by the agency this month. “I used to use them and loved them — then they disappeared,” said Soni Mehra. “It’s harder and harder to find them now, so I can’t rely on them to get to work.” Both Scoot and Skip said they’d be happy to increase their fleets, especially now that they’ve ironed out some kinks — notably preventing theft and deterring some vandalism by adding built-in locks to all scooters as of early February. Locks also ensure that parked scooters aren’t tipped over and don’t block sidewalks, curb cuts or crosswalks as they have to be affixed to bike racks or posts. “The locking is key,” Maguire said. “We’re the first city in the country that has all our scooters lockable.” Complaints about improper parking have plunged since the locks were implemented, he said. Scoot had only a fraction of its allotment on streets for the program’s initial months because theft was so rampant, but now is bringing its numbers up. “We had a rough start with all the theft and vandalism and then a terribly rainy few months,” said Michael Keating, Scoot CEO. “We want to show that this can be done safely, respectfully and sustainably.” Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor has the same goals. Both executives said it’s clear that demand currently exceeds supply. So how many scooters could San Francisco accommodate without returning to last year’s chaos? “That’s a key question — how to expand the program without it being overwhelming,” Dastoor said. “Even doubling the number won’t create the level of reliability that residents and visitors expect to be able to depend on this as a mode of transportation.” Keating said, “We think the city should continue to increase the number allowed until it’s clear they’re not being ridden that much. I don’t think anyone knows what the maximum number should be.” Both companies and the MTA say they’re encouraged that scooter riders say they often turn to the devices to replace car trips. “People are using this in a way we think improves the city,” Dastoor said. Of some 1,700 riders polled earlier this year, 36% said otherwise they would have taken Uber or Lyft, while 5% said they’d have driven alone. Of the rest, 31% would have walked, 11% would have used public transit, 9% would have biked and 8% were “other.” On their most-recent trip, 34% of respondents used scooters to get to or from public transportation, the transportation agency noted. Its conclusion: “Scooters induce transit trips at roughly four times the rate that they replace transit trips, indicating that they could complement transit by serving as a valuable last-mile connection.” The MTA still wants more outreach to low-income riders. Fewer than 1% of scooter users take advantage of an “equity access” program to subsidize rides for low-income residents, even though about 9% would qualify. Regular rentals cost $1 to unlock plus 15 cents a minute; subsidized rides are half price. The survey did reinforce some stereotypes about who rides scooters. Respondents were overwhelming male (82%), white (63%) and affluent (68% had household incomes above $100,000).",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-finds-controlled-scooter-pilot-a-success-13764061.php
"SF to boost e-scooter rentals to 1,600, with option to grow to 2,500",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,4,15,"SF to boost e-scooter rentals to 1,600, with option to grow to 2,500. San Francisco will modestly expand the number of rental e-scooters allowed on city streets with an option to eventually double the total complement to 2,500 if scooter operators sign up additional low-income riders. Starting immediately, Scoot and Skip, the two San Francisco startups with permits to operate here, can each add 175 scooters to their fleets, which currently number 625 per company. As part of that permission, each operator must recruit at least 150 riders for a program that provides half-price ridership for low-income people. Once either company boosts its low-income riders to 500 members, it can rent out an additional 450 scooters. If both do so, that would bring the number in San Francisco to 2,500, the maximum allowed by the yearlong pilot program that started Oct. 15. Currently Scoot has 68 low-income riders and Skip has 78, according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which oversees the pilot. “That’s not sufficient for what we want to see in San Francisco for an equitable program,” said Jamie Parks, SFMTA director of livable streets. “That’s why we’ve pushed them to increase the number of low-income riders.” A survey of about 1,700 scooter riders found that they are disproportionately male (82 percent), white (63 percent) and affluent (68 percent with household incomes over $100,000). The SFMTA is requiring that each company offer at least 450 devices a day for 25 out of 30 consecutive days. That appears aimed at Scoot, which for several months held back many of its scooters from rental because of rampant theft. Both Scoot and Skip now have built-in locks, which deter theft and help ensure proper parking. San Francisco is the first city where all rental e-scooters have locks. In addition, Scoot and Skip must implement processes for resolving safety complaints and must increase rider education around safety, especially helmet use and the ban on sidewalk riding. California passed a law last year that allows adults to ride e-scooters without helmets. “Even though the law has changed, we feel it’s a very good idea to wear a helmet, and we’re asking operators to help do that,” Parks said. Overall, the agency is pleased by the scooter pilot, which was developed to control the two-wheelers after several companies, Bird, Lime and Spin, unleashed thousands of them here a year ago, leading to a temporary ban. “We’re really encouraged that over 40 percent of riders said if not for scooters, they would have driven or taken Uber or Lyft — that’s a direct shift from cars encouraging pollution to a much more low-impact form of travel,” said Tom Maguire, SFMTA director of sustainable streets. Not all San Franciscans embrace the scooter phenomenon. Nancy Thompson, who’s lived on Telegraph Hill for 32 years, said she considers them an ongoing problem. “People ride them on the sidewalks and zip through stop signs,” she said. “If you tell them that it’s illegal to ride on sidewalks, they say nasty things. It’s very inconsiderate.” Once the pilot concludes in mid-October, San Francisco will implement a new structure for scooter rentals based on feedback from the pilot. The transportation agency is working to create a new permit application before then, so that the rollout can occur more quickly. A dozen companies had vied to be part of the pilot program. Several of the spurned candidates, including Lime, Ford’s Spin and Uber’s Jump, appealed their rejections and had hoped to be considered for the pilot’s second half. The agency said it is sticking with its original decision to limit the pilot to two companies.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-to-add-350-e-scooters-with-option-for-900-more-13769160.php

Banned Bird scooters return to San Francisco,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,5,1,"Banned Bird scooters return to San Francisco. Scooter startup’s rental program skirts city rules. Santa Monica-based electronic scooter startup Bird is available in some 100 cities worldwide, but remains banned in San Francisco after City Hall brought down the hammer on the company—and its competitors, Lime and Spin—in reprisal for guerilla-style launch tactics in the spring of 2018. Now Bird returns to perform another end-run on the rules with a new program that will put its scooters back on SF streets. On Tuesday, Bird announced that riders in two cities—Barcelona and San Francisco—will be able to rent scooters on a monthly basis instead of the usual per-minute rate. According to the company’s public announcement: Available soon in San Francisco and Barcelona, people can open the Bird app and enter information such as where and when they would like their Bird delivered (home, work, or elsewhere). After your order is placed, a Bird representative will follow up to confirm details and arrange for a personal Bird, charger, and lock to be delivered. When your rental period expires, Bird will come and pick up the vehicle, charger, and lock from your location. [...] Affordable and reliable transportation is an issue challenging city residents everywhere. In San Francisco, it is especially out of reach for the most vulnerable members of the community. The Bird rental page says that customers can rent in San Francisco for $24.99 per month; the company qualifies the offer as “landing soon” and has a waitlist for interested riders. Under the rules of the city’s scooter pilot program, only two companies, Scoot and Skip, may operate on city byways. However, the new Bird rental program skates by those rules, because renters will now store Bird’s scooters at their homes and the micromobility devices will not be available to rent on sidewalks. The only time people will see the scooters in public is when users are actively riding them. SFMTA spokesperson Paul Rose tells Curbed SF “we are going to get more details to determine whether or not it complies with existing regulation.” Presently, the city allows two companies to rent 1,250 scooters on city streets. That number may double in coming months, but only if scooter companies can meet City Hall’s demands that it make scooters more widely available to low-income riders. According to SFMTA’s “Powered Scooter Share Mid-Pilot Evaluation” report, public “complaints about sidewalk riding and improper storage were significantly reduced” after city regulation. “Between October 15, 2018 and February 28, 2019, the SFMTA received 624 complaints of improperly parked scooters,” according to the report, whereas San Franciscans piled up “nearly 2,000 complaints [...] during a two month period in spring 2018.” The transit agency also acknowledges that “demand for powered shared scooters is strong.”",https://sf.curbed.com/2019/5/1/18525719/banned-bird-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-loophole
California Assembly Wants Electric Scooter Regulation,NBC Bay Area,NBC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,5,20,"California Assembly Wants Electric Scooter Regulation. The California Assembly has approved new rules for electric bikes and scooters. Businesses like Bird and Spin have deployed scooters to cities across California and the country in recent years. Often local governments have not set up permits or regulations for the devices. A bill passed by the Assembly on Monday would require electric bike and scooter companies to get permits from cities. It would also require them to agree to rules for parking, maintenance and safety. Democratic Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, the bill's author, says while electric bikes are a fun and eco-friendly mode of transportation.

"It's the Cars, Stupid: Scooter Controversy Conceals City's Inertia on Car Culture - Pedestrian Observations ",Bay City Beacon,,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,6,3,"It's the Cars, Stupid: Scooter Controversy Conceals City's Inertia on Car Culture - Pedestrian Observations. San Francisco thinks it has a problem with dockless scooters. These are a new phenomenon in the city, coming on the heels of dockless bike share, a 2016-7 Chinese invention that, unlike traditional bike share systems like San Francisco's Ford GoBike, allows bikes to be located anywhere, without specified corral locations. The result of dockless bike share was revolutionary: by the end of 2017 Beijing had 2.35 million bikes, one per nine residents, and one of the providers, MoBike, claims cycling's mode share doubled. These firms have since entered the United States, spawning some local startups as well, and subsequently, some firms have begun providing dockless electric scooters. These look much like the more familiar unpowered scooters but have small electric motors to boost speed, allowing people to go about at running speed rather than walking speed. Led by District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin, the Board of Supervisors is getting closer to regulating them out of existence, for no apparent reason other than they are a new mode of transportation competing for road space with precious cars. The Boards' recently-passed ordinance, going into effect on June 4th, limits the number of companies renting electric scooters to five, with a maximum of 500 scooters per company. Moreover, it charges a $5,000 application fee and a $25,000 annual permit fee on top of that. Peskin has not given any compelling reason for why these limits are necessary, but complaints against the scooters include clutter, perceived danger to pedestrians, and dissatisfaction with private businesses in general. Slate quotes the City Attorney's office saying the scooters are a hazard. But are they? The top speed of an electric scooter is 15 miles per hour. A healthy adult can hit that speed while running to make a bus: high school track competitions around the country have minimum qualifying times for boys and girls that require somewhat higher average speeds over a 200 meter sprint. Here are the California standards: 15 miles per hour over 200 meters correspond to 30 seconds. Moreover, scooters weigh very little. One model is quoted at 35 pounds. Another is 16.5 pounds. A third weighs 20 pounds. Even the heavier scooters weigh far less than a human. This means that, for all intents and purposes, the risk of a collision between an electric scooter and a pedestrian is similar to the risk of a collision between a pedestrian running on the sidewalk and a standing pedestrian. Unsurprisingly, the City Attorney's office could not find a single example of a serious injury coming from powered scooters. The worst it could cite was “a report of an injury of a broken toe after tripping on a scooter that was lying on the sidewalk”; scooters are far from the only thing lying on the sidewalk, leading former reporter and local YIMBY Action activist Joe Rivano Barros to tweet photos of cars entirely blocking the sidewalk. Of course, the private sector’s available platforms are far from perfect. Despite the low risk of powered scooters, Lime insists that people using its electric scooters have valid drivers' licenses, locking out people who do not know how to drive. Lime also requires riders to be at least 18 years old, locking out children from car alternatives in a city that otherwise assumes respectable middle-class people own cars. Alex Baca is the former manager of Cleveland's small docked bike share system. She has grown interested in the ability of dockless bike share to improve on traditional systems, in particular because each bike reportedly costs $200-400 whereas in Cleveland, Baca told us that each individual bike cost $2,500, and the support systems (such as the docks) added a good deal more. Baca said that the scooters weren't a threat to pedestrians, but if they were, the city could dedicate a portion of the street to their use—scooter lanes, in other words. After all, cars are far more dangerous, polluting to boot, and require the owner to shell out $25,000, out of reach for many people, whereas electric scooters sell for a few hundred dollars per unit, and yet it's uncontroversial to give them primary use of the majority of the city's street space. The real problem is not clutter or safety. When Aaron Peskin is calling the executives of the companies providing these vehicles “spoiled brats,” he is sending a clear message: if you want to provide transportation within the city of San Francisco, you must provide cars. Cars do not clutter the sidewalks, perhaps because the majority of the width of nearly every street is given to cars in preference to pedestrians. Auto companies made windfall profits while pedestrians as well as car occupants were killed and maimed in accidents, but their executives acted like midcentury American (or increasingly German and Japanese) business executives and not like 21st-century tech moguls, so they're not so offensive to the sensibility of San Francisco progressives. City Hall thinks it's sending a message to new businesses to behave, but the message they are likely to hear is different: buy ExxonMobil stock. People with money to invest can buy the stock of firms in mature industries, with predictable tax rates and, owing to global inaction on climate change, predictable regulations. Exxon's investors can expect a decent return after taxes. People who instead want to invest money in alternative transportation need to guess whether the city will decide to flex its muscles and levy unnecessary fees and limit the scope of their systems. Some technologies lend themselves better to public-sector action, like public transit. Dockless is not such a technology: it was invented by private actors, and thrives even in the presence of widespread competition (Beijing has 15 operators, each with its own app). It's not something the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could have developed itself, and so far it seems uninterested in even trying to municipalize it the way the city created Muni a hundred years ago. Instead of asking why dockless bike share was invented in China and not in the supposedly more entrepreneurial Bay Area, San Francisco's politicians are trying to preserve the City’s car-dependent status quo, with all its contributions to climate change and traffic deaths virtually untouched.",https://www.thebaycitybeacon.com/politics/its-the-cars-stupid-scooter-controversy-conceals-citys-inertia-on-car-culture---pedestrian/article_5fb0d3e8-6755-11e8-bf3f-4733cb5c7e73.html
Mountain View to motorized scooter companies: not so fast ,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,6,26,"Mountain View to motorized scooter companies: not so fast. City officials are concerned about parking and sidewalk riding. Citing serious safety issues caused by electric scooters in cities across the Bay Area, Mountain View has decided to temporarily ban the devices. Although the city plans to launch a pilot program in early 2020, city staff says the ban will give them time to determine how to regulate the e-scooter operators moving forward. “The temporary moratorium gives us the opportunity to craft regulations to address issues that we’ve heard other cities have experienced,” Mayor Lisa Matichak said in an interview. “In particular, I want to make sure the scooters are parked in areas where they don’t pose a hazard to others.” The Mountain View City Council voted 6-1 Tuesday night to enact a temporary ban on “shared mobility devices”, including bicycles, electric bicycles and motorized scooters. Councilmember John McAlister dissented. Shared mobility programs that are already offered within the city limits, such as the bicycles Google provides for its employees, will be exempt from the ban. “In the absence of regulation, shared mobility device operations present serious concerns related to parking, sidewalk riding, user behavior, equipment standards, and maintenance that negatively affect public peace, safety, and health,” a city staff report states. The council’s decision came several months after e-scooter operator Bird applied for a city business license and several other e-scooter and bicycle share operators — Lime, Gotcha, Spin and Jump — inquired about launching their devices within the city, according to Dawn Cameron, the city’s assistant public works director. Over the last couple of years, interest and ridership in e-scooters has soared. In 2018, 38.5 million trips were made on e-scooter shares across the U.S. — topping the number of trips made on city-sponsored bike shares for the first time, according to an analysis by the National Association of City Transportation Officials. In May 2018, Mountain View launched a bike share pilot program and awarded permits to Chinese-owned startup, ofo, and Bay Area startup, Lime. Both operators, however, withdrew from the pilot program before the end due to “shifting business plans and volatility in the device-sharing industry,” according to a city staff report. Lime, for instance, announced its withdrawal from bike share in nearly all Bay Area cities in order to shift toward scooters. City staff plans to present the city council with an evaluation of the bike share pilot program in the fall and then launch an e-scooter program in early 2020. The ban will remain in effect until a pilot program is launched. Operators that violate the ban and deploy scooters or bikes within the city will be contacted and asked to remove their devices from the city, according to the ordinance. Mountain View is not the first city in the Bay Area to take this approach. In January, Santa Clara adopted a temporary ban, after receiving an email from Bird indicating that the company planned to deploy scooters on city streets. In late 2018, San Jose passed regulations to limit scooter speed to 12 mph, provide customer support in multiple languages and offer discounts to low-income residents. Although the city allowed operators like Wind, Lime, and Bird to deploy e-scooters before regulations were put in place, the city officially awarded its first and only e-scooter permit in June to Lyft. In March, Palo Alto extended its bike and e-scooter pilot program for another year, but it has not issued any permits yet, according to Lisa Caracciolo, the city’s communications manager.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/26/mountain-view-to-motorized-scooter-companies-not-so-fast/

RELATED: E-scooters to blame for at least 1,500 injuries last year The story follows the same trajectory as so many gig economy jobs. Shiny new opportunities pay out large sums to attract a workforce, then rates are cut once there are enough workers to sustain the model. Other companies trying to compete in the same area do the same thing. It’s unclear whether the introduction of newcomer scooter companies will create a charging renaissance in which prices once again rise – Lyft plans to roll out scooters in Oakland this week. The annoyances that plague chargers are many, and don’t seem to have changed much in the time since the charging scene got started: scooter hoarders, who scoop up scooters without checking them in and wait for the prices to rise before they scan them and charge them, gaming the fact that bounties increase the longer scooters remain in the wild; ghost scooters that show up on the map only to be nonexistent when chargers show up to collect them; uneven bounties that chargers speculate are intended to nudge them towards particular areas (Alameda-based chargers often find themselves incentivized to drive to Oakland, for instance). Charging can be a costlier job in the Bay Area than in many other markets where the scooters operate, like, say, Austin, because associated costs such as gas make this a tough place to own an ideal Bird-hunting vehicle like a pickup truck. (SFGATE reached out to multiple scooter companies but none provided the range of bounties currently available to chargers in the Bay Area). ""I bought a van last year, because the money was good, now I'm struggling to pay my bills,"" one Bay Area charger wrote on Reddit this week. Then there are the dangers. Internet forums for scooter chargers are rife with accounts of people carrying weapons to defend themselves and their scooter bounties while charging. The competition can get heated. Scooters have been used to set traps for robberies, the Atlantic described in a 2018 feature. Carrying the scooters can cause back strain. They can get perilously slippery in the rain (some companies have an inclement weather mode, but it’s not always activated when things are just a little rainy, chargers say). In April, Lime tried to cut back on the competition over scooters by beta testing a feature in three markets (Oakland was one of them) that allowed chargers to reserve a scooter before going to pick it up. But some users complain they’ve had rival chargers make off with their reserved scooters without scanning them into the app — reservation be damned. Adjustments are a race against people seeking to game the bounty system, and the scooters, electric though they may be, can only move so fast.",https://www.sfgate.com/travel/resources/transit/article/messy-work-charging-electric-scooters-Bird-Lime-14067322.php
SFMTA board votes to make e-scooter program permanent,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,7,16,"SFMTA board votes to make e-scooter program permanent. The electric scooter craze that took over San Francisco streets last year may become permanent, the city’s transportation board decided Tuesday. In a 4-2 vote, board directors for the Municipal Transportation Agency ended an 18-month pilot program that allowed two companies, Skip and Scoot, to operate 2,500 two-wheeled vehicles on city streets. Directors removed that cap and invited e-scooter companies to apply for permits annually. Incoming transportation chief Tom Maguire will determine how many permits to dole out each year. Some board directors said they aren’t fully sold on e-scooters as a new way of getting around. “I’m a skeptic about these scooters, period,” said Director Steve Heminger, one of the “no” votes. “They seem to be a solution in search of a problem.” He suspected that a lot of people use e-scooters instead of walking. Director Cheryl Brinkman supported the new e-scooter program but said she doubts the technology has real staying power, especially given that the companies aren’t generating a profit, she said. Yet other directors countered that e-scooters provide an environmentally friendly form of transport for people who might otherwise hail an Uber or Lyft car. And cutting into the ride-hail industry means fewer distracted drivers on the road, said SFMTA director Ed Reiskin, who will step down next month. E-scooters are “probably better than a car driven by someone who doesn’t know where they’re going, who is staring (down) at an app, looking for fares,” he said. The new e-scooter rules require the devices to have built-in locks to deter theft, a new permit fee schedule and a new fine structure for e-scooters that are inappropriately stashed on the sidewalk, among other things. SFMTA will issue new permits by Oct. 15.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SFMTA-board-votes-to-make-e-scooter-program-14101031.php
San Francisco makes e-scooters permanent,Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,7,17," San Francisco makes e-scooters permanent. “What are we doing to keep these off the sidewalks?” San Francisco’s pilot scooter program is a pilot no more, as the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) Board of Directors voted Tuesday to make e-scooters a permanent addition to city streets. When the one-year pilot instituted last year expires on October 15, a permanent scooter program will replace it. The text of the measure includes: Amending the Transportation Code to modify existing Powered Scooter Share Permit Program requirements to, among other things, remove the limitations of the pilot program, authorize the Director to determine the appropriate number of permitted scooters and permittees, require that powered scooters have integrated lock-to devices, revise distribution and rebalancing requirements, update data sharing terms, adjust the permit fee schedule and endowment fund amounts. This could mean a lot of new vehicles and new scooter companies around SF—and it could also mean new regulations on scooter-slinging operations. Jason Hyde, the SFMTA planner who oversees the scooter pilot, told SFMTA directors Tuesday that the agency is mulling a variety of new rules, including requiring scooter purveyors to maintain a 24-hour call center for complaints, keeping a shared complaint database, and “alignment of fines and fees with stationless bikeshare.” Hyde says that in the future the city, rather than the companies, will do more to decide in which areas of the city companies should make scooters available. “We need to be more prescriptive about our service area [...to] prevent a clustering of devices downtown,” Hyde said Tuesday. “It’s likely the public is served better by a smaller rather than a larger number of operators,” SFMTA’s sustainability manager Tom McGuire told the board. Some board members praised the results of the pilot, with Director Cheryl Brinkman noting that in Oakland “the scooter litter around some of the BART stations is breathtaking” compared to the city. Brinkman added, “If we could have done the same thing for TNCs [we have for scooters], what a different world.” Director Art Torres was more skeptical, asking, “What are we doing to keep these off the sidewalks?” calling that the number one public concern about scooter tech. “Enforcement is always the key,” Torres added. “Be careful when you say you’re going to get this under control, because it hasn’t happened.” Despite the misgivings, the vote carried 5-2.",https://sf.curbed.com/2019/7/17/20698223/san-francisco-makes-e-scooters-permanent
Is that scooter supposed to be there? We asked SFMTA,SFGATE,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,8,12,"Is that scooter supposed to be there? We asked SFMTA. Renting an electric scooter in the city sounds simple enough: download an app, provide a little information, scan a code and you are off. But then series of potentially paralyzing questions come: Can I use the sidewalks? Do I need a helmet? Is this device approved by the city? Judging by the number people weaving between pedestrians on the sidewalks along the Embarcadero, the answers to these questions are not widely known. Lawmakers have scrambled to catch up to the new technology since piles of the devices began appearing on San Francisco sidewalks in early 2018. The city had to temporarily ban them all last June after an unruly roll-out and only allowed them back after approval of a pilot program limited to two companies, Skip and Scoot. Since then the devices tend to be neatly locked up rather than tossed in the most inconvenient places possible. If you don't remember what that was like, here are some troubling photos from early 2018: But what do regulations say about where you are allowed to ride your Scoot? Does a scooter belong in that green protected bike lane or on the sidewalk? The San Francisco Municipal Transit Authority was very clear about the answer. ""Electric scooters are allowed on all roadways that regular bicycles are allowed to use,"" said SFMTA media officer Ben Barnett. ""They are also allowed on all bike paths and are encouraged to use them."" Cyclists routinely gripe about frequent obstructions in their protected lanes, but the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition's official position is to welcome their electrified friends in an attempt to make streets safer for everyone. ""San Francisco Bicycle Coalition supports the lawful use of scooters,"" said representative Melissa Lewis. ""That means that scooters are welcome in bike lanes. We encourage people on scooters to ride predictably and respectfully."" That means people riding on sidewalks - predictably or not - shouldn't be. Sidewalk riders are actually guilty of a moving violation, and could theoretically be cited by SFPD. They won't be fined for riding without a helmet, though; those are recommended but not required in the city. Barnett says the city is constantly evaluating such ""emerging modes of transportation"" and may add in new regulations in the future.",https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/can-scooters-go-in-the-bike-lane-San-Francisco-14297938.php
"Up to 2,500 scooters hit SF streets as politicians push for stricter rules",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,10,16,"Up to 2,500 scooters hit SF streets as politicians push for stricter rules. After a ban, a reprieve and 18 contentious months of debate, San Francisco will see the number of electric rental scooters in town possibly double to as many as 2,500 Tuesday, as three new providers add their fleets to the street. Under an expansion of the city’s current pilot program, scooters from operators Lime, Jump and Spin will join those of Scoot, which gained permission to place its devices on streets after the city cracked down on scooters in early 2018. Scoot can deploy up to 1,000 scooters, about 400 more than its current number. Under their permits, Lime, Jump (owned by Uber) and Spin (owned by Ford) can each deploy up to 500 scooters. That number can increase up to 750 by Dec. 15 and to 1,000 by Feb. 15 if they meet requirements. One current scooter operator, Skip, will lose its license. Lime and Spin were among three operators that were banned last year after putting the vehicles on the street without seeking city approval. The other was Bird, which went on to acquire Scoot. The expansion of scooter rentals comes after a year and a half of debate over the electric devices, which came to symbolize a freewheeling attitude toward rolling out new technology that exasperated some politicians. While some residents saw the scooters as a convenient and clean solution to traffic jams, others piled them up in streets or threw them in waterways to protest startup hubris. Still uneasy with the new vehicles, San Francisco supervisors rushed to pass a resolution last week to regulate the rollout and enforce a ban on sidewalk riding that critics say is often disregarded. “Scooters may well be a part of our transportation and congestion solution, but we want to make sure they are operated safely and do not terrorize our pedestrians,” Supervisor Aaron Peskin said Monday. Politicians in the world’s rising tech capital are cracking down on the trend of companies trying out new ideas on the streets — like self-driving cars, scooters and food-delivery robots — with an “ask forgiveness, not permission” attitude. Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee introduced legislation last week to create an Office of Emerging Technology that would require companies to request approval for technologies that intersect with the public realm and issue one-year permits for those not currently covered by city law. Some worry that such regulation will stifle innovation, but officials say it’s necessary to control the rapid deployment of inventions like street-rented scooters. All four scooter operators are headquartered in San Francisco, but some didn’t get permission to operate on their home turf until Tuesday. On Tuesday, Lime representatives will meet riders at the San Francisco Caltrain station and conduct a safety workshop in a Bayview church. Jump, which already operates dockless electric bikes in the city, will stage a rally with the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition at City Hall for street safety. The tale of two-wheeled scooters in San Francisco has been one of the city playing catch-up with companies. In March 2018, Lime, Spin and Bird placed scooters on San Francisco sidewalks without permission. The city cracked down, temporarily banned scooters, and set up an application process for the initial pilot program. Only two of the dozen applicants, Skip and Scoot, got permits. Lime and Lyft protested the decision, saying they weren’t given a fair chance. This year, 11 companies applied for the new permits allowing up to 4,000 scooters. After the permits were announced, Supervisor Aaron Peskin led the push for a resolution adopted on Oct. 8 that would phase in deployment, develop an enforcement plan to curb illegal sidewalk riding and encourage the city to pursue a public alternative to private scooter rental companies. Peskin said regulation is now “in the hands of the (San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency), and they are serious about having robust enforcement.” In a blog post, the city transportation agency said the new program will track stricter compliance through a database where companies will report complaints and give updates on their resolutions to the city. The agency said operators “will also be required to take proactive measures to ensure that their customers are aware that sidewalk riding is both unsafe and illegal and implement deterrent measures, including graduated monetary penalties and suspensions for those who engage in unsafe riding behavior.” The city urged the public to curb “bad scooter behavior” by reporting violations to 311 or filing complaints directly with companies through the transportation agency’s sfmta.com website. City resident Marc Thornburgh, who takes a 4-mile walk along the Embarcadero every day, said scooters zip in and out between pedestrians on the sidewalk during rush hour. “Of course it will get even worse with the additional scooters, but I firmly believe this is an easily handled problem if the city puts enforcement personnel in the worst areas and hands out expensive tickets (not warnings),” Thornburgh said in an email. The scooter companies say they’re serious about following the rules on sidewalk riding. Lime is holding safety workshops. Jump is developing features to detect whether a rider is on the sidewalk or parked improperly on a new scooter model that could be introduced late this year. Spin said it updated its app to include rules of the road that riders must acknowledge they’ve read before starting, and added “no riding on sidewalk” stickers on all scooters. “It’s the rider’s responsibility to follow the rules, but a shared responsibility for Spin and the city to partner in educating the public on what is or isn’t allowed,” Spin spokeswoman Christine Yeo said in an email. The city is also requiring each company to pay $75 per scooter to support new bike racks, which can also be used to lock up scooters. San Francisco has committed to installing a minimum of 100 racks a month, doubling the current rate of new installations. The companies are also changing a key way that they operate, hiring employees instead of gig workers to recharge and maintain scooters. Scoot expects to double its San Francisco workforce. Spin said in a blog post earlier this month that it’s working with labor unions and city agencies to fill jobs (the company has hired 35 people so far) and provide internship opportunities to disadvantaged youth. Amid criticism that scooters weren’t serving everyone, each company has introduced a discount program for eligible low-income riders. Lime charges $5 a year for a limited number of rides to those who qualify; Jump offers that same rate, rising to $5 a month after the first year. Spin gives free unlimited 30-minute rides. Scoot offers a 50% discount and already has 700 riders on the plan. By making scooters more available, the companies and other advocates believe the vehicles will replace car congestion with a more environmentally friendly option. Spin President Euwyn Poon said in an email that the company looks forward “to honoring our commitments to hire locally, invest in the community, and ensure accessible, sustainable, and affordable transportation options are available to the whole city.” Lime CEO Brad Bao said in an email that the goal is to “help San Francisco lead the way in micromobility worldwide.” Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to reflect the companies that received permits to deploy scooters last year.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Up-to-2-500-scooters-hit-SF-streets-as-14521389.php
Idiot Takes E-Scooter Onto Bay Bridge,Sfist,Gothamist,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,10,31,"Idiot Takes E-Scooter Onto Bay Bridge. Some damn fool — apparently a tourist — took an e-scooter onto the Bay Bridge to head eastward during the evening commute on Wednesday. And no, he was not hurt or killed so he now must be publicly shamed. The scooter dude was spotted riding in the far right lane on the lower deck of the bridge by an Airbnb employee, who posted the sight on Twitter just before 6 p.m. on Wednesday. And, according to her, he used the carpool lane to get onto the bridge at 2nd and Bryant. As you can see, a pickup truck carrying bicycles spotted the guy and decided to ride slowly behind him with hazard lights on, for safety. The video has since been picked up by NBC Bay Area and SFGate — but KPIX has the scoop on the scooter dude himself, who actually got issued a citation by CHP officers who stopped him on Treasure Island. Reportedly, the guy was a tourist from the East Coast and was just trying to get to Oakland this way, because apparently he hadn't heard about BART? Officers tell KPIX that no drugs or alcohol were involved, just ""poor decision making."" They told the guy not to get back on the bridge, but he was able to get all the way to Oakland using the bike path on the eastern span. I would also like to point out that it has been a full year since South Park did their Halloween episode mocking the epidemic of e-scooters.",https://sfist.com/2019/10/31/idiot-takes-e-scooter-onto-bay-bridge/
San Francisco adding more bike and e-scooter parking across city,ABC 7 News,ABC,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,11,18,"San Francisco adding more bike and e-scooter parking across city. There's good news for bicyclists in San Francisco, the city plans to drastically increase the number of bike racks across town. On Monday, the SFMTA announced that the city will install 100 new bike racks every month for the foreseeable future. Each rack can hold roughly two bikes or four scooters, which officials hope will help clear sidewalks, stop the littering of shared scooters and help with pedestrian safety. The first bike corral was installed at 16th and Sanchez streets on Monday morning. ""This is the start of something very big in our city,"" says Brian Wiedenmeier, the Executive Director of San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. Bicyclists riding by were quick to praise the city's plan. ""There's not enough bike parking anywhere and especially with all the micro-mobility, like the scooters and stuff, starting to use the bike infrastructure,"" San Francisco resident Michael Kramer said. ""I mean, the more the merrier, more people out of cars the better, but still it's a crunch."" According to the SFMTA, more people are cycling on San Francisco streets than ever before, and it's on the rise. ""We expect to have 8,000 or more bike-share and scooter vehicles on the streets by the spring of 2020,"" SFMTA's Livable Streets Director Jamie Parks explained. ""And that means an increase in the demand for bike parking."" San Francisco's plans to add more bike racks is also to promote public safety. The new bike corrals are being placed in what would have been a parking spot, near a crosswalk. It's something called ""intersection daylighting."" ""We are making sure that for cars turning, they can more easily see somebody walking and crossing the street and vice versa,"" Wiedenmeier said. San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman adds, ""Doing things like these, daylighting intersections, saves lives, keeps people from being injured and that's critically important. And then to be able to use spaces like this for more bike parking is a double benefit."" When asked about drivers who are frustrated about losing parking spots for cars, Mandelman said ultimately, as the population of San Francisco grows, people need to be encouraged to stop driving and find other modes of transportation. Adding parking spots for bicycles and e-scooters is part of that plan.",https://abc7news.com/5705181/
"SF wants startups to behave, so why did it reject the ‘nice guy’ of e-scooters?",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,12,13,"SF wants startups to behave, so why did it reject the ‘nice guy’ of e-scooters? Remember back in the spring of 2018 when three companies dumped electric scooters around San Francisco without city permission, and riders illegally zipped along sidewalks, pedestrians be damned? City Attorney Dennis Herrera quickly issued a cease-and-desist letter to e-scooter operators Lime, Bird and Spin and said, “San Francisco has had enough of the mantra ‘move fast and break things.’” In a large warehouse in the Bayview, one scooter company, Skip, has been working to change the rogue image of the upstart industry. In fact, you could say it was moving slowly and trying to put things back together. After the scooter debacle, the city picked two companies to operate during a one-year trial beginning in October 2018. Skip — dubbed by Wired magazine “the nice guy of the scooter industry” — was tapped along with Scoot. During the pilot, complaints to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency of improperly parked scooters and bad scooter behavior dropped significantly. Skip hired workers rather than using independent contractors and gave them the same benefits as their CEO. At its warehouse, 40 technicians worked to repair broken scooters rather than junking them in an effort to reduce waste. It developed a locking system so scooters could be safely parked at bike racks and created scooter lights that are far brighter and easier to see than other models. It encouraged riders to wear helmets and gave free ones to its regular customers. On its website, it told its riders to yield to pedestrians, park properly, not allow another rider onboard, stay off sidewalks, and never drink and ride. So when 11 companies applied for permits to operate under the city’s new, permanent scooter program, Skip’s CEO, Sanjay Dastoor, figured his company was in for a smooth, predictable ride. But City Hall seems to want to make operating a business in the city about as bumpy as possible. On Sept. 25, those 40 technicians in the Skip warehouse learned through a media report that Skip could not continue operating in San Francisco after Oct. 15. “Pandemonium broke out in the warehouse — everybody was panicked,” recalled Sam Mollica, who was the lead technician for Skip’s repair operation. She had a Google alert for Skip set up on her phone, and the news popped up. “It was very unusual to be finding out our jobs were now in question through the press.” Instead, the Municipal Transportation Agency chose Scoot (acquired by Bird), Jump (owned by Uber), Spin (owned by Ford) and Lime. Notice some overlap with the companies that originally dumped scooters all over the city without permission? Thought so. Each company can now operate 600 to 1,000 scooters apiece. But why did the agency skip Skip? Apparently over a formatting issue. The agency’s lengthy application process judged each company on a scale of 1 (least robust — their words, not mine) to 4 (most robust). Each company had to have an average of 2.0 or higher in each section or it would be disqualified. Skip was disqualified because it scored a 1 in the safety category. That sounds shocking and worthy of disqualification. But Dastoor maintains — and a reading of the company’s application shows — a lot of information was included about the safety of Skip scooters. It’s just that the company did not format that section the way the transit agency wanted. The agency’s entire reasoning for the disqualification was, “Applicant did not provide a response for section A3 in the application.” Done. End of story. Buh-bye Skip. “If the information does not have the letter A and the number 3 and then the paragraph below it, then it’s not there and you’re disqualified,” Dastoor explained. “If you read through our application, you won’t see the letter A and the number 3 next to each other, and that was the grounds.” That can’t be right. Right? Erica Kato, a spokeswoman for the transit agency, did not respond specifically to that question, but referred to the scoring documents showing that, yes, the issue was the lack of paragraph A3. “Skip had a one-year permit with no guaranteed right for a second permit,” she wrote in an email, adding a hearing regarding Skip’s appeal of the decision has been scheduled for Jan. 23. “We are in the midst of an ongoing, active appeal process that will be heard by a neutral hearing officer,” she said. Not-so-funny story on that, too. Skip asked the Municipal Transportation Agency for the right to continue operating in the city during the appeal process, but was told in emails that the SFMTA didn’t have the authority to extend Skip’s permit. Even though it is the agency that issues the permits and runs the program. If it doesn’t have the authority, who does? In contrast, Washington, D.C., announced the winners of its 2020 permit program for e-scooters last week. Skip ranked the highest of 12 applicants, scoring particularly well on sustainability, labor, equitable access, innovation and, yes, safety. All the categories San Francisco says it cares so much about. Jump, Lyft and Spin also made the cut, while Lime and Bird did not. To be fair, it hasn’t been an entirely smooth road for Skip in San Francisco. The company made the news for a scooter catching fire in its Bayview warehouse in December and for the battery pack on a parked scooter in Washington, D.C., bursting into flames a few months later. Strangely, neither was cited by the agency in its low safety score, and the agency chose Lime and gave it a good safety rating despite that company having its own issues with battery fires. “We received high safety scores in D.C. after two battery incidents there, and all operators have had battery incidents whether publicized or not,” Dastoor said. The decision has, of course, been a big blow to Skip. Under the federal act governing plant closings and mass layoffs, it had to give its employees 60 days notice before terminating them. Companies using independent contractors wouldn’t have had to do that. Because the company had to keep its scooters operational through Oct. 15, many employees are out of jobs as of this weekend, just before Christmas. Dastoor said the company has tried to help its employees find jobs — even referring them to competitors that won the right to operate in San Francisco. That means if Skip wins its appeal, it’ll have to try to lure them back or hire a whole new staff. In another blow, Skip had signed a three-year lease costing $35,000 a month for the Bayview warehouse and has subleased it to Lime. “That investment we made is now benefiting one of our competitors,” Dastoor said. Mollica has spoken during public comment at agency meetings about how it was hard to find a job as a transgender woman and how working at Skip has allowed her to receive full health benefits and thrive in her profession. Another technician at the company said the job helped pull him out of homelessness, Dastoor said. This kind of community care seems like what Supervisor Norman Yee was pushing when he created the Office of Emerging Technology, due to launch next month. “A net public good should be a priority of all new technologies that companies want to test on city residents,” according to his office. Kim-Mai Cutler is a partner at the venture capital firm Initialized Capital, which has invested in Skip. She said the firm advised Skip to “do the right thing” and not disrespect the city like other companies had done, but it didn’t pay off. “If there is a genuine interest in having a more collaborative, respectful relationship with companies, the city should think about what types of behavior it wants to reward and what types of behavior it doesn’t,” she said. “There just aren’t very coherent messages coming out of the city about how to work with it.” Shortly before turning over the keys to Lime, Mollica and Dastoor gave me a tour of the warehouse where there wasn’t much to see because all the scooters, parts and technicians were gone. As they locked up for the last time, they were both downcast. “We made a lot of investments in this city with the long term in mind, but this process has made it very clear why some companies choose not to do that,” Dastoor said. The lesson he learned about doing business in San Francisco? “Don’t invest in the long term,” he said. “Optimize for short-term gain.” Sadly we have enough of that attitude in San Francisco already.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/heatherknight/article/SF-wants-startups-to-behave-so-why-did-it-reject-14903323.php
Hundreds more scooters to zip down SF streets,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,12,14,"Hundreds more scooters to zip down SF streets. San Francisco will allow 750 more electric rental scooters onto the streets Sunday as the second phase of a pilot program rolls out. That brings the total number of scooters allowed in the city to 3,250. It’s a mark of cautious approval for a clean but controversial technology, which still leaves people worried about illegal sidewalk riding and injuries. Scoot, owned by Santa Monica company Bird, has a permit for 1,000 scooters. Lime, Jump (owned by Uber) and Spin each can offer 750; before Sunday, those three companies were each limited to 500. Companies said more scooters could be expected in the Mission, Castro, Western Addition, Bayview Hunters Point, Excelsior, Ingleside, and Outer Mission neighborhoods, and in the San Francisco State University area. Two months into San Francisco’s pilot program, Supervisor Aaron Peskin cautiously voiced support. “I would say so far, not bad, compared to ‘scooter-geddon’ of last year,” Peskin said, comparing the unregulated scooters that swarmed city streets in spring 2018 to an apocalypse. “Although there is still some sidewalk riding and still some injuries, all in all the rollout has been going well.” A number of concerns remain, he said, including whether the batteries end up in landfills, equitable distribution of scooters, brain injuries from accidents and sidewalk riding. Norman Yee, president of the Board of Supervisors, said he wants to see companies take more ownership and responsibility regarding safe use of their products on the streets. Riding on sidewalks is still a problem, and enforcement “is being put on the shoulders of our Police Department, which would cost the city more money,” he said. Yee recently backed legislation that created the Office of Emerging Technology to regulate new tech inventions, like scooters when they first hit the streets. Rohit Agarwal, cruising along a downtown alley on a Scoot on Friday, said he uses scooters almost daily because they’re the most efficient way to get from his Potrero Hill home to work at Second and Mission streets. “They’re hyper-efficient and fun, but the safety is a bit questionable,” the 35-year-old investor said. He’s fallen twice while riding. Once, he was hit by a door opened by a ride-hailing passenger while he was in the bike lane. The second time, he slipped on a pebble. Both times he was just bruised. Agarwal said scooters are faster than rental bikes but more expensive — an average of $5 to $8 for the scooter, cheaper in the morning than the evening, versus $2 for a bike. When it’s raining, he takes a shared car ride that costs the same as a scooter. Agarwal, who described himself as an “avid regular user,” said the city is “probably not” ready for more scooters. “I like it a lot and I find it very convenient and super helpful, but I think it’s inevitable, given how congested the city is, that there will be more accidents,” he said. Karin Flood, executive director of the Union Square Business Improvement District, said things have gotten better since scooters flooded the city last year, but there’s no ideal place to ride them. Scooters pose dangers and are illegal on San Francisco sidewalks. But “the street does not seem like a safe option right now,” she said. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency stresses that the safety of riders and pedestrians is its top priority. It requires companies to take measures to educate riders about the sidewalk ban and introduce deterrents, fine or suspend riders who break the rules. California does not require adult riders to wear helmets. Lime said the agency levies a $100 fine for infractions, which it passes along to the responsible rider with information about how to not repeat the offense. Uber said it’s planning to do the same. Spin outlines its fee structure: $10 for a first sidewalk riding offense, $25 and a 24-hour suspension the second time, account and payment method banned the third. Improper parking gets warnings that escalates to $5 on the second offense, $10 the third time, and account suspension after that. Most companies post their riding rules in small type on their scooters, either on the neck or near the handlebars. They also have in-app messaging and community meetings to educate the public. Scoot said less than 1% of its rides result in a parking complaint and 78% of its riders signed an in-app pledge to follow road rules before using the app. The company said its employees identify poorly parked and ridden scooters and report them to management. Uber is developing an in-app feature to detect sidewalk riding that it hopes to test in San Francisco soon and is talking with advocacy groups about creating a scooter-like vehicle for people with disabilities. Lime, after organizing meetings with advocates, is on track to launch its adaptive vehicles in January. Spin said that in high-traffic areas, employees are available near lined-up scooters to explain city rules. It also plans to install more parking hubs to reduce clutter. George Franklin, 66, a longtime city resident who now lives in Berkeley but works in North Beach, suggested the city spend money on signs warning scooter users that riding on the sidewalk is a violation. Another longtime resident, Fran Taylor, 70, has submitted a dozen complaints about scooters on sidewalks but said that recently “she’s sort of given up” because nothing seems to change. She said sidewalk riding affects seniors, parents of young children and people with disabilities. “My main concern was having them come at you on the sidewalk and a lot of the sidewalks are narrow and crowded,” Taylor said. “Sidewalk space historically hasn’t been respected in San Francisco. ... This just seemed like the latest assault.” Taylor said scooters could be a great alternative to cars if they’re used on the street or in bike lanes. A May report from Boston Consulting Group found that scooter companies are hard-pressed to make money: The devices have an average life span of three months, but companies need four months to break even per device. Longer-lasting batteries may help. The report also forecast consolidation in the industry, and that is indeed happening. In June, Bird bought Scoot, a San Francisco company, and its coveted city permit. In early December, Bird laid off about 18 original Scoot employees, according to Peskin. A Scoot representative said the company “is proud to have always offered, and continue to offer, positions that pay well, provide great benefits and stock options, as well as training programs and room for growth.” A week after Scoot’s layoffs, about 40 workers at Spin voted to unionize. A representative said the company will begin a collective bargaining agreement and plans to hire more employees. Ben Barnett, a Municipal Transportation Agency spokesman, said his agency strongly supports the right of workers to unionize and is pleased Spin signed an agreement with Teamsters Local 665 to remain neutral on worker unionization. The other three companies have not signed. “We don’t know whether these jobs are going to exist five or 10 years down the road, whether scooters are a passing fad,” said Doug Bloch, political director for Teamsters.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Hundreds-more-scooters-to-zip-down-SF-streets-14905922.php
750 Additional E-Scooters Allowed In San Francisco As The City's Expansion Program Matures,Sfist,Gothamist,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2019,12,15,"750 Additional E-Scooters Allowed In San Francisco As The City's Expansion Program Matures. Like them or not, several hundred new electric scooters are permitted to hit the pavement today as part of a city-wide initiative to increase their availability, sans (hopefully) another ""scooter-geddon."" The Chronicle reported yesterday that, as part of an experimental initiative, three e-scooter suppliers – recently-unionized Spin, Lime, and Uber-owned Jump – could, up to today, only flood the streets with 500 units each. (A notable omission from this list is Bird, the troubled like-industry venture which recently laid off a number of Bay Area employees earlier this month.) However, starting today, each of those three aforementioned companies has the ability to secure another 250 unis to their fleets, amassing for a grand total of 750 more e-scooters to aggravate pedestrians, bikers, (politicians!) and drivers alike in SF. “I would say so far, not bad, compared to ‘scooter-geddon’ of last year,” said Supervisor Aaron Peskin about the fairly new program earlier this year to the Chronicle, nodding in agreeance that 2018 was a troubled year for the zero-emissions mini-motorcycles. “Although there is still some sidewalk riding and still some injuries, all in all, the rollout has been going well.” Today's deluge of new scooters are slated to populate the neighborhoods mentioned below: Mission District The Castro Western Addition Bayview Hunters Point Excelsior Ingleside Outer Mission Areas outside San Francisco State University A litany of cautionary red flags remain unanswered or still in murky waters: What will be of these batteries when they're deemed dead? How will these e-scooter companies be held accountable for distributing their units, equally? What can the city do to ensure sidewalk safety? Regardless of those answers, San Franciscans and transients, too, can now expect there to be some 3,250 e-scooters in the city at any point. And by February of 2020, that number blooms to 4,o00; San Francisco will allow another 250 units from each of the three providers come February 15th of next year. Be safe out there, gang ... and, perhaps, take out the AirPods for a hot second, so you can hear the electrical whine of a speeding scooter to your six o'clock.",https://sfist.com/2019/12/15/750-additional-e-scooters-allowed-in-san-francisco-as-the-citys-expansion-program-matures/

A Central Valley man was arrested after police traced electric scooters — stolen from the Bay Area — to a recreational vehicle parked in his driveway in French Camp, according to the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office. Timothy McMahon, 38, was booked in the San Joaquin County Jail on suspicion of multiple counts of felony possession of stolen property, according to a Facebook post by the Sheriff’s Office. An employee of Gruv, a scooter company, contacted the Sheriff’s Office last week to report several scooters stolen from Oakland, and said the company’s GPS locators showed the scooters in French Camp. Deputies responded to an address on Wayne Court, where they found McMahon, who is on searchable probation. Police found 20 electric scooters owned by a number of companies — including Gruv, Lyft, Lime and Bird — in an RV parked in McMahon’s driveway. All the scooters were damaged, dismantled or altered, some with the GPS locators removed and destroyed, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

City Aims to Shut Down 'Rogue' Scooter Company Go X for Operating With Allegedly Forged Permit,Sfist,Gothamist,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,1,8,"City Aims to Shut Down 'Rogue' Scooter Company Go X for Operating With Allegedly Forged Permit. Calling the business's actions ""next-level craziness,"" the SFMTA and the City Attorney's Office are seeking to shut down the e-scooter company Go X, which has been operating in San Francisco without a city permit now for a year. In a letter this week to Go X, the City Attorney's Office says that the company owes the city over $200,000 in citations and ""fraudulently"" created its own permit — using the seal of the city's Chamber of Commerce — in order to purport to area business partners that it had permission to operate legally in the city. As the Examiner reports, Go X founder Alexander Debelov apparently was not aware that the Chamber of Commerce was not a city department, and that their blessing had nothing to do with the law. ""Go X is nothing more than a rogue company,"" says City Attorney's Office spokesperson John Cote in a statement to the media. ""Go X seems to think it’s above the law. It couldn’t be more mistaken."" As KPIX reports, Go X has been given until January 18 to cease all operations here and get its scooters off the street. Go X issued a statement Tuesday saying, ""Go-X worked with Chamber of Commerce to create private scooter rental permits and has received their explicit permission to use their seal on all of the permits."" San Francisco currently allows four e-scooter companies to operate in the city under the SFMTA’s Powered Scooter Share Permit program. This followed a glut of free-for-all scooter madness in 2018 as this new-but-retro form of transportation captured the imaginations of tourists and young locals alike, and companies were willy-nilly dumping their scooters on sidewalks all over. The companies that won out in the permitting process are Lime, Spin, Scoot, and Jump. Go X has been operating under a slightly different scooter-rental model in which the scooters are tied to specific businesses, like Fisherman's Wharf hotels and Embarcadero restaurants. Go X gives these businesses a cut of the scooter revenue, and scooter users are supposed to return the scooters to one of these 55 partner businesses when they're done. As the Examiner reported last fall, the company has been getting citations and seeing their scooters impounded since their ""soft launch"" last January. Debelov told the paper at the time that his company didn't need a city permit because of their different operating model, but then that seems to be contradicted by the copy of the supposed permit that the City Attorney's Office shared. The City Attorney alleges that Go X told merchants that it had met with the city and received City Attorney's Office approval, and ""That is a lie."" Debelov denies these claims, however when told that the Chamber of Commerce was a private organization with no ties to the city, he was apparently surprised. Amusingly, the Go X promo video released last July features a dude picking up a Go X scooter on the sidewalk right outside his house (not at a business), and then riding it to a picnic brunch while also apparently stealing some flowers from a market along the way. The Examiner also spoke to SFMTA board chair Gwyneth Borden who said of the faked permit, ""That is just next-level craziness, we’re not even talking about lots of other things with them not paying fines."" The loophole that Go X was apparently exploiting is closing on January 18 when an amendment to the wording of the e-scooter permit ordinance goes into effect. Mayor Breed signed it in December, and it says that any e-scooter operating on city streets, whether parked on public sidewalks or not, needs a city permit.",https://sfist.com/2020/01/08/city-aims-to-shut-down-rogue-scooter-company/
S.F. city attorney orders rebel e-scooter company to shut down immediately,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,1,8,"S.F. city attorney orders rebel e-scooter company to shut down immediately. The San Francisco city attorney sent a cease-and-desist order Tuesday to a rogue e-scooter company that has parked vehicles along Fisherman’s Wharf and the Embarcadero and that it says is using fake permits with the city seal. Startup Go X engaged in “dangerous and illegal conduct that interfered with the city’s impoundment of improperly parked scooters,” City Attorney Dennis Herrera wrote in a letter to the company’s lawyer, Joshua Ridless. He ordered the company to shut down by Jan. 18 or face immediate abatement under the general public nuisance law and the state’s unfair competition law. The company owes $233,800 in unpaid fines, after racking up 540 citations in 10 months for operating without a permit and carelessly stashing e-scooters in the public right-of-way, according to the city. By doing business this way, it gained an unlawful and unfair advantage over competitors that abided by the city’s Powered Scooter Share Permit Program, Herrera wrote. Go X CEO Alex Debelov said he was perplexed. In an interview Tuesday he characterized himself as a well-intentioned entrepreneur who didn’t fall within the city’s regulations, because his company parks scooters at businesses — mostly hotels — rather than on curbs. Since starting in May he’s put 1,000 e-scooters on streets, spreading them along Fisherman’s Wharf, into the Financial District and to Union Square. Debelov has partnered with more than 70 businesses, sharing revenue from scooter rides in exchange for space to park. He hopes to get authorization from the city to keep operating past Jan. 18. Debelov said he’s tried to cooperate with the city, while using his own legal theory to expand a business. “Overall our customers are very happy,” he said. The city isn’t buying it. Herrera gave a detailed account of misbehavior, from a startup that leased space from local merchants, wrote bad checks to the city purporting to pay fines and obstructed Public Works employees who impounded its vehicles. Go X also swiped the Chamber of Commerce logo for its fake permit, the chamber says, catching the attention of CEO Rodney Fong, who wrote to Herrera on Monday. “The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce does not distribute private scooter rental permits, or any city permits,” Fong wrote, adding that his organization did not condone this use of the logo or “the statement it represents.” In one instance, a Go X representative boarded a Department of Public Works truck and seized several scooters that the city had lawfully taken for blocking public streets and sidewalks. The scooters were en route to a storage facility. Herrera’s spokesman, John Coté, spurned the company. “Not only is it operating illegally, it lied to businesses about having permits approved by the City and the Chamber of Commerce,” Coté wrote in a statement. “Go X seems to think it’s above the law. It couldn’t be more mistaken.” Yet Debelov protested, saying he’d reached out to city agencies. He said he crafted the document with the Chamber of Commerce logo to distinguish himself from one of the permitted e-scooter companies that rents from public streets. Go X riders are instructed to leave their two- and three-wheeled devices at one of the company’s partner businesses. Those who leave scooters on the street are charged a recovery fee of $15 to $25. Ridless declined to comment Tuesday afternoon, saying he had not yet read the letter or spoken with his client. E-scooters created controversy when they plopped down in San Francisco in spring 2018 — a tech gadget invasion that some compared to aliens from outer space, though others welcomed the new form of micromobility. The city’s new transportation chief, Jeffrey Tumlin, has touted scooters as a potential alternative to cars. But he chastised Go X for continuously disobeying the law. “This behavior is not in the best interests of San Franciscans,” Tumlin said. “We take compliance and safety seriously, and we won’t tolerate the egregious behavior we’ve seen from Go X.” After months of debate in City Hall, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency created a permit program that became permanent in July. In December the city permitted 750 more e-scooters, bringing the total number to 3,250.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/City-Attorney-tells-rebel-e-scooter-company-to-14957553.php

Largest e-scooter company in San Jose knows when you’re illegally riding on sidewalks ,Mercury News,Bay Area News Group,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,1,28,"Largest e-scooter company in San Jose knows when you’re illegally riding on sidewalks. It plans to use this technology to stop people from riding on the sidewalk. As officials across the country try to stop electric scooter riders from swerving in between pedestrians on busy sidewalks, one company has come up with what it thinks could be the answer. Lime — the scooter company with the largest fleet in San Jose — announced Tuesday that it had developed first-of-its-kind technology to detect when riders are traveling on a sidewalk rather than on a street or in a bike lane. Lime’s technology relies on the basis that sidewalks, unlike roads, consist of evenly-spaced grooves and therefore vibrate differently than when a rider is traveling on a roadway. The company’s software programmed in each scooter uses acceleration and speed data to then detect when a scooter is on a sidewalk with up to 95 percent confidence. The e-scooter company’s announcement was the result of a collaboration with San Jose, which is allowing scooter companies to test out sidewalk detection technology in its downtown core. “We want to not only partner with the city on preventing this but also helping provide them with data to build better infrastructure because that’s the number one reason that people ride on the sidewalk is that they don’t feel safe on the street,” said EV Ellington, Lime’s general manager of Northern California and Utah. Unlike cities that have outright bans or restrictions on the number of scooters or companies authorized to operate in a city, San Jose leaders have taken a different approach. In December 2018, the San Jose City Council passed legislation that required electric scooter companies that want to deploy their scooters in San Jose to get a permit from the city, pay an annual permit application fee of $2,500 and submit another $124 per device each year. The companies are also required to obtain insurance and protect the city from legal claims. Since San Jose launched its scooter permit program in February 2019, the city has issued permits to six companies for a total of 5,750 e-scooters — 2,300 of which belong to Lime. “I believe that we can work with technology companies to find ways to improve quality of life, improve safety, improve equity,” San Jose Mayor Liccardo said Tuesday. “We know that this is something that we will need in our transportation toolbox, so let’s find a way to integrate it into our city and make sure it’s safe, rather than simply declaring war on it.” As part of the new requirement, the council tasked city staff to work with the permitted companies to figure out a way to keep scooters off of sidewalks — a trend that is very common but actually illegal under California state law — by July of 2019. Yet seven months after that deadline, Lime is the first company to make any moves toward trying to change the habits of riders. John Ristow, director of the city’s department of transportation, said that the companies were always on board but that the 7-month delay was due to “bureaucratic and administrative” hangups. “Unfortunately we had some difficulties, just as new permitting goes and it took us a little longer to get all of the companies under permits and contracts,” Ristow said Tuesday. Under the technology initiative launched by Lime, riders who spend a significant chunk of their trip on what the company detects are sidewalks will receive a notification that informs them of the illegal activity. The city and e-scooter company do not currently have plans to penalize riders and instead plan to start by focusing on education. “If we get to a place where the technology is good enough for us to feel as though it’s reliable to issue a ticket and we think it’s a good idea, then we’ll certainly do it,” Liccardo said Tuesday. “But it’s not the case today, frankly, that every street is the safer place to riding a scooter or a bike either.” As part of the permit requirements, Lime will share the data it collects on sidewalk ridership with the city on a monthly basis. City staff plan to meet with the other five permitted scooter companies — Lyft, Bird, Spin, Razor and Gruv — within the coming weeks to review their technology detection plans.",https://www.mercurynews.com/scooter-company-serving-san-jose-detects-when-youre-illegally-riding-on-sidewalks
This SF scooter company knows if you’re riding illegally on a sidewalk. Here’s how,San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,1,28,"This SF scooter company knows if you’re riding illegally on a sidewalk. Here’s how. We’ve all seen it: an electric scooter zipping by on the sidewalk, weaving through pedestrians. In California, this is illegal. The sidewalk riding ban has been a point of tension among scooter companies, local governments and riders as everyone points fingers about who’s to blame for breaking the law and who should enforce it. Now, one San Francisco company says it has a solution. Lime, which has scooters across the Bay Area, is introducing technology, which may be the first of its kind, to detect sidewalk riding. It’s based on the assumption that sidewalks — with evenly spaced grooves between concrete slabs — have a predictably different surface than roads. The company says its in-app software, which The Chronicle viewed a demonstration of prior to the company’s planned announcement on Tuesday, can judge based on vibration data at timed intervals whether the scooter is on a sidewalk with up to 95% confidence. Scooter riders who spend more than half of their trip on what appears to be the sidewalk will get a notification and a map in the app saying that their activity was illegal. The company will follow up with an email. There are no penalties, at least not yet: the company says the pilot program is about educating riders. The technology will come to Lime’s 1,200 scooters currently in downtown San Jose (it’s permitted for 2,300) in coming weeks. That’s an easier testing ground than the congested streets and bumpy sidewalks of San Francisco or Oakland, where Lime hopes to expand the sidewalk-detection pilot, but doesn’t have a timeline. “I think every mayor in this country knows that you could deploy a police officer to every corner and you still wouldn’t be able to stop folks from riding scooters on sidewalks,” San Jose mayor Sam Liccardo said. “We clearly need to find a technological solution.” EV Ellington, Lime’s Northern California general manager, said in a statement, “We may have finally cracked the code on this issue and developed a technology that is effective and scalable.” For more than a year, Lime tried out other technological solutions, but found that GPS wasn’t accurate enough to identify sidewalks, and if technology caused a scooter to suddenly slow down when crossing a curb, it could be unsafe. Adding cameras and storing video data was costly. Bay Area cities have been scrambling to regulate scooters since they popped up in spring 2018. Part of San Jose’s permit pushed companies to develop sidewalk riding detection technology and prove its effectiveness by Friday. If they fail to do so, San Jose could penalize them by limiting scooters or issuing fines. “Ultimately, the primary responsibility of any city is for the safety of its residents,” Liccardo said. “We recognize there are disruptive technologies that are challenging to regulate. Then we need to put it on the companies to utilize their technology to help us make the industry safer.” San Jose is meeting with the five other scooter companies (Bird, Lyft, Spin, Gruv and Razor) this month to review plans. Some locals questioned whether rider education without penalties will make a difference. “It’ll be ignored like it currently is,” said Scott Knies, executive director of the San Jose Downtown Association. “People don’t feel safe in the bike lane or the road, and they’re going to ride on the sidewalk and going to whiz past pedestrians. ... As people get fed up with it, it’s going to end up falling mostly on the companies and the public sector.” Technically, it’s the city’s responsibility to enforce laws, “but there’s much higher priorities,” Knies said. “That’s not what the community is clamoring for in terms of police time.” He believed that ultimately, if companies receive enough backlash, they will have to come up with innovative enforcement — like Lime is doing. Assaf Biderman, associate director of MIT research organization Senseable City Lab and CEO of scooter designer Superpedestrian, said it’s “fairly simple” to count lines on the sidewalk, but it isn’t foolproof because not all surfaces are the same. “We can make improvements, but we don’t yet have a 100% detection method that’s deployable at the moment to detect sidewalks,” Biderman said, adding it’s difficult to detect immediately. Superpedestrian’s scooters can enforce rules, by for example automatically slowing down incrementally in an area where technology has indicated that it’s necessary, in less than a second. Lime’s technology detects sidewalk patterns after a few seconds. Lime said it would be extremely rare if someone was falsely notified that they were riding on the sidewalk. If that happened, the rider wouldn’t suffer any consequences and could just let the company know. The company intends to collect data on riders using sidewalks and give that to San Jose to help the city decide which streets could use more protected bike lanes, a move that the Silicon Valley Bike Coalition applauded for safety. A recent UCSF study found scooter-related injuries resulting in hospitalization more than tripled over five years nationwide. Another San Francisco scooter company, Jump, owned by Uber, previously said it was developing sidewalk riding detection technology, but declined to comment for this story. Bird, which owns Scoot, a company that operates in San Francisco, had no updates to share on similar technology. A spokeswoman for Spin, which is owned by Ford and has scooters in San Francisco, said in an email that the company has technology that virtually blocks off certain areas, but “when it comes to the issue of sidewalk riding, we can’t expect riders to change their behavior if they don’t feel safe riding in our streets.” For now, the company provides in-app and in-person education to ensure riders understand the rules. Knies said scooters were initially disruptive, blocking sidewalks and endangering pedestrians. He’s now accepted that they’re a part of the city, although problems persist. “It’s going to take a village to get this right,” he said.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/This-SF-scooter-company-knows-if-you-re-riding-15008810.php

At least until October. On Saturday, San Francisco’s transportation agency began allowing four companies — Lime, Spin (owned by Ford), Jump (owned by Uber), and Scoot (owned by Bird) — to release 750 more scooters collectively to reach the city’s 4,000 limit. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency is strictly controlling the once-rogue two-wheelers that took over the streets nearly two years ago. The goal is to provide a safe, equitable, and accessible form of public transportation, and the city granted permits only to companies that pledged to abide by the rules. “We are excited to expand the range of sustainable transportation options in the city of San Francisco, including scooters, which provide a convenient, on-demand travel option for shorter trips and an alternative to driving,” agency spokeswoman Erica Kato said in an email. San Francisco scooter riders took around 8,000 trips a day in January, according to the agency. Scooters are capped at 400 in downtown areas, so the latest expansion means neighborhoods farther from the city’s core will get more. Since the start of the program in October, scooters have nearly doubled in the Mission District and quadrupled in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the city, as well as the Western Addition neighborhood. Some data suggest that scooter companies are fulfilling their vision of replacing car trips with cleaner and greener transit. Surveys by Lime and Scoot say that 1 in 3 riders rented a scooter instead of hailing a car. The Chronicle also obtained compliance reports and complaint data submitted by scooter companies to the cities. Here is what it reveals: Safety: Despite rampant concerns about scooters being ridden on sidewalks and blocking sidewalks, including disabled access ramps, transit agency data show bad behavior accounts for a minuscule fraction of total rides. In monthly reports from October to December by the four companies to the Municipal Transportation Agency, 39 collisions were reported out of 515,739 rides. Most involved just a scooter, although some involved cars too. Twenty riders sustained injuries; three were reported as serious, with one ambulance called. Companies also tracked the number of safety trainings for riders and members of the public, although that didn’t translate to avoiding crashes: Scoot had the highest number of trainings (15) and the most collisions (20). Lime, which held only two trainings, had a perfect safety record until one of its scooters was involved in a crash into a cement mixer on the Embarcadero that hospitalized a 69-year-old woman with serious injuries. The scooter companies’ reports didn’t give many details on accidents, but an agency complaint database compiled from company reports and 311 calls did. Although the data is imperfect (not every incident was confirmed in San Francisco and some companies defined categories differently), it paints a more colorful picture of what still isn’t working as the city adjusts to a new transportation method. Among the issues: Dogs peeing on scooters left unlocked. Device alarms going on incessantly. A scooter abandoned in Sausalito. A rider hit by a passenger opening a door of a double-parked ride-hail car. A video showing a scooter rider going the wrong way down a South of Market street during rush hour. Business managers and parks employees demanding the removal of improperly parked scooters. Parking — whether obstructing public access, private property or overwhelming bike racks — was the biggest complaint, although riding on sidewalks might be harder to report as a scooter whizzes by. Nonetheless, companies’ reports to the Municipal Transportation Agency suggested they had near-perfect parking records — more than 99% — compared with total rides. Enforcing sidewalk riding laws is still an intractable issue. Companies reported 127 violations in the first three months of the program. Lime had the most (59). The San Francisco Police Department issues moving violations for sidewalk riding, but the city’s traffic court couldn’t provide data on the number of offenses because vehicle violations aren’t scooter-specific. The Municipal Transportation Agency is responsible for making sure companies follow all the other rules and fining companies who break them. Kato said the agency’s enforcement team is out on the streets every day monitoring for compliance and issuing citations to riders of both permitted and nonpermitted scooters for improper parking. The agency issued a cease-and-desist order to unlicensed scooter operator Go X, which announced last week that it is back in business. The city said it’s still illegal. The city also puts the onus on companies to educate riders and hold them accountable with fines and suspension of privileges. Companies are tackling law-breaking with 24-hour hotlines, in-app messaging, incentives for wearing helmets and safety classes. “Some of the problem comes from people not knowing how to operate the scooters, so we’re trying to combat that through community events and education,” Spin spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski said. “Some riders don’t take the time to do it themselves, so it’s important to make sure we’re doing our part to educate them.” Spin has issued more than 1,200 corrections and warnings based on photos of parked scooters taken by users at the end of their ride. Spin workers patrol neighborhoods and help riders unlock scooters at key commuter locations. To cut down on bad parking, the company plans to introduce four preferred parking spots in SoMa and the Embarcadero; riders can get 25 cents off their next ride if they park there. Making space for scooters is part of a city conversation about traffic that led to the recent car-free redesign of part of Market Street. Companies stressed that infrastructure protecting riders is vital: A Lime survey found that half of riders ranked a protected bike lane as their No. 1 choice for riding. In one complaint about illegal sidewalk riding in the database, the rider apologized for riding on the sidewalk when confronted and told of feeling unsafe in Van Ness Avenue traffic. Lime, which introduced a sidewalk riding detection technology in San Jose and hopes to bring it to San Francisco, said it hopes to gather data about where riders are using the sidewalk to help cities know where more bike lanes are needed. Kato said the transit agency will “welcome and will consider all tools to enforce proper/responsible scooter operation.” Accessibility: The city required companies to design a modified scooter by Jan. 15 to ensure that disabled San Franciscans aren’t shut out from the new transportation form. Although the four companies met the deadline, only Spin and Lime have received requests from riders for their modified scooters a month into the pilot program. Spin recently got one request from a woman who uses the adapted model to deliver groceries. Lime, which unlike other companies offers to deliver its adapted scooter to a rider’s location on request, had 72 calls from San Francisco, Oakland, Hayward, and Alameda (two requests weren’t fulfilled because scooters can’t be delivered outside the service areas in San Francisco and Oakland). Equity: The city requires companies to offer discounted rides to low-income riders, as defined by the Municipal Transportation Agency. The idea is to ensure that scooters are a true form of public transportation, used by everyone. For the first three months of the program, companies signed up 3,566 low-income riders. Scoot had the highest number (2,588), followed by Lime (635), Jump (213) and Spin (130).",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Abandoned-peed-on-by-dogs-As-SF-scooters-ramp-15058401.php

"Get ready, Palo Alto. Scooters are about to hit the streets.",Palo Alto Online,Association of Alternative Newsmedia,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,3,3,"Get ready, Palo Alto. Scooters are about to hit the streets. With bike shares on the wane and electric scooters on the rise, City Council approves latest pilot program for 'micromobility'. After two years of delays, Palo Alto is preparing to join the electric scooter era this spring, when the city plans to start inviting companies to roll out their motorized fleets on local streets. The City Council approved on Monday night an extension of the pilot program that was initially approved in March 2018 but that never took off because of staffing shortages at City Hall. Now, with the new Office of Transportation in place and electric scooters emerging as an increasingly familiar presence on the streets of Santa Monica, Oakland and elsewhere in the state, Palo Alto is preparing to join the movement. The city's Chief Transportation Official Philip Kamhi said staff is in the process of finalizing the permit guidelines for bike- and scooter-share companies, with the expectation that they can start applying for permits later this month. Kamhi said staff envisions a three-week application period, followed by four weeks of reviewing applications and then the issuance of permits. Companies would then be expected to perform community outreach for four weeks after the permit issuance, after which time they would be able to deploy their bikes and scooters throughout the city. While the council has been talking about bike- and scooter-share programs for years, the environment has evolved, Kamhi said. Bike share programs are going away, he said, as vendors are switching primarily to scooter sharing. And while the council has in the past considered a partnership with a single company for deploying dozens — or even hundreds — of bikes for a new program, the latest approach relies entirely on private vendors to provide the services.

""Although programs had previously been approved by the council, staff made adjustments to the program based on the rapidly changing micromobility landscape and lessons learned,"" Kamhi told the council. Under the new program, instead of dictating to companies where to place their bikes, it will invite them to propose ""incentivized parking areas"" for their bikes and scooters. This can include popular shopping areas such as Stanford Shopping Center and Town & Country Village, as well as Caltrain stations, libraries, parks and other locations proposed by applicants. Vendors will also have to institute ""geofencing"" around these areas (which sets boundaries for where riders can take a scooter) and implement technologies to direct users to these locations, according to the proposed guidelines. In another departure from the past, the city will no longer set a cap on how many bikes and scooters can be in the system. The city manager will, however, have the discretion to declare certain blocks as off-limits for bicycle and scooter parking. And by requiring community outreach, the city is hoping to avoid the pitfall of past efforts: the extremely low usage of its former bike-share offerings. The council voted 6-0, with Councilwoman Lydia Kou absent, to approve the latest extension of the pilot program, with the idea of letting it roll out for six to nine months and then re-evaluating the results. While the enrollment process won't begin for several weeks, Kamhi said he has heard from multiple companies already and is confident that the city will see applicants. ""We will definitely have people applying,"" Kamhi said. ""They were very interested in applying previously. We just hadn't finalized the guidelines and released the process for doing so."" One company that has expressed interest, Lime, already runs electric scooters in about 120 cities, including Oakland and San Jose. Sam Kang, Lime's director of government affairs in California and Arizona, told the council that the company has seen 2.5 million rides over its two years in Oakland, with about 80% of them coming to and from transit stations. He also noted that in San Jose, where the company has seen 2 million rides, about one-third of scooter trips displaced car commutes or ride-share companies. ""Outside of San Jose, the Valley has been conspicuously absent from this wave taking hold, in terms of multimodal transportation and micromobility,"" Kang told the council. ""We want to be the last-mile solution in Palo Alto,"" he added, alluding to the challenge some commuters have in getting from the train station to their final destination. The council broadly supported the scooter experiment, which Councilman Greg Tanaka said takes the city in the ""right direction"" when it comes to solving its transportation challenges. Mayor Adrian Fine agreed, even as he acknowledged that the new program is not a panacea. ""It's one small strategy and one small part of the pie,"" Fine said.",https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2020/03/03/get-ready-palo-alto-scooters-are-about-to-hit-the-streets
Coronavirus pushes SF e-scooter companies to ‘pause’ operations,SFExaminer,San Fracisco Media Company,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,3,19,"Coronavirus pushes SF e-scooter companies to ‘pause’ operations. Spin is only operator to maintain service with SFMTA’s backing. The transit-pocalypse sapping riders from Muni, BART, and ferries has claimed another San Francisco wheeled-service: e-scooters. Three out of four San Francisco-based e-scooter rental companies are pausing operations due to coronavirus pandemic concerns, those companies announced. Lime, Scoot, and Jump, which is owned by Uber, have all said they will pause local operations. The lone e-scooter company still operating in San Francisco, for now, is Spin, which is owned and operated by Ford Motor Company. But Spin may have city backing in doing so: In an email, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency told “shared mobility operators,” which include e-bike operators, that e-scooter rentals and bikeshare are considered “essential” services with city permission to continue operation, even as many local businesses have been ordered to close. “We thank all operators in advance for continuing service,” SFMTA wrote to mobility operators in an email, “it remains our vision that healthy mobility options for San Franciscans remain available for all essential trips.” Still, SFMTA said it would waive requirements that e-scooter companies maintain certain levels of service for the duration of the coronavirus crisis, and that “it is OK if an operator decides to suspend service during the crisis.” San Franciscans were ordered to shelter-in-place starting Tuesday. Mayor London Breed also ordered non-essential businesses, like bars, to close, sending much of The City’s service-based industries into a tailspin. Similarly, ridership on BART dropped to 88 percent Wednesday, and Muni is losing $1 million weekly due to a ridership drop, according to the SFMTA. Many transit riders say publicly they have avoided public transit as they try to remain “socially distant,” an effort to keep clear of others to avoid contamination. In a statement, Spin Senior Policy Council Nima Rahimi said e-scooters can offer an alternative to public transportation in light of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines to maintain “social distancing.” “Our service can provide transportation access for essential trips — like rides to grocery stores and pharmacies to medical care and COVID-19 testing facilities — that by its nature allows for social distancing,” Rahimi wrote in a statement. But to keep riders safe, the e-scooter company has increased the frequency at which it cleans its e-scooters, and is offering hourly employees an additional five days of paid wellness leave on top of existing sick pay. Should warehouses suspend operations due to coronavirus or government order, Spin said it would continue to pay furloughed hourly workers up to four weeks. In addition to halting its “kicks” e-scooter service, Scoot also paused its moped rental operation. “We will continue our close dialogue with city officials and will again offer our safe, clean transportation alternative as soon as possible. Until then, we wish everyone an abundance of health and well being,” wrote a Scoot spokesperson. Lime’s service pause wasn’t just in San Francisco but in much of the world. The company began “winding down” its service in Austria, Israel, Greece, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Bulgaria, and other markets around the world, according to a company blog. It maintains open operations in a handful of countries, including Australia and the United Arab Emirates. “Loving cities means protecting them too. For now, we’re pausing Lime service to help people stay put and stay safe,” the company wrote in a blog post Tuesday. While Jump did pause its e-scooter operations and began to remove its e-scooters from the streets Tuesday, it still will offer its 250 e-bikes for rental, an Uber spokesperson said, albeit with a reduced service area that mostly covers The City’s East side, from part of the Bayview and Excelsior and up north to Presidio Heights, bordered by Golden Gate Park’s western edge.",https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/coronavirus-pushes-sf-e-scooter-companies-to-pause-operations/
"Scooters temporarily quit SF streets, but one company refuses to roll away",Curbed San Francisco,Curbed,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,3,20,"Scooters temporarily quit SF streets, but one company refuses to roll away. Only Spin remains in operation during SF’s shelter-in-place order. During the rare instances when San Franciscans venture onto streets during the statewide shelter-in-place order, there will be one more thing conspicuously missing from the cityscape: three out of the four e-scooter peddlers. Three scooter companies—Lime, Jump, and Scoot—have discontinued service in SF. The only holdout, Spin, will continue to operate. On Tuesday, Lime announced that it will cancel all service across the United States, and in 22 other countries. The company says it’s pausing service to confront emerging health risks from COVID-19. The company will remain in operation in only nine cities worldwide, most of them in Australia and New Zealand. On Thursday, local competitor Scoot followed suit, announcing it will temporarily halt service in San Francisco. Jump, owned by SF-based Uber, also yanked its fleet of scooters this week. Lime cited a need to keep workers and customers safe as the reason for its suspension, while Scoot made references to impacts of the novel coronavirus outbreak. That leaves one company, Spin, still rolling on SF’s quiet streets. Spin has tried to frame its decision to stay in business in as heroic terms as possible, saying that “access to essential transportation is more important than ever” during the shelter-in-place orders. Last week, Spin’s founders noted on its blog that the company will clean its vehicles more often and instruct riders to sanitize handlebars before riding. While e-scooters may not be the first thing people think of when it comes to essential transportation, San Francisco Examiner reports that the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency has licensed scooter vendors to keep operating during the “stay at home” orders, meaning that the departure of Spin’s competitors is all their own idea. The ongoing shelter-in-place order has all but erased most of SF’s standard transit realities, with car use and public transit reduced to a fraction of what they were just weeks ago. Prior to the issuing of the current health orders, Spin said that its ridership was up significantly on Market Street after the closure of the downtown byway to most vehicle traffic, citing a 30 percent increase from January to February. At the time, other scooter companies declined to comment when Curbed SF asked whether they’d observed similar upticks in use.",https://sf.curbed.com/2020/3/20/21167576/e-scooters-shelter-coronavirus-spin-san-francisco-sf
"Lime, Segway hit with SF lawsuit claiming negligence caused scooter injuries",San Francisco Chronicle,San Francisco Chronicle,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2020,8,19,"Lime, Segway hit with SF lawsuit claiming negligence caused scooter injuries. San Francisco scooter-rental company Lime and scooter maker Segway are facing a lawsuit filed in San Francisco on behalf of dozens of riders who say they were injured because of faulty and improperly maintained devices. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of nearly 50 people who say they suffered broken bones, head trauma, smashed teeth and other injuries from a failure to properly maintain scooters they say were also poorly manufactured. The white-and-green scooters first appeared in 2018 on San Francisco streets and sidewalks and have become a common sight in the Bay Area and around the world. Users unlock them with a smartphone app for a fee. “Lime’s highest priority is the safety of our riders and we take seriously any claims of injuries on our products,” a Lime spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We have received and are reviewing the claims made in this lawsuit. As the global leader in micromobility, Lime works tirelessly to ensure our riders are fully secure on our scooters and bikes.” Lime has invested in safety by instructing riders on the best ways to use the scooters through its Respect the Ride initiative, which includes giving away 250,000 free helmets. Segway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The suit alleges Segway manufactured the scooters with insufficient safety features and that Lime distributed the devices on streets across the country but failed to keep them in safe working order, leading to faulty brakes, throttles, wheels, handles and other issues. According to the lawsuit, the injuries happened in California, Ohio, Arizona, Washington, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Nevada, Kentucky and the District of Columbia. Lime also employs workers to pick up and charge the electric scooters and put them back into service. The lawsuit claims these workers are not paid until a scooter is put back into service and are not paid if they tell the company a scooter has problems that need to be fixed, leading to defective scooters being put back onto streets. A UCSF study from earlier this year found electric scooter-related injuries that required hospitalization have more than tripled over five years across the U.S, although the study did not look at owned versus rented scooters and was not specific to San Francisco. Bay Area cities have scrambled to regulate scooters like those available from Lime on streets. San Francisco has taken some of the strictest controls, limiting the number of companies and vehicles allowed to operate on city streets through a pilot program. Other companies besides Lime that are allowed to operate scooters under the San Francisco program include Scoot, Bird and Spin. In January, Lime CEO Brad Bao said the company would lay off 14% of its workforce in 12 markets across the globe with an eye toward becoming profitable in 2020. Uber recently invested in Lime and shut down its Jump bike and scooter subsidiary, whose assets were folded into Lime.",https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Lime-Segway-hit-with-SF-lawsuit-claiming-15496412.php

In addition, scooters can't be ridden faster than 15 m.p.h. The city also said it would prohibit people from riding scooters in streets where the speed limit is more than 35 m.p.h. Dan Gallagher of the Charlotte Department of Transportation said the city wants the scooters to thrive, in part because the city believes they can help solve what's known as the ""first mile-last mile"" problem in transit. The city wants to make sure that the scooters aren't just concentrated in affluent areas like South End and uptown. The proposal would require scooter companies to place 20 percent of their fleet in low-income areas, though officials haven't yet determined where those areas would be. Council members are scheduled to vote on the regulations Jan. 14. Charlotte's e-scooter use peaked in August, with a little more than 142,000 trips for an average of 6.1 trips a day for each scooter. The city said the average trip length was 1.4 miles. Right now, the companies Lime and Bird each have 400 scooters, and the company Spin is replacing its bikes with scooters.

Lime electric scooters have come to Charlotte. Here is where to find them.,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,5,8,"Lime electric scooters have come to Charlotte. Here is where to find them. In a sign that Charlotte may be a successful city for dockless ride-share bikes, one company here is bringing electric scooters to the city. Lime (formerly called LimeBike) is launching scooter service in Charlotte, with demonstrations Tuesday at the Bland Street light-rail station from 11 a.m. to noon. The electric scooters cost $1 to unlock plus 15 cents per minute and are unlocked with a cellphone app. That’s more expensive than the regular price of dockless bikes, which is $1 for 30 minutes. The bikes — and scooters — can be left anywhere. Lime said Charlotte is the third city on the East Coast that will get the electric scooters, after Washington, D.C., in March and Miami in April. You need a driver’s license to use the scooters, which have a 20-mile range and can reach nearly 15 mph. The company has also launched or tested scooters in San Diego, Austin, San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles. Sidney McLaurin, Lime’s regional general manager, said the scooters would “enhance mobility to local businesses and reduce car traffic downtown.” Lime said it “encourages” people to ride the scooters in the street. Since November, the city of Charlotte has welcomed four companies as part of a pilot program to test whether bike-sharing will work. The number of trips and the amount of miles ridden have increased each month. In March, people took just under 27,000 trips on about 2,000 bikes that have been scattered around uptown and South End. The average trip was 24 minutes, according to the city. The other companies are Ofo, Spin and MoBike.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article210659229.html

The easy and inexpensive bikes are available for anyone to rent for a small fee. Now, the same company is bringing a similar experience to Queen City travelers: electric scooters. Charlotte will be the first North Carolina city to welcome electric scooter sharing starting Tuesday. “Any time we can add a different mode of transportation for people and give people better accessibility to modes of transportation is a win,” said Charlotte City Councilman Larken Egleston. The scooters will be available starting at 11 a.m. Tuesday at the South End light rail station. Just like Lime Bike, Lime S costs only $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute you ride.

The city said the scooters had to be off the streets by the end of Friday. NBC Charlotte spoke with several city leaders who all seem to be in favor of the scooters but say that doesn’t mean Lime can just launch them without any kind of regulation. “It’s frustrating when a company decides that it doesn’t want to follow the rules,” city councilman Larken Egleston said.

The city said Lime ignored those processes. In an email, the company said it's working with local businesses to place the scooters on private property. But that doesn’t account for riders discarding the scooters on public sidewalks or streets after use. Charlotte isn’t the only city with a scooter problem.

Electric Scooters Cleared To Run On Charlotte Streets,WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2018,5,21,"Electric Scooters Cleared To Run On Charlotte Streets. Electric rental scooters are now legal in Charlotte. Three companies have gotten city permits to begin deploying scooters around uptown beginning Monday - after one started without permission. First, it was dockless rental bikes. Now, it's motorized two-wheeled scooters from Bird, Lime and Spin. They're appearing under a pilot program that's running parallel to the dockless bike trial already underway. The formal launch comes after Lime put out its scooters a few weeks ago without a permit, said City Council member Tariq Bokhari. ""Those who have been following Scooter-gate in the news over the last week or so will recognize that we had a bit of a challenge with one of the companies jumping out and prematurely putting their scooters on the streets, while we were still working through the pilot permitting process,"" Bokhari said. The city ordered Lime to remove the scooters by May 11, which it did. Lime also asked users to email city officials, and Bokhari and other council members were flooded with complaints about the city's move. Lime apparently hoped to run the program without a permit. A spokeswoman told The Charlotte Observer last week it planned to ""distribute scooters on private properties, not in the public right of way or obstructing any sidewalks."" The company also got into trouble in Honolulu, Hawaii, last week after it began deploying scooters there without city permission. In an emailed, statement Monday afternoon, Lime said: ""We filed for our permit today, and appreciate the City’s collaborative efforts in working to approve our application in a timely manner. We expect to resume scooter operations by tomorrow morning, and look forward to serving the community of Charlotte with our scooters again."" Since last week, the city has written rules for a five-month trial. If a company like Lime also operates dockless bikes, it can deploy up to 100 scooters initially. Companies without bikes get up to 300. The city will monitor the program and decide in October whether to tweak the permits. Bokhari said the trial comes with incentives for good behavior. ""We're going to have kind of a race to the top, with three categories where each month we're going to measure them. One is ridership. One is the right of way, and how they're respecting that and using it. And the other is responsiveness to the community's concerns,"" Bokhari said. Companies that score best get an extra 100 scooters, he said. The scooters are part of efforts by the city to expand transportation options. ""Bike share certainly, but also the scooters to some extent for certain folks provide that last-mile, first-mile connectivity that might get someone from their house or their place of work to a light rail station or to a bus stop,"" city council member Larken Egleston said. Just like rental bikes, you pay for the scooters with a smartphone app. They cost a dollar to unlock, plus a per-minute charge.

Op-Ed: Dockless scooters are back on the streets of Charlotte today. 3 reasons I’m not excited,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,5,21,"Op-Ed: Dockless scooters are back on the streets of Charlotte today. 3 reasons I’m not excited. Editor’s Note: Lime, a California-based bike-sharing company, rolled out a fleet of electric scooters in Charlotte on May 8. The program was promptly shut down by the city within 24 hours for launching without a permit. Scooter drama ensued with scooter fans flooding the inboxes of city council members with pleas to return them to the streets. Over the last week, the city has come to an agreement with Lime and two other providers — Bird and Spin — that allows the addition of 300 scooters to CDOT’s in-progress Shared Mobility Pilot Program, effective today. What follows is one writer’s take on the cons of Charlotte’s new electric scooters. Have a different take? Send us your opinion. As of today, Charlotte is the new home to 300 (city approved) electronic scooters. WE WON! Our email campaign to city council was a success! Lime Scooters for everyone! Not so fast. While I love annoying city council members as much as the next guy, I’m not sure these scooters are the best thing for our city. I know you want to have some fun and re-live your childhood as you scoot through Uptown, but please read this before you jump on the next Lime, Bird or Spin scooter you see. Here are three reasons why I’m not sold on the new dockless scooters: 1. The rules aren’t clear. The scooter companies advise riding in bike lanes and on roadways, but the city has set 0 restrictions and 100% of the people I’ve seen riding the scooters (before they were confiscated) were on sidewalks. So where are you supposed to ride these things? Apparently, wherever the hell you want. Bike lane? Go for it. Major roadway? Have fun. Busy sidewalk? Enjoy slamming into everyone’s ankles. No one’s going to stop you. 2. They’re a pedestrian’s worst nightmare. I’m already having trouble running on Charlotte’s sidewalks with the dockless bikes strewn about like trash. Adding 300 scooters is going to make navigating our neighborhood sidewalks feel like a poorly planned obstacle course. Oh, and just wait until someone gets run down by a distracted (or worse, inebriated) scooterist. It’s bound to happen, and it better not be me. 3. They are death traps. Lime scooters go a max of 14.8mph, the same approximate speed as a commuter bicyclist. Seems standard, right? Sure, except most of us have been riding a bike since we were five. I’m willing to bet 99% of Charlotteans have never stepped foot on an electronic scooter and no matter how easy it is, there will be a learning curve. And don’t think you’re being safe by staying on the sidewalk. It’s a well-known fact that Charlotte has some of the most treacherous sidewalks in the world. Add that to the fact that no one is scooting with a helmet, and you’ve got an accident waiting to happen. Still think there’s no risk? Then why do California injury lawyers (where Lime is based) have webpages dedicated solely to LimeBike and Lime-S electronic scooter injuries? If you still feel a need to ride one of these brightly colored death traps, please go slow, avoid busy roadways and for the love of god, wear a helmet.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/128050/dockless-scooters-are-back-on-the-streets-of-charlotte-today-3-reasons-im-not-excited/
Exec Says Lime Thought It Had City's Blessing For Scooters,WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2018,5,23,"Exec Says Lime Thought It Had City's Blessing For Scooters. Officials with the scooter and bike rental company Lime say they thought they had the support of city leaders when they introduced their electric scooters uptown in early May — without a permit. That wasn't the case, and the company had to pull scooters off the streets. This week, Lime got its permit, as did two other scooter companies — Bird and Spin. Sidney McLaurin oversees Lime's electric scooter and dockless bicycle programs in North Carolina. In an interview, he said the company has had a good relationship with Charlotte officials. “And continuing that relationship, we had conversations with the city and several business leaders in the city prior to launching scooters,"" McLaurin said. ""And so when we originally launched them, we felt that we had the support to go ahead and launch them. “After the launch, we had some other conversations with the city and their request was that we give them some time to actually work on an official permit,"" McLaurin continued. ""From their perspective that would be a sort of cleaner way to manage it. And so we agreed to a 10-day hold on services until they had time to do the permit process. “So that permit is now officially done and we are back on the street,” he said. McLaurin says Lime expects to have 100 scooters deployed by this weekend. PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE Charlotte isn't the only city where the company has gotten into hot water. In Honolulu two weeks ago, the mayor declared Lime's scooters illegal and workers began removing them from the streets. The problem is that in most places, the law doesn't say anything about motorized scooters. Are they bicycles? Mopeds? Technically, companies like Lime can say they aren't breaking any rules. “There really isn't anything that's a clear parallel,” McLaurin said. “What we are doing in a lot of these places, and really all these places, is having collaborative discussions with the cities to understand how can we best classify this as something that makes sense.” He said the company hasn’t been able to come up with one solution that works across all its markets. Besides Charlotte, Lime now offers rental scooters in San Diego, Washington, D.C., Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, Austin and Honolulu. (In Honolulu, they’re still working things out with the city.) Lime and city officials agree on one thing, says McLaurin: some people want scooters to get around more easily without cars. ""When the scooters came out, we had about a thousand rides over the first three days,"" he said. ""I think that's sort of encapsulates the main point, is that you know we want to figure out ways that people can get around that are not cars. And so we will continue to work with the city on how we can improve the permit, you know how we can change it."" McLaurin said the scooters' popularity before the service was halted in early May show there's demand in Charlotte. ""This is something that really has the potential to change the way people get around Charlotte and really how they get around major cities in the United States,"" he said. Officially, electric scooters in Charlotte are on a five-month trial.

Looking to ride a scooter, but now sure how it works? Here’s a quick Agenda beginner’s guide, to get you scooting, fast. Last week, the city has come to an agreement with Lime and two other providers — Bird and Spin — that allows the addition of 300 scooters to CDOT’s in-progress Shared Mobility Pilot Program. Here’s a step-by-step guide using Lime’s scooters as an example. The cost for the Lime scooter ride is $1 to unlock plus 15 cents per minute spent on the scooter. OK, here’s the 10 step process. Step 1: Download the app in the app store. Before you can start trying out the Lime scooter, you will first need to download the application “LimeBike.” You can find this in the App Store of your mobile device. lime-bike-ios-app-charlotte Step 2: Add your phone number. Now that you have the app, it will ask you to put in your mobile phone number. lime-app-to-use-scooters-charlotte Step 3: So THAT’S why they needed our number… You will receive a text message with a four-digit code that you will type into the spaces provided in the Lime App. lime-app-to-use-scooters-charlotte Step 4: Locate your scooter. After allowing Lime to access your location, you will be placed onto a map where you can see the several Lime bikes and Lime scooters in your area. Once you locate the best scooter for you, go get it. scooters-on-lime-mobile-map-charlotte Step 5: Find your scooter. After following the map on your mobile app, you will find your scooter and you can start your ride. They will most likely be in an urban area close to Uptown. lime-scooters-charlotte Step 6: Scan the QR code. Upon scooter arrival, you will want to click on the scooter icon within the app and then press the button on the bottom of the screen “Unlock Ride.” The app will then ask for you to enable camera access, which you will accept in order to scan the code. The QR code is located between the two handlebars. handlebars-lime-scooter-charlotte Step 7: Verify your payment. You will then be asked to share your credit card information with the app so that you can pay for your ride. The cost for the Lime scooter ride is $1 to unlock plus 15 cents per minute spent on the scooter. payment-on-lime-scooters Step 8: Get to know your scooter anatomy. There is a “Go” button located on the right handlebar and a brake handle on the left side that you will want to squeeze to slow down. In the center of the handlebars will be a monitor that shows your speed, distance traveled, and distance left to ride. Since Lime scooters aren’t sidewalk permitted, you will need to ride your scooter on the road and follow all of the laws of the road. Although not required, you should wear a helmet. handlebar-of-lime-scooter-to-go-faster-or-slower-charlotte Step 9: Start the scooter. Once you are on a road, you can start your ride. However, you need to start with a slight push. While keeping one foot steady on the scooter, push off the other foot to start your smooth acceleration. Then, you can begin using the “Go” button which will send you riding forward. (Don’t worry; you won’t be going extremely fast). riding-lime-scooter Step 10: End your ride. Once you have gotten to your destination or are finished riding the scooter, you’re supposed to park the scooter in a location that is easily accessible for other riders. After safely parking, you will go back onto your app and end your ride. You will want to confirm this so you aren’t charged extra for your ride.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/128539/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-ride-new-scooters-in-charlotte/
"Yes, you can get a DUI on a Lime scooter (Charlotte)",WCNC,NBC,"Charlotte, NC",2018,5,30,"Yes, you can get a DUI on a Lime scooter. Denver Public Works, meanwhile, is trying to develop regulations for things like Lime scooters. If you happened to be in downtown Denver this weekend, you might have noticed a few hundred green, motorized residents that have descended on the town and are either the best or worst things to have ever happened to the Mile High City. No, we’re not talking about Californians (that was a joke, don’t @ me). Instead, we’re talking about Lime scooters. And if your weekend travels happened to take you to areas such as the breweries in River North, you might have considered the possibility that some of the folks who paid $1 to unlock these new transportation devices (and $0.15 for each ensuing minute) might have had something to drink. So, we asked the Denver Police Department the obvious question: can you get a DUI on a Lime scooter? Sgt. Josh White said yes. It’s just like how you can get a DUI on a bike. Of course, this led to more questions: has anyone actually been arrested or cited for riding a Lime scooter under the influence? Have there been any reported injuries? DPD said they’d try to find out and get back to us. We sent an email with multiple follow-up questions and will post a follow-up report. But in the meantime, take this as a warning: don’t drink and ride Lime scooters. For what it’s worth, Lime scooters can only be ridden on the sidewalks, and not in the bike lanes or streets unless they’re crossing an intersection, according to Denver Public Works. Denver Public Works said it will remove scooters left in the middle of the sidewalk, so park them appropriately. The department also said the city is developing new rules to regulate activities like the scooter-sharing service and it aims to put them into effect in the very short term.",https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/local/yes-you-can-get-a-dui-on-a-lime-scooter/275-559824198
'Saw a guy riding down the sidewalk... texting on his phone.' Here come the scooters.,WBTV,CBS,"Charlotte, NC",2018,6,15,"'Saw a guy riding down the sidewalk... texting on his phone.' Here come the scooters. The sidewalks of uptown Charlotte have a new hum these days: the whisper of electric scooters, dozens of them, unleashed last month by a city experiment in new ways of getting around town. The little two-wheelers in uptown, South End and a few other Charlotte neighborhoods are as novel as the first escalators would be in a small town. But as hipsters and businessmen alike whiz past bank towers and 70,000 uptown workers, a debate is already forming. Are scooters also accidents waiting to happen? E-scooters are neither motor vehicles, bound to the street, nor pedestrian. They go about 15 miles an hour, a speed that is five times faster than the average walking pace and startling even to riders. ""This thing has got a lot of torque to it, I'm a little surprised there,"" first-time rider Chelton Mitchell, 40, said during a pause down a sidewalk on College Street this week. ""It's too fast but at the same time it's real controllable, it's got a good brake system on it. ... I heard they were giving out helmets for free. I would definitely use one."" The scooters are so new to Charlotte that police don't collect specific data on them, including accident reports, but riders have been seriously hurt in some of the dozen or more cities where they're used. In Charlotte, scooters are a recent addition to a pilot program, intended as an alternative way to make short trips, that began last November and runs through October. Vendors were allowed to scatter hundreds of bicycles that can be rented through a smartphone app and simply left at the destination. Electric scooters work the same way. But while the program spells out where to park scooters — on or near city-owned sidewalks, leaving room for walkers — the city has no enforceable rules on how and where they're ridden. It's illegal to ride bicycles on crowded center-city sidewalks, for example, but Charlotte has no such ordinance on electric scooters. ""Right now we're being flexible and learning, and our message is that everyone should be practicing safety first,"" said Amy Mitchell of the city transportation department. ""That means wearing helmets at all times and obeying all traffic laws, including traffic signals"" such as pedestrian walk signs. Both the companies that have deployed scooters, Lime and Bird, require riders to be 18 and have driver's licenses. Both recommend that riders wear helmets, and tell customers to ride in bike lanes or roadways, not sidewalks. Few users appear to read the fine print. Most scooter riders in uptown Charlotte ride the sidewalks and without helmets. ""Saw a guy riding down the sidewalk on an electric scooter texting on his phone,"" Charlottean Katie Monson wrote in response to an Observer Facebook post. ""Oh, and I was in front of Discovery Place with my 3-year-old. Are they vehicles or are they pedestrians? Vehicles belong on the road and have to follow car rules. I'd love to see rules on use and then have them enforced."" Added reader Julian Cuthbertson: ""You are not supposed to be on the sidewalk, you are supposed to wear a helmet, and you are supposed to be a licensed driver. The app asks for a valid ID when renting. All three of those rules are broken daily when I'm uptown."" Riders, in turn, say the speedy freewheelers are both useful and enjoyable. ""I just want to have a little fun once or twice a week,"" Pablo Escudero, 45, said as he unlocked a Lime scooter at the Square. ""It just brings the kid out of me in a way, you know?"" Matthew Walls, 26, rides from home in South End to his job uptown at Wells Fargo, turning a 15-minute walk into a five-minute scoot. ""When it's crowded you have to, like, weave in and out"" on the sidewalk, he said. Patrick Marseille, 46, who works in special transportation for the Charlotte Area Transit System, hops a scooter almost daily from his North Davidson job to an uptown gym during the time between his split morning and afternoon shifts. For a little more than $1 a trip, the scooter saves him from buying a bike, worrying about theft and 20 minutes each way. But Marseille, who used to ride motorcycles, also sees trouble lurking. The scooters are ""very fast,"" he said, and best ridden by those with some familiarity with them. He found that the brake lever, for instance, takes all four fingers to fully depress. ""You can ride one of these and if you're not used to the speed or how to brake properly, someone could easily ride right into oncoming traffic and obviously get killed — and it probably will happen,"" Marseille said. ""But does that stop anybody from getting into an automobile, knowing how many people die per year, or a plane? No. It's going to happen eventually. Somebody's going to die eventually with these (scooters) being everywhere, and the carelessness of a cell phone and someone driving, that's a cocktail for someone dying eventually."" Injuries and shutdowns E-scooters have already caught some unintended publicity in California, where Bird and Lime launched, and in cities including Charlotte. The companies are each permitted to place up to 300 scooters on Charlotte streets. City officials say it's hard to know how many are available at any one time because the scooters are collected for recharging and moved around where they're needed. Lime's lime-green scooters appeared in early May — but without permission to store them on city sidewalks, city officials said in ordering the company to stop operating after the first day. Riders flooded the email in-boxes of city council members and the issue was later resolved. Bird, which launched nationally last September and is in 14 U.S. cities, deployed scooters in Charlotte's uptown, South End, Belmont, Ashley Park and Optimist Park neighborhoods on May 26. The company bills itself as a solution for trips too long to walk and too short to drive. A third company, Spin, is part of the pilot program but hasn't placed scooters in Charlotte. The companies' fast launch has been a little too fast for some cities. ast week, San Francisco ordered hundreds of scooters off its streets, at least temporarily, saying Bird, Lime and Spin had started operations without permits. Pedestrians had complained about the vehicles being ridden and parked on sidewalks, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Austin, Texas and Nashville, Tenn., have issued similar orders. Riders have also been hurt aboard the scooters. Last month a Bird rider in Santa Monica, Calif., near Bird's Venice headquarters, went to the hospital with head injuries. The rider wasn't wearing a helmet and didn't stop at an intersection, a news report said. In January, the Santa Monica Daily Press reported, another rider was hurt after running a stop sign and hitting a vehicle. Santa Monica sued Bird for operating without a business license, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The company paid $300,000 in fines and began offering helmets to riders, the newspaper said, and Santa Monica started aggressively ticketing those riding on sidewalks. ""Ideally we want to educate people,"" Bird spokesman Kenneth Baer told the newspaper. ""But we can't monitor everything people do once they get a Bird."" Two more Bird scooter riders who weren't wearing helmets were critically injured in a Nashville hit-and-run crash last month, a week after the company's launch there. Joshua Rollins, an uptown Charlotte bike police officer, says he's seen some near-collisions by zooming scooter riders but can't order them off crowded sidewalks. Scooters occupy such a legal gray area, he said, that officers wonder how they would charge a rider who's at fault. Would a drunken scooter rider be more similar to one behind the wheel of a car or of a golf cart? ""It's only going to take one person getting hurt"" to force more regulation, Rollins said. The Charlotte Department of Transportation says it will soon start an online community survey to see what the public thinks about the scooters, as it has for the shared-bike program. Lime and Bird say they coach riders on safely using their scooters through tutorials on their apps. Bird offers helmets to riders who ask for one through its app and at giveaway events. The company says it's committed to picking up its vehicles each night to prevent them from littering public spaces. ""Safety ambassadors"" in Charlotte do local rider education and move about the community to make sure scooters are ridden and parked safely, said spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn. ""We instruct our riders to use bike lanes where available or on the street and to avoid riding on sidewalks. Similarly, Birds are to be parked out of the public way and near bike racks,"" Hahn said. Lime operations manager C.J. Shaw said the company offers safety tips on its mobile app, on social media and at in-person demos at community events. ""We're also currently testing ways to encourage both responsible parking and safe riding practices, like having riders take a picture of the way their scooter is parked before ending their ride,"" Shaw said. ""We plan to continue testing methods of promoting proper usage of our scooters so that we can best and most safely serve the Charlotte community.""",https://www.wbtv.com/story/38432595/saw-a-guy-riding-down-the-sidewalk-texting-on-his-phone-here-come-the-scooters

It's been about a month since electric scooters rolled out on Charlotte streets. There are some safety concerns with the scooters Scooter companies are reminding riders about rules to follow when riding scooters The city is not aware of any injuries related to scooters as of now Riders say they are a hit but there are some safety concerns. The scooters can climb to speeds up to 15 miles per hour. When you add cars, bikes and people trying to walk it can become potentially dangerous. It's why scooter companies are reminding riders about the rules; riders must wear a helmet, be over 18, have a driver's license and follow the traffic laws. “Rider education and rider safety and pedestrian safety is something that is incredibly important to us and so that's something we're continuing to push as we grow this program,” said Lime Charlotte Operations Manager CJ Shaw. Lime said its bike ridership has actually grown since it added the scooters. The scooters and rental bikes are part of a pilot program by the city. It wraps up at the end of October.

The problem with scooters isn’t that we have too many — it’s that we need thousands more,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,6,19,"The problem with scooters isn’t that we have too many — it’s that we need thousands more. Our city has about 500 dockless scooters, but we need thousands more. The Charlotte Department of Transportation is running an electronic scooter pilot program to collect feedback on rentable scooter services. The pilot program, which ends in October, allows a maximum of 300 scooters for participating companies. Currently, Lime and Bird are both permitted to deploy up to 300 electric scooters. Spin has not yet deployed any scooters in Charlotte (although they’re coming). Side note: Bird is seeking to raise money at a $2 billion valuation, even though they’re a young company. Smart money is investing in scooters and they’re unlikely to go away. Given that we only have about 500 scooters and most are in Uptown and South End, dockless scooters are currently more of a novelty than a consistently reliable transportation option. As our city grows, we need to decide if want to continue to be so damn car dependent. If not, it’s time to take scooters seriously. And let’s be honest, if you’ve ridden a scooter — they’re freaking awesome. I don’t know another way to describe it other than riding a scooter around town is just fun. Some scooter takes cry for regulation, complain of texting and scooting and advocate for helmets. There’s nothing wrong with these nerdy takes, but they’re just missing the point. Yes, we need to regulate scooters. You’re supposed to ride them on the roads, but everybody uses sidewalks. Yes, people shouldn’t text and scoot. Duh. People also shouldn’t text and drive. Or drink and drive. But cars are still out there. At a certain point, we have to accept personal responsibility. Yes, helmets are a good idea. Especially since many Charlotte drivers are used to owning the roads and don’t give a crap about bikers and scooters. But overall, these takes are missing the larger picture — a liquid, dockless scooter market has the opportunity to take thousands of cars off the road and ease traffic congestion in Charlotte. According to data from the DMV, Charlotte is home to 401,460 vehicles. Mecklenburg County has 808,870 total vehicles. We just love our cars. What happens next with scooters? City Council and CDOT staff will collaborate on the evaluation of the pilot program and determine the next steps. I’ve been impressed by CDOT’s lean startup-ish approach here. According to CDOT, at the end of their current electronic scooter pilot program (October 2018), one of the following outcomes will likely happen : Prohibiting rentable scooters in the public right-of-way. Creating regulations that would allow multiple scooter companies to operate in Charlotte. Hiring a vendor and developing a city-owned scooter program. Extending the pilot program to provide more time to evaluate Charlotte’s options. Let’s hope that this November, instead of laughing at scooter novelty and letting the program die, thousands of scooters are cruising our streets — filling the gaps between our destination and existing public transportation infrastructure.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/131351/the-problem-with-scooters-isnt-that-we-have-too-many-its-that-we-need-thousands-more/
Charlotte's scooters can help you make money while you sleep. Here's how.,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,6,20,"Charlotte's scooters can help you make money while you sleep. Here's how. Jaciel Sojo has been charging electric scooters in Charlotte for about a month. The 23-year-old found out about the gig when he saw an ad on Craigslist that said he could make around $100 a night. He applied to be a charger before the scooters hit the city's streets. Since their arrival, he said he's been raking in at least $60 a day. When he told his older brother, 26-year-old Joan Sojo, about his side hustle, Joan started charging scooters, too. Joan earned $10 on his first day. On his fourth day, he made $96. Now, they're both hooked. Jaciel and Joan said they are in the music business and make extra money servicing scooters. They can get $5 to $20 per scooter, depending on how hard it is to find. They charge for Bird, one of two companies that scattered scooters across the city in late May. The other is Lime. Charlotte gave a third company —Spin — permission to bring electric scooters into the city, but it has yet to put any out. Between the two companies, there are 400 scooters in Charlotte, at most, according to the city's website. The two-wheelers can go up to 15 mph, and they both cost the same: $1 to start plus 15 cents for each minute, their websites said. Both companies have rolled out scooters in dozens of other cities, including San Francisco, Austin, and Washington, D.C. Anyone 18 or older can sign up to be a charger. The process starts with filling out a form on the companies' app or website. Bird and Lime work with their chargers in similar ways, said Ronald Applewhite, who charges scooters for both companies. However, he prefers charging Lime scooters because they're easier to find. ""Those are the first ones I look for,"" he said. On a typical night, the 48-year-old collects 15 to 20 scooters and makes about $200. Applewhite said he is a freelance cable installer, but he's thinking about charging scooters full-time. Joan, who only charges for Bird, usually picks up three scooters at a time. But he often sees other chargers gathering dozens. “We see people in cargo vans, like 14-passenger vans, who take the seats out and stack them up,” he said. It was tempting at first to go after the $20 scooters, Jaciel said, but he’s learned that it’s not worth his time to go into an office or apartment building to track down a rogue scooter. ""For me to park, go upstairs and find it — which might take 20 minutes — I can go find six or seven scooters and make double,” he said. Scooters collected from around the city are inspected for maintenance, charged — It can take three to six hours per scooter, depending on battery level, Joan said — and returned in neat rows at specific drop off locations before 7 a.m. each day. Bird and Lime declined to comment on how many chargers are active in the Charlotte area. To Joan, it seems like there are more chargers in the city every day. Sometimes he pulls up to a scooter just in time to watch another charger take it away, Joan said. Other times, it disappears from the map while he’s on the way. But some chargers are willing to put up with the competition because they enjoy the work. ""I like being outdoors. I like not having a boss,"" Applewhite said. ""It's freedom.""",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/article213081819.html
I rode a Bird scooter 14 miles in one day. Here’s what I learned,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,6,27,"I rode a Bird scooter 14 miles in one day. Here’s what I learned. I absolutely love the controversial new electric scooters that hit the streets of Charlotte back in May so I decided to spend an entire day on one — no car, no Lyft, no bikes, no public transportation. All scooter. It’s not that the scooters are designed to fully replace any other traditional mode of transportation. In fact, they’re positioned to bridge the gap for short trips between existing infrastructure — from your house to a bus stop or a bus stop to the light rail, for example. And, let’s be real, they’re little more than a Sunday Funday brewery-hopping novelty for a lot of people. But since I live a mile from Uptown and rarely venture outside about a 5-mile radius, I decided to do a little experiment to see what it’s like to be a full-time scooter commuter. Short story: It’s awesome. I rode Bird all day and covered 14 miles in 7 separate trips totaling 2 hours of on-scooter time. It cost me $25. Yes, I wore a helmet and, yes, I stayed off the sidewalks (90% of the time). Here are some field notes for an all-day scooter experience… You have to pack light – Without bike luxuries like a basket, rack or cupholder, everything you need has to be strapped to your body. I usually travel with a backpack, gym bag, lunch bag and purse and just use my car trunk as storage all day. For the scooter, I had to condense it all down into just my backpack — and it was heavy. I had a mile walk from my house to get to my first scooter – Unless you live right in the heart of Uptown, don’t expect to find a scooter outside your door — especially first thing in the morning when they’ve all been charged and placed back in central locations. It took me 15-20 minutes to get to my first Bird. When I’m in NYC, I’ll easily clock 10+ miles of walking in a day, but in Charlotte the one-mile stroll feels like a burden somehow. I neglected to charge my phone, the thing that powers the entire scooter experience, the night before – I don’t usually think about charging since the iPhone X battery lasts 100 years and I can always plug my phone in while I’m in my car. But with Bird, I had to have it juiced up to unlock the scooter, pay and track my ride. I ended up pulling out my laptop in a parking lot at one point and plugging in to charge that way. Amateur. Scooters absolutely belong on the road – With a few exceptions, I kept my scooter commute off the sidewalks but at my discretion — much the same way I commute on a bike. I hopped on the sidewalk when I got anywhere near an I-277 on ramp and when I felt it would ease the flow of traffic behind me if I got out of the way to let cars pass before moving back into a break in the line. In those instances, I was on sidewalks without pedestrians. If there was a bike lane, I used it. The official rule, of course, is that scooters have to be used on roads, but very few people abide by that rule. There is never a reason to be on a scooter on a crowded sidewalk in Uptown or South End. While it’s important to get new scooter riders up to speed on the importance of being on the road, it’s also important to remind drivers that they, just like bikes, have a right to be there. The fear of someone taking my scooter almost negated the fun of scooter commuting – It’s no big deal to park a scooter Uptown and return to find it gone. There will be another one around the corner. But when I got just a tad bit farther out and had the lone scooter in Elizabeth as my primary mode of transportation with a storm rolling in, you better believe I was stressing. I passed on grabbing coffee at Earl’s for fear that someone else would unlock it and zip off with my only hope for getting home before the rain. Pro Tip: You can actually lock your scooter and keep the clock running without ending your ride. This continues to charge you and makes it unavailable to other riders. I didn’t know this was an option until afterwards. Brutal summer heat is surprisingly bearable on a scooter as long as you’re moving – The scooters are quick (about 15mph max) so I caught a nice breeze most of the time. And since I wasn’t exerting any effort to pedal, I was as comfortable as you could be outside in Charlotte all day in late June. Just wear a damn helmet – Again, this is a rule required by law that no one follows and I think you’re out of your mind for it. I look at the scooters the exact same way I do a bike and I would never get on a bike without a helmet. Scooters are pricey – Though the cost of individual rides seems nominal, a full day on a scooter really adds up. You’ll pay $1 to unlock and $0.15 per minute after that. My 7 rides cost me $25, which is considerably more than I’d spend on gas or a bus pass. But again, I was using the scooter as full-time transportation, which isn’t its intended purpose. I’d love to see Bird offer a monthly unlimited pass to dedicated users who plan to ride a lot. Still, if you love it that much, buying your own electric scooter is the way to go. Something similar to the Bird scooter looks like it sells for about $500. My biggest takeaway from my day of scooter commuting was that it felt almost exactly the same as bike commuting so I was extremely comfortable on the road, but most people aren’t. The only reason I felt comfortable on the road on a scooter is because I got comfortable on the road on a bike first by taking a Cycling Savvy class. I almost never rode my bike in Charlotte and refused to ride on the streets prior to taking that class. It completely changed the way I look at non-car commuting on shared roads and, although it’s different, I felt everything I learned about bikes at play while I was on the scooter. It may feel like cars own the streets in Charlotte, but they don’t. Bikes — and now scooters — belong there and have rights there too. If riders of scooters and drivers of cars would treat the new scooters like a legitimate mode of transportation and not like a novelty or a nuisance, we could find a way for them to peacefully coexist together on the streets and off your sidewalks. Oh, and in case it doesn’t go without saying, riding a scooter is extremely fun.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/132528/i-rode-a-bird-scooter-14-miles-in-one-day-heres-what-i-learned/
How to make money off the electric scooter craze by being a charger,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,6,29,"How to make money off the electric scooter craze by being a charger. You may already know that I’m not a huge fan of the new electric scooters that have taken over Charlotte’s streets. And until I see more people than just Katie Loveluck wear a helmet while riding one, my opinion won’t change. But despite my head-injury anxiety, most of my friends love the new scooters. A few of them have even found a way to turn a profit from the Charlotte scooter craze. My friends have become Bird Chargers, people who collect scooters, bring them home and then charge them overnight. (Lime also offers a charger program, but I’ve heard that they are much more selective and take almost three times as long to get back to applicants.) All you need to do to become a Bird Charger is fill out an application — they prefer people living in urban areas with SUVs, vans or trucks. If you’re hired, Bird will send you three plug-in chargers (which requires a $30 deposit) and you can begin. Interested in starting your own scooter side hustle? Here’s the good and the bad about being a Charlotte scooter charger. The good: 1. You can make decent money. Payment ranges from $5 to $20 per scooter charged, depending on how hard the Bird is to “capture.” 2. They give you a map to find scooters. I don’t know why I thought people would be aimlessly driving around looking for scooters, but this isn’t a thing. Once you’ve been approved, you can turn on “Charger Mode” on the Bird app. This is where you see scooter locations and how much they’re worth to charge. 3. Bird’s QR scanner system makes things pretty easy. The most time-consuming part of the job is tracking down the scooter, finding parking and then dragging it to your car. But once you actually “capture” the Bird, the scanning system is fast and simple. 4. You get paid fast. Not sure about Lime, but Bird deposits your money as soon as you drop off the scooter the next morning. 5. You can request more plug-in chargers for free. More chargers mean more money, so once you’ve been successfully charging for five days you can request additional chargers. 6. The Bird team is super responsive. You can message them anytime through the Bird app and they’ll get back to you within a few minutes. The bad: 1. The scooters are deceptively heavy. If you lack upper arm strength you may have trouble lifting them into your trunk. 2. You have to pick up scooters after dark (9 p.m.). This can be totally fine or totally sketchy, depending on where you live. Maybe don’t leave your car running while you’re doing a pickup? 3. You have to drop off the scooters between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. the next day, and sometimes in weird places. My friend wasn’t pleased with dropping off three scooters outside of Uptown Cabaret at 6 a.m. last week, but this is what Bird asked her to do. Also, if you wake up and late and drop off scooters after 7 a.m., Bird reduces your payment by 50%. 4. People may fight you for scooters. Since all Bird Chargers have the same map, chances are you’ll arrive at a scooter at the same time as someone else. And from what I’ve heard, chargers are not always polite. Another issue is that some people will hoard scooters until the battery dies so you can’t get to them. Seems unfair, but who’s going to stop them? 5. If you forget to return a scooter you’re screwed. Bird’s official charger agreement states “If a Bird Scooter is not returned to a Bird Nest or sent to an authorized Bird repair location within three (3) days from the date you initially picked up the Bird Scooter, it will be presumed that you will not be returning the Bird Scooter and you will be charged for the full value of the Bird Scooter ($1,000).” Being a Bird Charger isn’t for everyone (AKA anyone who doesn’t want to be awake at 6 a.m.), but if you have a large vehicle, free time in the evening and some extra space in your house, it can be a pretty nice side gig.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/132759/electric-scooter-bird-lime-charger-charlotte-nc/

"Electric scooters may be cool, but Charlotte needs to decide how they should be used",Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,7,25,"Electric scooters may be cool, but Charlotte needs to decide how they should be used. Rush hour, uptown Charlotte. It’s the usual controlled chaos of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. Most obey the traffic lights and laws. Most respect each other’s space. But now something new has been introduced to the swirl: motorized rental scooters. They slalom through Tryon Street traffic and part pedestrians on uptown sidewalks, and if that seems like a potentially dangerous thing to add to the morning mix, well, yes. In Milwaukee, a pedestrian suffered facial injuries this month when he was struck by a man riding a Bird scooter. In downtown Nashville, two women were hospitalized when the scooters they were riding were struck by a vehicle. In California, an attorney who already has handled two dozen scooter accident cases says he gets 2-5 calls a day about new incidents. Now, cities across the country are grappling with how to update ordinances to accommodate the new technology zipping around streets and sidewalks at speeds up to 15 mph. Many cities, including Charlotte, have yet to adopt new safety rules for scooters, leaving riders and police unsure of what’s allowed and what’s not. That needs to change here before someone gets seriously hurt. To be sure, the haphazardness of it all lands mostly at the feet of the scooter companies, which dumped dozens of scooters on Charlotte’s streets earlier this year without the city’s permission. That same tactic prompted some cities to temporarily ban ride-share scooters, including Milwaukee, where police slapped the rider involved in last month’s pedestrian accident with a $98.80 ticket for operating an unregistered motorized vehicle. Charlotte has taken a more conciliatory approach, adding scooters to a ride-share pilot program that runs through October. The program, however, is less about safety rules than how the companies work with the city regarding issues like clutter, Charlotte City Council member Tariq Bokhari told the editorial board this week. As for safety, Bokhari says scooter operators are treated like cyclists for now. That means they’re allowed on both sidewalks and streets, and they don’t have to wear a helmet if they’re 16 and older. Bokhari was critical of how scooter-share company Lime launched in Charlotte, but he says he’s a big fan of the technology. Scooters are convenient, he says, and they’re loved by the young professionals that cities want to attract. Still, Bokhari says the city is figuring out safety issues “on the fly.” He plans to nudge city staffers to craft new rules of the road. One question that should move to the front of the line: Are ride-share scooters even legal to operate on N.C. roads? The state of North Carolina requires that all low-speed vehicles, such as golf carts, be inspected then registered before operating on public streets and highways. Mopeds must also be registered, and they require a helmet and vehicle insurance to operate. If ride-share scooters pass muster with the state, we recommend Charlotte consider rules similar to what the city of Dallas passed last month: No riding on sidewalks in the Central Business District, and no riding on streets where the speed limit is more than 35 mph. That could move the scooters off uptown sidewalks and higher-speed streets where they might be a hazard. Let’s keep the chaos under control, and soon.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article215485590.html
"Scooters are off to a blazing start in Charlotte. 20,000+ people took total of 66,220 trips in first month",Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,7,27,"Scooters are off to a blazing start in Charlotte. 20,000+ people took total of 66,220 trips in first month. Charlotte has embraced scooters in a big way. Just one month in, more than 20,000 people have already taken 66,220 trips on electric scooters, according to June ridership data just published by the city of Charlotte. These eye-popping numbers are despite there being less than 600 electric scooters in the city, from two companies: Bird and Lime. Key scooter statistics. The average scooter rider took about three trips in the first month. The average ride lasted 14 minutes and spanned a mile and a half A total 98,000+ miles traveled on Charlotte’s e-scooters in the month of June. Those three data points come from the city of Charlotte. Now for some data from an Agenda analysis. Each scooter on Charlotte’s streets was used an average of 110 times in the month of June and ridden roughly 163 miles. Scooters brought in total revenue of about $205,000 in the first month, or around $342 per scooter. This is at the standard pricing of $1 to unlock and then 15 cents per minute. These companies have nearly made back their capital investment in the scooters in just the first month. Scooters are blowing bikes out of the water. While scooters were introduced at the end of May, dockless bike-sharing programs have been in Charlotte since November. The scooters are proving to be way more popular. Charlotteans took just 33,000 trips on dockless bikes in June, according to data from the city, less than half the number of scooter trips. And that’s with many more bikes on the road. In this pilot program, four companies are allowed a maximum of 500 bikes apiece — or 2,000 dockless bikes compared with 600 scooters. Since November, about 58,000 people have taken 191,583 total trips on dockless bikes, according to the city’s data. If scooters keep up their pace, they’ll do in three months what it took bikes 8 months to accomplish. What comes next? Undoubtedly, some of these scooter riders were just trying them out for the novelty. If the bikes are any indication, scooter will continue to bring in new riders as time passes. Nearly half of June’s bike riders were new users, according to the city. Expect ridership of e-scooters to remain strong in Charlotte. With that presumed success, Charlotte’s City Council is likely to expand the number of scooters. The two scooter companies are currently limited to 300 scooters each during what the city is calling the “Shared Mobility Pilot Program,” which is expected to last through October. Charlotte will then have the option of allowing more scooters from Lime and Bird, or the City Council could opt to contract with a company for a Charlotte-branded scooter program.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/135312/scooters-are-off-to-a-blazing-start-in-charlotte-20000-people-took-total-of-66220-trips-in-first-month/

Everything you need to know about Charlotte’s dockless scooters and bikes,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,8,1,"Everything you need to know about Charlotte’s dockless scooters and bikes. There has been a surge in dockless scooter and bike brands arriving in Charlotte this year, particularly in the South End, Dilworth and Uptown neighborhoods. Here’s what we learned about the bike and scooter brands that are taking over Charlotte’s sidewalks (and streets): Bikes Spin: Price: $1 to ride for 30 minutes and under, must load $5 to account to start; $14 monthly membership for unlimited 30-minute rides. Accessibility: This was the most common bike we encountered. Mobike: Price: $1 for 30 minutes and under, must add $5 to account to start. Accessibility: Compared to the other apps, the number of bikes displayed on the Mobike app was relatively low. We didn’t see anyone riding any in the city. LimeBike: Price: $1 for 30 minutes, must load $10 to your account to start Accessibility: Out of all the bikes, the LimeBike was the least common one that we encountered, although the map of bikes locations in the app was full. Maybe they were all in use? B-cycle: While not in the dockless category, we can’t leave out Charlotte’s original bike-share. Price: $8 24-hour pass with unlimited two-hour rides (as long as bike is docked), and $4 for each additional 120 minutes Accessibility: B-cycle bikes can be found on 28 docking racks located around the city and must be returned to the rack to end the ride. All the racks we encountered were mostly full. Scooters Bird: Price: $1 to get started, then $0.15 per minute. Max speed: 15 mph Accessibility: By far the most accessible scooter. We saw no fewer than 10 people zooming around on these scooters. Lime: Price: $1 to unlock, $0.15 per minute to ride, must load $10 to account to start (this factors into your LimeBike account as well) Max speed: 14.8 mph Accessibility: Fairly accessible, but Bird seems to have taken over the whole city. Spin: Spin service was reportedly scheduled to begin in conjunction with Bird service in May. But … we haven’t seen any. Price: Couldn’t tell you Max speed: 15 mph according to legend (and Google), 0 mph for us Accessibility: Not accessible",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/living-here-guide/article215699135.html
"Someone’s eventually going to get killed on a scooter, but that won’t mean they’re unsafe",Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,8,14,"Someone’s eventually going to get killed on a scooter, but that won’t mean they’re unsafe. Last Friday night after stumbling out of Howl at the Moon, I started looking around for an electric scooter. I wanted to get out of Uptown so I wouldn’t have to wait as long for a Lyft. I found two scooters, but something about how hard it was for me to scan the QR code and how many buzzed drivers were probably on the road made me reconsider. I’d never thought about it, but I guess scooting while intoxicated is probably illegal and definitely unwise. I walked away, but it only took a few moments for a tipsy couple to grab them, scan them, and barely keep themselves upright as they scooted into the night. That’s when it hit me. Someone’s definitely going to get killed on one of these scooters eventually. And when it happens, we shouldn’t blame the scooter. I don’t want to sound insensitive. I mean, it’s going to be super sad when it finally happens, but it won’t be the fault of Lime and Bird, the two electric scooter companies active in Charlotte. Still, whenever the argument is inevitably made that the scooters themselves are unsafe, we’re going to be in for a goofy city-wide discussion on whether to seriously curtail the scooter craze. You can already see the beginnings of this debate on social media. People complain about how fast the scooters are, how no one wears a helmet, how the riders weave on and off sidewalks and bike lanes, how kids way too young to make split-second traffic decisions are now sharing road space with SUVs. The complaints aren’t even wrong. We all have the anecdotal evidence to back it up. When you add alcohol to the mix, we have to admit someone’s eventually going to get hurt, and bad. Cities who’ve had scooters longer already have plenty of horror stories. Charlotte isn’t far off from getting a bunch of our own. At some point, a reckless scooter, a careless driver, or some combination of the two will lead to a tragic morning news story. And the opportunistic party poopers will be celebrating. “See? I told you!” they’ll say. “Scooters aren’t safe! We need to get rid of them!” We could go the way of cities like Milwaukee and Charleston, both of which recently removed electric scooters from their streets. This kind of knee-jerk reaction is akin to Tide making their bags nearly impossible to open just because some Gen Z kiddos thought it’d be funny to eat them. Electric scooters are dangerous in the same way Tide Pods are dangerous. Yeah, both could accidentally kill you, but personal responsibility and poor decision making is always going to be the X factor. Look, just because something bad can happen to you on a scooter, doesn’t mean the scooter is to blame. A scooter is a tool. It’s just like a car or a bike. Do we debate banning bikes and cars every time a fatality occurs? Bird and Lime, the companies who brought electric scooters to Charlotte, have done plenty to make the scooters safe. Both apps include instructions reminding riders to stay in bike lanes, yield to pedestrians, park the scooters on curbsides, and always ride with a helmet. Lime will even send you a helmet for $10 and Bird will send you one for free. Both companies require you to be 18 to ride, and since scooters are likely considered mopeds under North Carolina law, operating them under the influence of alcohol is a punishable misdemeanor. If you follow those simple rules, scooters are perfectly safe, but no one can force you to make responsible decisions. We all see scooters in streets and on sidewalks all the time. We see them speed past pedestrians with no regard. I’ve never spotted one person wearing a helmet on a scooter, and kids and teens ride them just as much as adults. And with the amount of scooters parked outside of breweries, I’m sure not everyone using them is stone cold sober. What else could Bird, Lime, and Charlotte possibly do? The scooter companies and the city have given us every opportunity to not make boneheaded decisions. What happens after we choose to get on one is up to each one of us.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/136683/scooter-safety-charlotte-bird-and-lime/
"After Seeing Scooter 'Stupidity,' Egleston Calls For Rules",WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2018,8,28,"After Seeing Scooter 'Stupidity,' Egleston Calls For Rules. A pilot program allowing electric scooters on Charlotte streets is continuing through October, when city officials say they'll evaluate how it's working. On Monday, city council member Larken Egleston warned that some users are behaving dangerously and said he doesn't think the city should wait to talk about new rules. Egleston said he's speaking out because he saw people riding scooters the other day on the Interstate 277 loop near uptown. ""Someone will die on an e-scooter before the end of this calendar year,"" he said at the end of the council's dinner meeting Monday. ""We can't completely prevent stupidity. But I saw something Friday I don't think I even imagined, which was two people riding scooters on 277."" ""I wish that was a joke,"" he added. ""I'm dead serious, and they obviously weren't wearing helmets. No one's wearing helmets on these. Someone's going to die on one."" The city said for now, electric scooters — or e-scooters — can be ridden on sidewalks, except in congested business districts, and on streets elsewhere. Riders are supposed to follow traffic laws and, the city said, are encouraged to wear helmets. All that could change at the end of the pilot program. Safety is becoming an issue as more Charlotteans use scooters. After just two months, they're now more popular than dockless bikes, which are also part of the city's ""Shared Mobility"" pilot program. In July, people took more than 100,000 scooter trips, averaging about 1.4 miles per trip, according to the Charlotte Department of Transportation. At the same time, there were only about 27,000 bicycle trips, averaging three-quarters of a mile per trip. ""We've got to be ready, if not before the end of the pilot program, at the end of the program,"" Egleston said. ""We need to have something that we can put in place quickly to say these are the rules that people are going to operate under."" Egleston said he wonders if the city can require helmets, when it will begin enforcing the ban on riding scooters on sidewalks, and whether the should outlaw scooters on roads with speed limits over 35 miles per hour. In Charlotte, two companies currently offer the scooters, which are unlocked by payments made through smartphone apps. Users can find and leave them in public areas along city streets. Egleston said he supports scooter and bike sharing, but he'd like to see some rules enacted as soon as possible. The council is expected to get a briefing as the bike and scooter pilots end.",https://www.wfae.org/post/after-seeing-scooter-stupidity-egleston-calls-rules

But the latest numbers from the pilot program show electric scooter use has quickly outpaced shared bikes, with scooter users riding more and riding farther. Their soaring popularity has also prompted more calls for regulation and worries about safety, helmet-less riders and pedestrians being bowled over. At least one major employer, Duke Energy, has barred its employees from using scooters during work hours. “Even though these items can be tempting to use as a fun, fast means of getting from one location to another, there is also a tremendous amount of risk associated with operating them,” said Duke Energy spokesman Neil Nissan. “Whether they’re walking, riding a bike or driving a car, we’ve asked them to be on the lookout for more people using rental bicycles and scooters.” A Charlotte Department of Transportation spokeswoman declined to comment about safety issues and referred comment to the companies. The CDOT representative said no information was available about injuries reported so far from scooter use, though the department encourages riders to wear helmets and carefully plan their routes. “As more and more people rely on and adapt to scooter sharing, we believe that along with proactive education, safe riding and responsible use will ultimately become a natural habit,” said Mary Caroline Pruitt, a spokeswoman for Lime. She pointed out that the company instructs riders to wear helmets with notices through the app and reminders on the scooter itself. “Safety is our number one priority, and Lime urges riders to always put the safety of others and themselves before anything else when operating any of our vehicles.” Both the bikes and scooters are operating as part of a pilot program under an agreement with the city that ends this fall. Last November, 2,000 dockless bikes from four companies — Ofo, Lime, Mobike and Spin — hit the Charlotte streets. One of the companies, Ofo, pulled out of Charlotte in July and several other U.S. cities this year after the company said it had “begun to re-evaluate markets that present obstacles,” without citing specific reasons. The scooter companies, Bird and Lime, are each allowed to operate up to 400 scooters in Charlotte, under a pilot program that started in late May. In just a few months, the number of scooter rides has outpaced the number of bike rides. While bikes require pedaling, balancing and, in the summer, sweating, electric scooters propel riders at faster speeds with the flick of a thumb lever. As of July, people in Charlotte had ridden electric scooters more than 174,000 times, according to the Charlotte Department of Transportation, compared to approximately 173,264 dockless bike rides. That’s despite the bikes having been available in Charlotte for nine months versus less than three for the scooters and there being almost twice as many bikes available. The data for July, the most recent month available, show bike users took 27,453 trips and rode 19,430 miles. Electric scooters, on the other hand, accounted for 100,273 trips and a whopping 139,215 miles in the same month. The average scooter user rode 1.42 miles and spent 13 minutes per ride, according to CDOT. Bikes were ridden an average of about 3/4 miles, with average trip lengths of nine minutes. Unlike previous bike-sharing options, users leave dockless bikes and scooters wherever they want when their ride is done, and the next user finds their ride with a GPS-enabled app. Riders rent them with an app on their phone. The bikes and scooters typically cost $1 to unlock, and additional charges are based on the time rented, with scooters costing 15 cents per minute and the bikes costing $1 per hour or 30 minutes. After the pilot program ends, Charlotte City Council could consider regulations ranging from banning the companies, requiring them to pay permitting fees, limiting the number of operators allowed in the city or restricting where riders can go. Despite their popularity, the companies have faced questions about regulation and safety. Riders often don’t wear helmets and are sometimes on sidewalks or in traffic. The electric scooters can top 20 mph going downhill. Bicycles are sometimes left blocking sidewalks, in private yards or even dumped in creeks and ponds. The scooter companies prompted even more regulatory questions when they started leaving their dockless electric vehicles around the city without permission. Initially, Charlotte officials told them they had to remove their scooters or face confiscation. But the city agreed in the pilot program to see how they would work. Council member Larken Egleston said Monday that he’s worried about safety. He said he saw a couple riding an electric scooter on Interstate 277 this weekend. “Someone will die on an e-scooter before the end of this calendar year,” he predicted. “We’ve got to have some rules in place.” Bird didn’t respond to messages seeking more information Tuesday.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/article217290350.html
"As Injuries Mount, City Discusses Regulating E-Scooters",WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2018,9,26,"As Injuries Mount, City Discusses Regulating E-Scooters. A bad wreck this week is bringing new urgency to discussions about how the city should regulate electric rental scooters, which appeared on city streets in May. Officials say there are trade-offs - between promoting a popular new transportation option and public safety. On Tuesday, a scooter rider collided with a van at Fourth and Brevard Streets near the Transportation Center. City council member Tariq Bokhari witnessed the wreck and narrated a Facebook Live video as emergency crews arrived. Police said the woman was going the wrong way on a one-way street and may have gone through a red light. The woman had serious, but non-life-threatening leg injuries. Bokhari said it was ""disturbing."" “It was a stark moment of realization that people can really get hurt on these things when they when they don't follow the rules,” Bokhari said. But what about those rules? For now, scooters are treated mostly like bicycles. You're not supposed to ride them on sidewalks downtown, though sidewalks are OK elsewhere. Users must obey traffic laws, including signs and signals. And helmets are encouraged, but not required. Riders rent scooters with a smartphone app. They're $1 to unlock and 15 cents a mile to ride. You have to be 18 with a valid driver's license, though you don’t have to show proof to rent one. Beyond that, rules are still evolving - all over the country. That accident downtown came a day after the topic of e-scooter rules came up at the Charlotte City Council's transportation committee. “Here we are in September, where we recognize now is the time to begin to think about … how do we want to regulate these more clearly, with more clarity, as we move to the future,” Charlotte DOT deputy director Dan Gallagher. “But we also have to understand, a lot's happened in a short time in terms of ridership,” he added. He says ridership on e-scooters has grown quickly since May. In August, scooter companies Lime and Bird reported their combined 800 scooters here were ridden more than 140,000 times. That's compared with just 20,000 rides on dockless bikes. Hard numbers on scooter accidents in Charlotte are hard to come by. Neither the city nor the police department have tracked scooter safety, though CMPD says it's now compiling numbers for the city council. Hospitals also aren't keeping track. But Novant Health Medical Director Dr. Charles Bregier said they've definitely seen an increase in scooter-related injuries since May. “I would say in my experience that we're seeing five times as many of these kinds of accidents than we used to before they came on the market,” he said. At least two e-scooter riders have been killed nationwide in recent months - one in Washington, and another in Dallas. Charlotte has been spared any fatalities, but some injuries have been ""significant,"" Bregier said. “Broken noses, facial contusions, broken arms, broken shoulders, broken wrists, ankle sprains, wrist sprains, all kinds of problems,” he said. Scooters are colliding with cars, hitting pedestrians, and they're crashing on curbs and bumpy surfaces. The question for council members is what kinds of rules - if any - to adopt. Bokhari said no rules will keep people from doing stupid things on scooters and he hopes any regulations will not stifle this new business. Council member Braxton Winston says he thinks scooters are a good, cheap option for many people to bridge the last mile to public transportation and get around the city. “I wanna keep my hands off this as much as possible. I don't think we should jump to regulate these things,” Winston said. At Monday's transportation committee meeting, Charlotte DOT's Dan Gallagher said the city needs a legal definition of scooters, clarity on where they can be ridden, and parking rules. City Attorney Bob Hagemann said the city has limited authority to regulate e-scooters. “This is a situation where technology and the market is ahead of the law,” he said. A recent blog post by a lawyer at the University of North Carolina School of Government suggests they should be treated like other road vehicles - and be registered and insured. “Now that's an opinion. That's not a case. It's not conclusive,” Hagemann said. “But it has sparked, in the last three or four days, over the weekend, some conversation in our office, with staff, with other cities, about what to do in response to that blog that was put out by the School of Government."" He says ultimately the General Assembly may need to act to clarify the law. Meanwhile, the scooter companies are talking to the city. “Both Bird and Lime have been involved in meetings with officials from the city and county to hear comments, concerns, plaudits,” said Bradford Johnson, the Charlotte manager for Lime. “You know, everything can be tweaked and improved.” City transportation planners say they hope to present proposed rules to the transportation committee Oct. 22, and put them to a full council vote in November or December.",https://www.wfae.org/post/injuries-mount-city-discusses-regulating-e-scooters
Here’s why this Outer Banks town has banned electric scooters,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,10,4,"Here’s why this Outer Banks town has banned electric scooters. Electric ride-sharing scooters were banned in the Outer Banks town of Nags Head this week. Town officials cited safety concerns and a lack of local oversight by ride-sharing companies that place the scooters in communities, according to a video of Wednesday’s town commissioners meeting that’s on the town’s website and YouTube. Commissioners voted unanimously at the meeting to outlaw the scooters. Among the safety concerns cited by officials at the meeting: No one from the companies is around to make sure riders are old enough to be on the scooters. Scooter provider Bird requires riders to be at least 18, a company spokeswoman told The (Durham) Herald- Sun. Nags Head’s Planning Board last month also said the scooters could be a “hazard on the beach road or bypass” because they reach speeds of 15 mph to 20 mph, The Outer Banks Voice reported. Nags Head Mayor Ben Cahoon said at Wednesday’s meeting that representatives of electric scooter companies never work with local government officials on developing rules and regulations before the companies put the scooters in communities. The companies “seem to be really resistant to the idea of coming to the table first,” Cahoon said, according to the video of the meeting. The scooters have “exploded” in popularity in many cities and towns, The Charlotte Observer previously reported. But Charlotte, for instance, is still months away from finalizing rules governing the scooters, the Observer reported.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article219516190.html
Charlotte leaders worry about e-scooter safety. Here’s why they won’t regulate them.,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,10,22,"Charlotte leaders worry about e-scooter safety. Here’s why they won’t regulate them. Charlotte won’t impose local regulations on the electric scooters that have become ubiquitous in uptown and surrounding neighborhoods, instead waiting for statewide rules that are expected from the legislature. The dockless e-scooters — which users rent by smartphone app and can leave wherever they want when they’re done — will continue to operate on city streets with no changes for now. Staff told the Charlotte City Council’s Transportation & Planning Committee on Monday that pilot rules, which allow 400 e-scooters each from Bird and Lime, will remain in place. The scooters have proliferated in cities across the U.S. over the past year, confounding local officials trying to deal with the influx of silent, electric two-wheelers zipping along sidewalks and side streets at up to 20 mph. “It kind of reminds me of what it must have been like when automobiles started traveling streets,” said Assistant City Manager Danny Pleasant. “It was pretty disruptive. There weren’t any laws to govern car use.” Instead of passing new, local rules about where riders can go, whether they must wear helmets or how fast they can ride, for example, the City Council will see what the General Assembly does. Staff said at least one e-scooter company has already started lobbying legislators. Local officials fear that if Charlotte passes strict rules about scooters, they’ll be overruled by state lawmakers in Raleigh. That’s what happened in 2015, when the city struggled for more than a year over how to regulate new ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft vs. traditional taxi firms. The taxi companies, and some on the City Council, wanted more rules on background checks for drivers, pricing and permitting than Uber and Lyft required. The General Assembly ultimately passed uniform state regulations that allowed Uber and Lyft to operate as they had been, as long as the company conducted its own background checks on drivers and had their cars inspected annually. “We tried to have local legislation and the state said no, we’re going to regulate it,” said Mayor Pro Tem Julie Eiselt. “So it took it completely out of our hands.” Other cities have taken a harder line on e-scooters than Charlotte. This month, Durham enacted rules requiring the companies to pay $1,000 for a permit, $100 per scooter and $50 each time the city has to move a scooter out of the right-of-way. Raleigh is considering rules that would bar scooters from sidewalks and regulate where and how they can be parked. Nag’s Head, in the Outer Banks, banned them outright. Charlotte City Attorney Bob Hagemann cautioned council members against putting in place rules like those enacted in Durham. “We’re just as likely to provoke something negative from the legislature pushing back against that,” he said. “I think the staff’s recommendation is let’s keep on keeping on with what we’ve been doing.” Since the e-scooters debuted on Charlotte streets in May — without the city’s permission, in a move that rankled local leaders — Bird and Lime have become wildly popular. Riders logged more than 140,000 trips on the 800 or so scooters in Charlotte during August. That number dipped slightly in September, to about 120,000 rides, driven in part by Hurricane Florence, which prompted Bird and Lime to take their e-scooters off the streets. They’ve rapidly outpaced shared bikes. The number of shared bike rides dropped to under 20,000 in September, despite almost twice as many shared bikes as e-scooters available on Charlotte streets. Scooters are already defined as “vehicles” under North Carolina law, Hagemann said. That means they must follow the standard rules of the road: Go the right way on streets, obey traffic signs and signals and yield to pedestrians. Also, no drinking and scooting. It’s still unclear whether scooters meet the state’s definition of “motor vehicles,” however. That would require them to be tagged with the Department of Motor Vehicles, and ban them from sidewalks. Hagemann said the legislature could take similar steps to how they treated Segways in the early 2000s, which were specifically exempted from motor vehicle laws in North Carolina to allow them in cities and on sidewalks. Safety campaign The e-scooters cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute to ride. People known as “juicers” pick the scooters up at night, charge their batteries and redistribute them for riders in the morning. Most of the concerns about e-scooters have centered around safety. Riders rarely wear helmets, and pedestrians have complained that they fear being run over by the scooters when they’re on sidewalks. “We hear a lot about not yielding right of way to pedestrians,” said Dan Gallagher, Charlotte Department of Transportation planning manager. But the scooters have plenty of support, as evidenced by their sky-high ridership. Advocates see the scooters as an alternative to cars for many short rides. They’re also viewed as a new tool to encourage transit ridership by helping people who want to take the rail or bus to go the “last mile” from the transit stop to their destination. There haven’t been any fatalities reported in Charlotte as a result of the scooters, but council members are still worried. Council member Larken Egleston said he saw a scooter with two people on it being ridden on Interstate 277, while council member Tariq Bokhari witnessed a wreck uptown in which a woman was seriously injured on a scooter near the Transportation Center. In September, Bokhari said the scooter hit an oncoming vehicle while going the wrong way down a one-way street. He called the crash “one of the most horrific things I’ve ever seen.” But Monday, Bokhari said more safety regulations wouldn’t have stopped that crash. “There was nothing we could have done other than make scooters gone from Charlotte to prevent that,” he said. Gallagher said the city would start a safety campaign to educate riders about the rules and emphasize that they need to be followed. They’ll look to work with Bird and Lime. Council member Braxton Winston said the city needs to go further than looking at a specific business model. He called for the city to plan for a future when electric scooters are much more widespread, with their own lanes and transportation network. “We’ve got to think of a place where everyone will have a scooter, regardless of whether they’re renting or owning,” he said.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article220438930.html
How Charlotte will handle e-scooters moving forward,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2018,11,4,"How Charlotte will handle e-scooters moving forward. Electric scooter ridership continues to be strong in Charlotte. But will they be able to stick around? After a blazing start, the number of people riding Lime and Bird’s scooters has abated a little — but the services remain popular. More than 435,000 trips had been completed between May and September of this year. About 120,000 of those trips came in September, the last month for which data was available. So far, both Lime and Bird had been operating in Charlotte under a pilot program for “shared mobility,” which also includes the dockless bikes. They were approved for 400 scooters apiece. Those pilot program permits expired November 1. So what did the City Council decide to do? Nothing, really. The city of Charlotte has determined that e-scooters and dockless bikes are valuable, according to the Charlotte Department of Transportation. But there is still no concrete plan for moving forward. The issue came up in a City Council committee, and they basically decided to let the state legislature handle regulating electric scooters. City staff said they believe the General Assembly will take up a bill to hammer out guidelines for them in all cities across the state in 2019. In the meantime, Charlotte is working to extend the permits with Bird and Lime through July 31, 2019. How does the state feel about companies like this? This is good news if you’re a scooter fan. The state legislature has generally been in favor of innovative companies like Lime and Bird. The General Assembly created deals with Uber and Lyft that gave them the ability to operate in North Carolina, over the objections of many municipalities that wanted to crack down on them. Same goes for Airbnb. In the past, the General Assembly has passed a law preventing cities from banning Segways. Chances are the legislation that will emerge around electric scooters will be friendly. So the city won’t do anything? Well, not exactly nothing. The city of Charlotte is planning a marketing campaign to promote the rules for using scooters safely. This includes wearing a helmet, obeying traffic laws and riding sober.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/147381/how-charlotte-will-handle-e-scooters-moving-forward/
"Some Lime Scooters May Be Pulled Off Streets, Reports Of Them Breaking In Half",WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2018,11,13,"Some Lime Scooters May Be Pulled Off Streets, Reports Of Them Breaking In Half. Some of Charlotte’s Lime electric scooters might be getting recalled over concerns they may fall apart while people are using them, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper reported Saturday that the company is recalling all of its models worldwide made by Chinese manufacturer Okai. The decision comes several weeks after Lime announced the Okai models may break apart “when subjected to repeated abuse.” Photos of malfunctions posted on social media show the handlebar stem, or tube, of the scooter ripped from its base. According to Gizmodo, the bike and scooter share company said in an emailed statement that it’s “decommissioning all Okai scooters in the global fleet” and will replace them with “newer, more advanced scooters considered best in class for safety.” The company told Gizmodo that it doesn’t “anticipate any real service disruptions.” Lime also has not said which cities the recall affects or how many scooters are being pulled. The company has around 400 scooters in Charlotte. Pulling Okai models off city streets is the latest in a series of Lime scooter mishaps. The company pulled thousands of its scooters off city streets over the summer for fear that some may catch fire. According to a statement given to the Washington Post, the company learned of a battery defect within a small number of scooters that “could result in the battery smoldering or in some cases catching fire.” In that instance, the company recalled about 2,000 scooters, the Post said. The city launched a pilot program to examine electric scooter ridership and popularity in May. The program is now over and the scooters seem to be here to stay, but city officials are pushing for increased safety rules after reports of accidents and misuse. There aren’t hard numbers on scooter accidents within the city, but Novant Health Medical Director Dr. Charles Bregier told WFAE in September that the hospital has seen an increase in scooter-related injuries since the spring. “I would say in my experience that we're seeing five times as many of these kinds of accidents than we used to before they came on the market,” Bregier said. There have been two Lime scooter-related deaths nationwide, one in Dallas and another in Washington. There have not been any scooter-related fatalities in Charlotte, but Bregier called the injuries he’s seen “significant.” “Broken noses, facial contusions, broken arms, broken shoulders, broken wrists, ankle sprains, wrist sprains, all kinds of problems,” he said. On its website, the city has recommended scooter safety suggestions, such as wearing a helmet, obeying traffic laws and riding while sober. But beyond the recommendations, there are no hard rules. And city officials are holding off on drafting new safety rules while state lawmakers consider legislation. State House transportation committee chairman Rep. John Torbett of Gaston County told NC Insider last month that he plans to introduce a bill to address how scooters, and scooter safety, are regulated. In addition to Charlotte, Lime has scooters in three other North Carolina cities: Durham, Greensboro and Raleigh.

Charlotte could see a sharp spike in e-scooters in 2019,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,11,26,"Charlotte could see a sharp spike in e-scooters in 2019. Charlotte could soon see more of the e-scooters that have quickly become ubiquitous on city streets, as the City Council is considering rules that could allow a sharp increase in the personal electric vehicles’ numbers. The move comes as other cities around North Carolina are taking more steps to curb, tax or even forbid e-scooters from new companies like Lime and Bird that have exploded in popularity nationwide in less than a year. Last month, Charlotteans took e-scooters for about 120,000 rides — an average of nearly 3,900 per day. “I’m a big fan. I use them even in heels and a dress,” said Mayor Pro Tem Julie Eiselt at the City Council Transportation & Planning Committee meeting Monday. Users have racked up more than 1.5 million miles on e-scooters in Charlotte since May. Lime and Bird, the two companies providing rent-by-smartphone e-scooters in Charlotte, are still operating under the terms of a pilot program that started in May. In Charlotte, they’re each allowed up to 400 scooters, which users find via GPS on their phones and rent through an app for $1 to start and 15 cents per mile. “Juicers” drive around and pick the scooters up to recharge their batteries and redeploy them around the city each night. The new rules City Council is set to consider could create “scooter corrals” for parking the electric rides in high-use areas, such as uptown, and could also define areas where riders aren’t allowed on the sidewalks. And the rules could include much higher caps on the number of e-scooters allowed. One option would be to eliminate the caps entirely and let the companies decide how many e-scooters to provide. Council member Tariq Bokhari said he favors a “dynamic cap,” which would allow the companies to provide as many e-scooters as they want, provided they hit a minimum demand threshold to avoid swamping the cities with unused vehicles. “I’m a strong advocate of this dynamic cap principle,” said Bokhari. “Have as many scooters as you want, as long as you’re averaging three rides per day.” The companies are averaging roughly six rides per day on their e-scooters (they don’t always have the full 400 e-scooters they’re allowed on the streets every day). A standard of at least three rides per day would imply about 1,300 e-scooters could be on the streets right now, a number that would rise if demand rose further. That would be a nearly 63 percent increase over the 800 e-scooters allowed under the current cap. Such a system could avoid the glut of dockless bikes that briefly flooded Charlotte streets. Mobike and Ofo, two of the four companies that put out dockless bikes (which users also find via GPS and rent through apps on their phone) have now quit the Charlotte market. In Raleigh, leaders recently approved new rules that will limit the number of e-scooters to 500 per company starting in December. That would cut the number of e-scooters allowed from about 1,400 to 1,000. Raleigh is also charging the companies $300 per e-scooter, while Durham is charging the companies $100 per e-scooter. There’s no such fee in Charlotte. Meanwhile, Winston-Salem leaders voted last week to ban e-scooters, at least until regulations can be finalized. Crews confiscated the vehicles from city sidewalks, according to news reports. Charlotte City Council has been reluctant to consider stringent regulations for e-scooters because the General Assembly could block such rules. The city has been burned by such measures several times in recent years, including when the City Council tried to establish local rules for licensing Uber and Lyft and in the aftermath of a local nondiscrimination ordinance for LGBTQ people, which the state overturned. But some council members said Monday that the city needs to find some way to tax the companies, which use taxpayer-funded infrastructure. “This isn’t something we should roll over and play dead on,” said Eiselt. “These are our streets and we pay a lot of money to maintain them.” Another unresolved issue: Safety regulations. The e-scooters can generally go 20 mph (or faster downhill), and riders zip silently along sidewalks and sometimes weave through traffic in congested areas like uptown. Although no one has been killed riding an e-scooter in Charlotte, such deaths have occurred in other cities, including Washington, D.C. The city started a public safety campaign in November, with Bird and Lime giving away helmets to riders and encouraging them to ride carefully and obey traffic regulations. “I don’t think that message is getting through, perhaps because there’s no enforcement,” said Eiselt. Council member Larken Egleston pointed out that the only Charlotte riders wearing helmets are generally in city-sponsored public service announcements about safety. “I’ve only ever seen one person with one on,” said Egleston.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article222188260.html
Another company is joining the crowded electric scooter scene in Charlotte,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2018,12,10,"Another company is joining the crowded electric scooter scene in Charlotte. Another company is joining Charlotte’s electric scooter craze. You may remember the company Spin as a wave of hundreds of dockless bikes appeared on Charlotte streets in November 2017. Spin, with its orange GPS-enabled bicycles, started with about 500 bikes in Charlotte, but as of this week, the company’s now operating only electric scooters here. Spin spokeswoman Ariella Steinhorn said the company noticed the heightened demand for scooters and is “focusing exclusively” on the popular new vehicles. Spin discontinued its dockless bike program in Charlotte last month. The numbers bear out the scooter trend Spin mentioned: Last month, Charlotteans took e-scooters for about 120,000 rides, which is an average of nearly 3,900 per day, according to a report from the city. Steinhorn said that Spin, which was bought by Ford last month, is starting with 100 scooters in Charlotte. Spin is deploying the electric vehicles locally on Tuesday morning. In recent months, Charlotte City Council has spent hours debating how to regulate electric scooters, which debuted in the city in May without the permission or prior knowledge of City Council. Now, the city’s pilot rules allow 400 e-scooters each from two other existing companies, Bird and Lime. Steinhorn said that Spin has the permits required from the city to deploy its scooters in Charlotte, and that it worked with the city to help determine placements of its e-scooters. Initially they’re just in uptown and South End, but locations could extend depending on demand, she added. “The goal is to ensure minimal disruption to cities while opening up access to a sustainable last-mile transportation option,” Steinhorn said. City Council, hesitant to consider stringent regulations for e-scooters, is considering additional rules that would allow for even more e-scooters in 2019. For instance, one proposed rule would be to eliminate the e-scooter caps entirely and let companies decide how many of the electric vehicles to provide. Spin e-scooters cost $1 to unlock, and 15 cents for every additional minute. After adding their payment information on the Spin app, riders can scan the QR code to unlock the scooter before they begin their ride. On the app, riders can also rate how they found the scooter parked (thumbs up or thumbs down.) Though dockless bikes have been in Charlotte longer than scooters, scooters months ago overtook bikes as the preferred non-automobile ride-share of choice. By July, Charlotte commuters had ridden e-scooters more than 174,000 times, according to the Charlotte Department of Transportation, compared with roughly 173,264 dockless bike rides. That’s despite the fact that bikes were available for nine months in Charlotte, versus less than three for the scooters. There also were almost twice as many bikes available at the time.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article222598650.html

Charlotte may allow more e-scooters but with tighter rules on riding them,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2019,1,7,"Charlotte may allow more e-scooters but with tighter rules on riding them. Charlotte is planning to allow more electric scooters on city streets, while also adding rules to cap speeds, ban sidewalk riding from a big chunk of uptown and charge scooter rental companies a new fee. The rules are part of the city’s attempts to cope with the rapid influx of scooters that have proven wildly popular but also raised safety concerns as they zip around at 20 mph, weaving between pedestrians or darting into traffic. An emerging technology, the GPS-enabled, rent-by-app scooters have outpaced regulations designed mostly for cars, bicycles and pedestrians. “When we were sitting around the table last year, these didn’t even exist,” said council member Braxton Winston, who said the scooters are a “desperately needed” transportation option. The proposed rules, which the City Council could vote on as soon as next week, would cap scooter speeds at 15 mph, ban riding in streets where the speed limit is over 35 mph, require scooter companies to put 20 percent of their vehicles in low-income neighborhoods every day and institute a “dynamic” fee charged to the scooter companies. That fee hasn’t been set, but it could vary based on factors such as whether scooters are parked correctly, to encourage the companies to act responsibly. Scooter companies are currently capped at a maximum of 400 vehicles in Charlotte. The new rules would allow scooter companies to add vehicles, 50 at a time, if they can show their scooter fleet is averaging more than three rides per scooter, per day over a 30-day period. They would have to take vehicles off the roads if their average use fell below two rides per scooter, per day. One of the most significant changes in a new scooter ordinance would bar riders from the sidewalk — but only in certain parts of the city. “We’re proposing to identify an area inside center city that will not allow riding on sidewalks,” said Dan Gallagher, deputy director of the Charlotte Department of Transportation. The area where scooters wouldn’t be allowed on the sidewalk would include the blocks bounded by Stonewall, Seventh, College and Church streets. Council members said more clarity is needed for the rules around scooters, but questioned specific parts of the proposal. Some wanted more information about the dynamic pricing scheme, while others said they were uncomfortable with parts of the ordinance such as the 15 mph speed cap or the low-income neighborhood distribution requirement. Questions over uptown restrictions Council member LaWana Mayfield questioned whether it makes sense to bar scooters from sidewalks uptown, which are often wider and usually well-maintained, and allow them in neighborhoods outside the city’s core where sidewalks are often narrower and interrupted by obstructions like power poles. “Saying we’re only going to focus on safety in uptown, that’s a challenge,” said Mayfield. She also said more specific rules for riders could be needed. “Saying we hope (riders) are going to make the best decision doesn’t really work.” She called the staff presentation “heavily pro-scooter” and questioned why more information about cities that have chosen to ban scooters wasn’t included. “We don’t have any reason to believe there’s something coming,” said council member Larken Egleston. Gallagher said it would be easier to charge a per-scooter fee, but that “may not address some of the behavioral issues out there.” Meanwhile, in Raleigh, Bird is adding a $2 per-ride charge for scooter users, raising the cost of unlocking the scooters to $3 each ride. That’s in response to a $300 annual fee Raleigh City Council decided to impose on the companies for each scooter. Bird called the fee “unreasonable,” and prompted riders to email City Council and Raleigh’s mayor in protest. Charlotte is unique among large North Carolina cities in charging the companies nothing, however. Greensboro charges the companies $50 per scooter, while Durham charges $100. Other North Carolina cities, including Winston-Salem and Asheville, have banned the scooters from their streets, at least until regulations are sorted out. Growing popularity Bird and Lime both field about 400 scooters on city streets, the current limit, while Spin, the newest entrant, has about 100. The scooter companies are operating under a pilot program the city started in May, after Lime unexpectedly dropped its scooters off on Charlotte streets and then urged riders to email City Council when leaders complained and said they might order the scooters banned. Charlotte officials expect state lawmakers to pass rules governing exactly what cities can and can’t require scooter operators to do. Draft rules proposed last month would have exempted scooters from motor vehicle registration requirements, which experts say they could be subject to under current laws, but left cities largely free to set local regulations. The legislature didn’t pass those rules, however. Though they’re newer than dockless bicycles, scooters have quickly become much more popular. Ofo, Mobike and Spin, three of the four dockless bike-share companies in Charlotte last year, have pulled their bikes off the city streets. Monthly ridership numbers show why: In November, dockless bikes accounted for just 3,312 trips covering 2,213 miles in Charlotte, while scooters racked up for 83,415 trips covering 98,004 miles. The highest month of ridership, August, saw about 140,000 rides in Charlotte. “That’s pretty amazing ridership,” said Gallagher. “We might be able to peel some automobile trips off the road.” However fast the city moves, the companies could move faster as the marketplace continues to change rapidly. Last week, Lime rolled out for the first time in Charlotte dockless electric bikes, which use motors to help riders pedal more easily, especially uphill. How e-scooters work Riders find scooters, which are tracked by GPS, using their smart phones. They pay $1 to unlock the scooter, and 15 cents per minute they ride. Riders leave the scooter wherever they want once the ride is finished. In the evening, contract workers for each company, called “juicers,” collect the scooters, recharge them, and redistribute them across the city before morning.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article224020365.html

"Council OKs Rules For E-Scooters, But Revisions Likely",WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2019,1,15,"Council OKs Rules For E-Scooters, But Revisions Likely. Charlotte City Council members approved new rules for electric scooters Monday, but only after a long debate that several members say shows a need to revisit the rules later. The new rules have been months in the making. They're the council's first attempt to address the safety of electric scooters, which have been on city streets only since May. Among other things, the ordinance caps scooter speeds at 15 miles an hour, prohibits more than one person on a scooter and bans them from sidewalks in the central part of uptown. Mayor Pro-Tem Julie Eiselt, who chairs the council's transportation committee, said Charlotte is helping to chart new ground for local regulation nationally. ""We've had a lot of conversations around scooters over the past few months, a new technology that's been very disruptive but very popular,"" she said. So popular that users took more than 100,000 scooter trips a month in Charlotte this fall. But safety has been an issue. Some city council members have cited scooter wrecks and injuries as an argument for safety rules. And some residents have complained about scooters taking over city sidewalks. The vote was 7-3, with council members Braxton Winston, LaWana Mayfield and Matt Newton opposed. Winston, a supporter of scooters, thinks the 15 mile an hour speed limit - alongside faster moving traffic - is too low and possibly unsafe. ""This is the first round of this technology, and by putting this cap, we actually are regulating the potential of creating a safer, more durable product,"" Winston said. Two items discussed previously were not in the version approved last night: banning scooters from streets with speed limits over 35 miles per hour and a requirement that scooter companies put at least 20 percent of their scooters in areas described as ""disadvantaged "" Three companies - Lime, Bird and Spin - now operate scooters here. Riders pay using a mobile phone app. City officials have promoted scooters as an option for what they call ""the last mile"" to and from public transportation. City council member Greg Phipps said before the vote he's sure the city will have to revisit the rules as the technology evolves, and if the General Assembly decides to adopt a statewide scooter law. A statement from scooter company Lime welcomed the new rules: “We are pleased with a number of provisions included in tonight’s ordinance that passed Charlotte City Council, and we are proud to provide affordable, accessible transportation to people across the city. We are continuing to review and evaluate certain provisions and will provide additional comment as we are able.",https://www.wfae.org/post/council-oks-rules-e-scooters-revisions-likely
North Carolina Scooters Get First Regulation In House Bill,WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2019,2,26,"North Carolina Scooters Get First Regulation In House Bill. North Carolina legislators have taken a small first step toward regulating electric scooters as Charlotte and other cities wrestle with managing scooters and the companies that offer them to the public. A House transportation panel voted Tuesday to define ""electric stand up scooters"" in state law, and make clear they're exempt from registration requirements for mopeds and other vehicles. The bill's initial version contained more regulations directing how and where scooters can be ridden and parked, and made clear municipal governments can prohibit use on sidewalks and license scooter companies. Bill sponsor Rep. John Torbett said the proposal wouldn't affect scooter operations in general if it became law. More comprehensive rules could be considered at a later date. In January, Charlotte City Council approved initial rules in an effort to regulate scooters. The new ordinance caps scooter speeds at 15 miles an hour, prohibits more than one person on a scooter and bans them from sidewalks in the central part of uptown.

City Will Test Financial Incentives For Scooter Parking And Safety,WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2019,3,20,"City Will Test Financial Incentives For Scooter Parking And Safety. It has been 10 months since electric scooters appeared on Charlotte streets. Since then, city officials have been trying to figure out how to manage things like parking and safety. This week, the city began a six-month pilot project using small electronic payments that it hopes will help. Charlotte is one of three cities — along with Detroit and Omaha — working with the Charlotte-based mobile payment company Passport. The plan is to test whether small fees can be used to incentivize good parking and safety behavior. Scooter-by-scooter data gathered wirelessly by Passport will allow the city to adjust fees, said Dan Gallagher, who oversees scooters for Charlotte Department of Transportation. “If a scooter rider is doing all the right things, the fee that would ultimately be charged would be heavily discounted,"" he said. ""If a scooter rider is doing all the wrong the things, the scooter fee that would be charged to the vendor would be increased."" Gallagher said the city's goal isn't to generate revenue, but to encourage good behavior. Rising or falling fees could be used to make sure parked scooters are not blocking sidewalks, to get users to wear helmets or to ensure they follow traffic rules. Passport also can track whether companies are putting scooters beyond uptown, especially near bus and rail stations. Gallagher said the city might decide to let companies park scooters free in those areas, while charging a fee in others. Three scooter companies — Lime, Bird and Spin — are currently permitted for up to 400 scooters each in Charlotte. Until now, the city hasn't charged any fees. In some other cities, companies pay hundreds of dollars a year per scooter — arbitrary numbers that local officials seemingly pulled out of a hat, said Evan Costagliola, the head of transportation partnerships at Lime, which is part of the pilot. “We think this is a way to eliminate unsustainable fees and policies that are established in the absence of data,"" he said. ""This is something we think is going to be a model nationally."" Costagliola said he hopes the hard data on ridership also will push cities to eliminate caps on the number of scooters. ""Most likely 400 (scooters) is not enough,"" he said. ""To me, the caps are artificially suppressing demand. This will be trying, through data, to optimize the fleet size."" MONTHLY CHARGES Scooter companies would get a monthly bill based on how well their scooters meet the city's criteria. Whether they pass fees on to riders depends on how high they are, Costagliola said. ""We don't do that now but if fees are exorbitantly high, we would consider it,"" he said. The pilot is just beginning, so no rules or fees have been set. The three cities, Lime and Passport will be trying to figure all that out, said Kate Wagoner, the Director of Urban Mobility at Passport. ""It really gives us an opportunity to experiment and iterate with different pricing models,"" Wagner said. ""So the pricing is really going to be driven by the city and it depends on the city's goals."" Passport brings lots of experience to the test. The company pitched scooters, in part, as a parking problem – something it knows well. It built its business originally on mobile parking payments. Passport now has about 600 clients worldwide, including the City of Charlotte. It's behind the CATS Pass mobile payment app used on the Lynx Blue Line light rail. The city hopes all the new data will help as it develops new rules and policies. In January, the Charlotte City council adopted its first definition of scooters, set a maximum speed of 15 miles an hour and banned them from sidewalks uptown.",https://www.wfae.org/post/city-will-test-financial-incentives-scooter-parking-and-safety
Charlotte to roll out new 'dynamic pricing' plan for e-scooter companies,WSOCTV,ABC,"Charlotte, NC",2019,3,26,"Charlotte to roll out new 'dynamic pricing' plan for e-scooter companies. Next month, Charlotte plans to start testing new dynamic pricing for electric scooter companies across the city. City Council received an update on the plan during Monday night’s meeting. The idea impacts how much the city charges companies like Lime and Bird for every e-scooter in the city. Under dynamic pricing, the city could charge companies more or less per scooter, based on whether riders are following safety rules like wearing helmets and whether the scooters are parked safely. The city doesn't charge scooter companies like Lime and Bird a fee to operate, but other cities across the state, like Raleigh and Greensboro, charge them a fee per scooter or per year up to $500. But those cities don't reward the companies if their riders follow all the rules. That's something Charlotte wants to do. Starting in April and continuing for the next three months, the city plans to test out the pilot system to see how successful it is and to determine a permanent pricing plan. [Councilman worried about dockless scooter safety: 'Someone will die'] The proposed plan is the next step in a series of changes city leaders have made since the scooters came to Charlotte. In January, new rules went into place for how the scooters could be ridden, capping the speeds to 15 mph, banning two people from riding one scooter and prohibiting scooters from riding on certain busy sidewalks in uptown.",https://gcn.com/articles/2020/02/13/charlotte-micromobility-data-pilot.aspx
"Scoot responsibly? You could pay less. But if you don’t, scooter costs could rise",Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2019,3,26,"Scoot responsibly? You could pay less. But if you don’t, scooter costs could rise. Charlotte is preparing to charge the companies behind the suddenly ubiquitous electric scooters zipping around the city a fee for the first time — but that fee will vary based on how riders use the scooters. Instead of charging a fixed, annual fee per scooter like most other cities have chosen to do, Charlotte will use “dynamic pricing” to charge the companies variable monthly fees to encourage what the city terms “good behavior.” The companies will receive deductions if users do things like park scooters without blocking the sidewalk, wear helmets and park near transit stops or in other high-use areas. They’ll be charged more if users do things like block sidewalks or park their scooters in a low-usage area where it sits idle for hours. “No cities were encouraging, through their fee programs, good behavior,” said Dan Gallagher, deputy director of the Charlotte Department of Transportation, at the City Council meeting Monday. He said that if everyone follows the “good behavior” guidelines, the city might not collect any revenue from the companies, even as Charlotte closes in on a million scooter rides since they debuted in May. “If every single one of those million trips did exactly that, we might collect no fees for scooters,” said Gallagher. The city has partnered with Charlotte-based Passport to pilot the dynamic pricing program, and will spend the next few months collecting data and testing the system. There are three companies with e-scooters on the street in Charlotte: Bird, Lime and Spin. Users locate and rent the scooters — which are tracked by GPS — via smartphone app. The scooters typically cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute to ride. At the end of the day, “juicers” pick up the scooters, recharge their batteries, and redistribute them throughout the city. The exact amount Charlotte will charge each company under the dynamic pricing scheme hasn’t been worked out, Gallagher said. City Council members praised the idea as flexible and innovative. “A lot of big tech cities have gotten this wrong,” said council member Tariq Bokhari. Council member Justin Harlow asked how the city would monitor and enforce the pricing structure over tens of thousands of rides each month, and whether it would be “kind of like the honor system.” Gallagher said the the scooter companies, Charlotte and Passport will develop ways to tell if the “good behavior” rules are being followed. For example, the companies already track location via GPS, so they can see how long and where a scooter is parked. A picture of the parked scooter, uploaded by the user, can verify it’s not blocking the sidewalk. And a selfie can show if someone is wearing a helmet. Harlow also asked if the companies might charge more if user behavior causes their fees to rise. “Do we have any fear these companies will pass the cost on to riders?” he asked. Gallager said that’s possible — but so is the inverse. “We’re working in a free market system here,” he said. “There may be no costs to pass on if everyone’s doing the right thing.” E-scooters have quickly supplanted shared bikes in popularity, with more than 850,000 rides logged. But while City Council has instituted some basic rules about how many scooters the companies can put out on city streets each day and what their maximum speed can be, the city hasn’t set any rules about charging companies to operate and use the public right-of-way on sidewalks for parking. Most other large cities in North Carolina charge the scooter companies some kind of annual fee, though they vary widely. Greensboro charges $50 per scooter, while Durham charges $100. In Raleigh, the highest, scooter companies have been fighting a $300 annual per-scooter fee by charging riders a $2 per trip surcharge. City Council approved new rules for people riding scooters in January. Those rules capped scooter speeds at 15 mph, banned scooters from sidewalks in the densest part of uptown (an area bounded by Stonewall, Seventh, College and Church streets), and lifted Charlotte’s 400 scooters per-company cap. The companies can now add scooters 50 at a time to their fleets, after they demonstrate their scooters are being ridden an average of at least three times a day for 30 days.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article228392044.html
Lime Phases Out Bicycles As Scooters Win Charlotte Streets,WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2019,4,18,"Lime Phases Out Bicycles As Scooters Win Charlotte Streets. It looks like electric scooters have beaten out dockless bicycles in the race for users on Charlotte's streets. Lime said Thursday it has phased out its green rental bicycles in Charlotte over the past several weeks to focus on scooters. Lime came to Charlotte in November 2017 and had competed with Ofo, Spin and Mobike. As of this week, the San Francisco company was the only bicycle vendor still listed on the City of Charlotte's Shared Mobility Pilot Program website. Ofo pulled out last summer, and a mountain of its yellow bikes were later spotted in a Charlotte scrapyard. Lime said in a statement Thursday users have shown a preference for its electric scooters: “Riders are voting with their feet – they’ve demonstrated a penchant for Lime’s electric-vehicles and shown scooters are no longer a novelty, but rather one more flexible link to the transit chain. We strongly believe the best way for us to maximize the positive impacts of Lime in local communities is to demonstrate our agility and willingness to adjust based on patterns of preference, utilization and needs.” According to Charlotte Department of Transportation statistics, riders took about 800 trips on dockless bikes in December, compared with with 2,800 trips a day on electric scooters. Those are the latest statistics available. Total trips have topped 100,000 some months. Lime says it hasn't gotten out of the bicycle market entirely, though it has pulled bikes out of other cities. It's still operating bikes in some places and still introducing them to new markets. Rental bicycles and scooters have run into some difficulties around the country from local governments trying to regulate the new transportation options. Both Lime and Bird announced last month they'll pull bikes and scooters out of Raleigh. The companies cited ""burdensome"" regulations and high fees. Rules there limit companies to 500 scooters each and charge an annual feet of $300 per scooter. The state House of Representatives also is considering legislation to regulate scooters. Charlotte has taken a more hands-off approach, without fees. New rules for scooters adopted by the city council in January call for studying per-scooter fees that change based on how well the companies and users follow the rules. The city began a pilot program last that would adjust prices based on parking, speed and safety.",https://www.wfae.org/post/lime-phases-out-bicycles-scooters-win-charlotte-streets
"Boom In Electric Scooters Leads To More Injuries, Fatalities",WFAE,NPR,"Charlotte, NC",2019,6,7,"Boom In Electric Scooters Leads To More Injuries, Fatalities. Andrew Hardy was crossing the street on an electric scooter in downtown Los Angeles when a car struck him at 50 miles per hour and flung him 15 feet in the air before he smacked his head on the pavement and fell unconscious. The 26-year-old snapped two bones in each leg, broke a thighbone, shattered a kneecap, punctured a lung and fractured three vertebrae in his neck, in addition to sustaining a head injury. ""My brother thought I was dead,"" said Hardy, who wasn't wearing a helmet. Doctors told Hardy he'd likely be paralyzed for life. Five months later, he has learned to walk again. But he says he'll never ride another scooter. ""These scooters should not be available to the public,"" Hardy said. ""Those things are like a death wish."" As stand-up electric scooters have rolled into more than 100 cities worldwide, many of the people riding them are ending up in the emergency room with serious injuries. Others have been killed. There are no comprehensive statistics available but a rough count by The Associated Press of media reports turned up at least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the U.S. since the beginning of 2018. Nine were on rented scooters and two on ones the victims owned. With summer fast approaching, the numbers will undoubtedly grow as more riders take to the streets. Despite the risks, demand for the two-wheeled scooters continues to soar, popularized by companies like Lime and Bird. In the U.S. alone, riders took 38.5 million trips on rentable scooters in 2018, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Riders adore the free-flying feel of the scooters that have a base the size of a skateboard and can rev up to 15 miles per hour. They're also cheap and convenient, costing about $1 to unlock with a smartphone app and about 15 cents per minute to ride. And in many cities, they can be dropped off just about anywhere after a rider reaches their destination. But pedestrians and motorists scorn the scooters as a nuisance at best and a danger at worst. Cities, meanwhile, can hardly keep up. In many cases, scooter-sharing companies dropped them onto sidewalks overnight without warning. Regulations vary from place to place. In New York and the U.K., electric scooters are illegal on public roads and sidewalks, even though riders routinely flout the law. Last week in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, a rider was struck and killed by a car just one day after scooters were introduced there, leading to immediate calls for a ban. And in Nashville, Tennessee, where another rider was killed, the city's mayor warned scooter operators they had 30 days to clean up their act or he would propose a ban. Fed up with the thousands of scooters flooding Paris streets, Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced new regulations Thursday limiting the number of scooter operators and imposing a 5 mile-per-hour speed limit in areas with heavy foot traffic. The city has already imposed a 135 euro ($150) fine on anyone who rides scooters on sidewalks. Isabelle Albertin, a pianist at Paris' famed Opera Garnier, suffered a double fracture of her right arm after she was run down by an electric scooter on May 17. She is suing the city and has started an organization to push for a ban. ""On the sidewalks of Paris, it's a total madhouse. We pedestrians are totally insecure,"" she told Le Parisien newspaper. Data on injuries or fatalities linked to scooters is hard to come by because the industry is so new. In Austin, Texas, public health officials working with the Centers for Disease Control counted 192 scooter-related injuries in three months in 2018. Nearly half were head injuries, including 15% that were traumatic brain injuries like concussions and bleeding of the brain. Less than 1% of the injured riders wore a helmet. Bird, one of the largest scooter-sharing companies, dropped its scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, California, in September 2017 and within a few months riders were showing up at the emergency room, according to Dr. Tarak Trivedi, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles and co-author of one of the first peer-reviewed studies of scooter injuries. The following year, Trivedi and his colleagues counted 249 scooter injuries, and more than 40% were head injuries. Just 4% were wearing a helmet. ""I don't think our roads are ready for this,"" Trivedi said. Bird and Lime both recommend that riders wear helmets, and they've handed out tens of thousands for free. But last year, Bird successfully fought a California proposal that would have required helmets for adults, maintaining that scooters should follow the same laws as electric bikes that don't require adult helmets. Bird says helmet requirements are off-putting to riders and could lead to fewer scooters on the road. Almost counterintuitively, the company argues that it's better to have more riders than less because it forces drivers to pay attention to them. ""There's a safety in numbers effect, where the motorists know that there's people out on the street, so they act accordingly,"" said Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy for Bird. Getting people to wear helmets is a challenge. Riders don't want exposure to lice or germs that could be found in shared helmets, and many make a spontaneous decision to scoot while they're already out and about. That was the case when Drew Howerton, 19, hopped on a Lime scooter on a whim last October in Austin. He recalls signing a waiver that said he should wear a helmet, but he didn't have one on him. ""I didn't show up in Austin thinking I'm going to ride a scooter today, better bring my helmet,"" Howerton said. Scooter-sharing companies generally restrict riding to those 18 years and up, but some children, or their parents, have found ways around that. A 5-year-old boy died in Oklahoma after he fell from a scooter he was riding on with his mother and was struck by a car. Bird and Lime are taking steps to try to make scooters safer. After observing that scooter-related fatalities often occur after midnight when riders may have been drinking, Bird ceased operations after midnight. Lime halts rentals overnight in some markets but in most its scooters are available all night. Lime has also been updating the design of its scooters, with a broader wheel base and better suspension and braking; Bird is including more durable brakes and reinforced hardware to prevent failures. Both companies have been pushing cities for more bike lanes and better infrastructure as their riders navigate roads and traffic under conditions that were designed for cars and trucks. ""The reality is, cars continue to kill more people annually than any other mode of transportation,"" Lime said in a statement. ""We must address this issue together with cities, get people out of their vehicles, and build cities that put people first, with smarter infrastructure to protect riders."" For Howerton, his first experience with a scooter left him scarred. Even though he read the warning not to ride downhill, he did it anyway since hills are hard to avoid in Austin. When he tried to brake, he flew off the scooter and hit his head on the pavement, blood gushing into his eyes. ""These companies, for the large part, they show up in cities and they just kind of dump these rideshare devices,"" Howerton said. ""They tout them as this really cool, innovative, public transportation thing that's cheap and affordable and yeah it is, but they're dangerous and they don't think about the potential health consequences.""",https://www.wfae.org/post/boom-electric-scooters-leads-more-injuries-fatalities
Should Charlotte consider banning electric scooters?,WCNC,NBC,"Charlotte, NC",2019,6,26,"Should Charlotte consider banning electric scooters? After a deadly accident this month, Nashville's mayor wants to ban the popular scooters. Should Charlotte do the same? If you spend any time around uptown Charlotte, especially on the weekends, then you're familiar with the rentable electric scooters zipping around town. After making a controversial debut over a year ago, the scooters have remained a popular way to get around the Queen City, particularly in uptown and South End. It wasn't long until safety concerns were raised and new regulations were passed. In January, the City Council voted 7-3 in favor of new rules that put a speed cap of 15 mph on the scooters, banned two people riding at the same time and barred them from certain streets in uptown. Charlotte isn't alone when it comes to people worried about scooter safety. The mayor of Nashville, Tennessee is recommending a complete ban on e-scooters after a deadly accident earlier this month.

He reportedly had twice the legal amount of alcohol in his system. “Nashville prides itself in being a friendly and welcoming city for the thousands of tourists visiting us each month, but we must also be a safe city. Based upon what I have witnessed firsthand, the recent influx of scooters in our city is causing us to be less safe and more visually cluttered,” Mayor David Briley wrote to the seven scooter companies operating in the city. Briley said he received proposed changes but they weren't enough to consider keeping the scooters on Nashville streets. Briley said he will work with the Metro Legal Director to draft the amendment that would ""terminate the existing scooter pilot program, immediately remove all electric scooters from Nashville streets, and direct the Transportation Licensing Commission to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) within 90 days of the Council's approval of the ordinance."" Briley said he would consider adding back one or two scooter operators in the future to provide a limited number of scooters that meet requirements ""for safety and accessibility,"" which is the purpose of the RFP.",https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/local/wake-up-charlotte/should-charlotte-consider-banning-electric-scooters/275-ac6271ed-7554-44a6-ba07-e68b3d2c650d

The 16 injuries in Charlotte and 19 in Raleigh were reported in state crash data from January 2018 through May of this year. The numbers underscore anecdotal accounts of near-collisions with cars and pedestrians as the cities struggled to regulate an industry that seemed to appear overnight. No one has died in the 82 total crashes reported in Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem and Greensboro that involved scooters assumed to be rentals, according to the data from the N.C. Division of Motor Vehicles. But nearly half of those crashes resulted in obvious injuries, and state data suggests that scooters crash much more often than do cars and trucks. Charlotte scooter riders have logged nearly 1.4 million miles from May 2018 through this May, the Charlotte Department of Transportation says. (The state crash data reported here is for the period beginning in January 2018, three months before scooters were introduced.) The 39 scooter crashes in Charlotte in that time represent 28 crashes per 1 million miles traveled. The 16 crashes with injuries produce a rate of 11.5 crashes per million miles. Motor vehicles in Mecklenburg County, by comparison, crash only 3.4 times per 1 million miles, according to three-year averages reported in 2017. Crashes with non-fatal injuries occur only 0.9 times per million miles. It was only a little more than a year ago that scooters owned by two companies, Lime and Bird, appeared in Charlotte’s uptown and close-in neighborhoods including South End. Spin has since joined the market. Scooters typically rent for $1 to start through phone apps. The trend was so new that Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police didn’t have codes that isolate accidents involving the vehicles. The whisper-quiet scooters, which hum along at about 15 mph, also faced no enforceable rules on how and where they could be ridden. Most riders in uptown prefer sidewalks and rarely wear helmets, as scooter companies recommend. Within six months of their arrival, Charlotte City Council member Tariq Bokhari witnessed “one of the most horrific things I’ve ever seen” — a scooter headed the wrong way on a one-way uptown street that met an oncoming car. In January, after months of study, city council adopted rules that ban electric scooters from sidewalks in the heart of downtown, although many riders ignore the rule. Council capped scooter speeds at 15 mph, lifted a cap on the number of vehicles participating companies could deploy and allowed the city to start charging fees. The city did not require riders to wear helmets. A bill before North Carolina’s legislature would revise state motor vehicle law by adding electric scooters to a class of vehicles including bicycles and electric-assisted bicycles. Charlotte riders have taken more than 1.2 million trips on e-scooters since May 2018, the Charlotte Department of Transportation says. Statewide crash data shows three collisions — one in Charlotte and two in Raleigh — resulted in “incapacitating” injuries between January 2018 and this May. Another 34 crashes resulted in “evident” injuries, including 15 in Charlotte and 17 in Raleigh, records show. Winston-Salem and Greensboro both had one crash with evident injuries. Charlotte had 18 crashes and Raleigh five in in which reports said injuries were possible. The two cities combined for 17 crashes that did only property damage. Many traffic accidents go unreported, the N.C. Department of Transportation says. The state crash data is limited to moving motor vehicles that are involved in an “unstabilized situation” after a loss of control.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/traffic/article232139702.html
Lime Scooters are now available in Ballantyne. But will they stay?,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2019,7,11,"Lime Scooters are now available in Ballantyne. But will they stay? Lime launched more than 20 electric scooters as part of a pilot program in Ballantyne this week, expanding its popular scooter service beyond the central city for the first time. Although Lime, Bird and Spin scooters are common in uptown and South End, this is the first time electric scooters will be available in Ballantyne, according to the companies. The scooters will be available for 90 days, then the pilot could become a full program depending on how often the scooters have been used, Christina Thigpen, vice president of marketing and communications for Northwood Office, a subsidiary of Ballantyne Corporate Park’s owner, said in a statement. The scooters are allowed — on sidewalks only — around Ballantyne Corporate Park, including on Ballantyne Commons Parkway and Ballantyne Corporate Place. The Golf Club at Ballantyne is off limits. People can ride the Lime scooters for an initial charge of $1 and then 33 cents per minute. Helping sustainability, connectivity The electric scooters will help with sustainability by allowing people to travel around Ballantyne without a car, Thigpen said in her statement. “We’re continuing to focus on convenience, walkability and more amenities that contribute to a better quality of life,” Thigpen said. Russell Murphy, a spokesman for Lime, said the pilot program will connect Ballantyne’s restaurants, shops and offices by giving people another way to travel. What about Bird and Spin? Lime’s program in Ballantyne could open the door for the other two scooter companies in Charlotte, Bird and Spin, to expand there. A Bird spokesperson said the company hopes Charlotte’s suburbs will embrace scooters as a transportation option. “We have been having productive conversations with local leaders, and look forward to continuing to work with the city to build a framework that supports affordable and accessible transportation options,” Bird said in a statement. Maria Buczkowski, a spokeswoman for Spin, said it has no plans for expansion. Safety concerns Lime’s pilot program in Ballantyne comes at a time when electric scooters are coming under closer scrutiny by the Charlotte City Council. Last week the Charlotte Observer reported that nearly three dozen people had been injured by electric scooters in Charlotte and Raleigh since early last year. Sixteen of the injuries were in Charlotte. The city council approved new rules in January that capped scooter speeds at 15 mph, allowed scooter companies to add more than 400 scooters based on ridership numbers and banned the scooters from sidewalk use in a central part of the city.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article232539442.html
Lime says Charlotte e-scooter riders have passed the million-mile mark,Charlotte Observer,,"Charlotte, NC",2019,8,13,"Lime says Charlotte e-scooter riders have passed the million-mile mark. Lime, one of the three companies operating electric scooters in Charlotte, says its riders have crossed the 1 million-mile mark in the city. More than 165,000 riders have used Lime, the company says, with BB&T Ballpark and the Charlotte Rail Trail among the most-visited destinations. Lime says the trips have eliminated 1.5 million pounds of carbon emissions. The Charlotte Department of Transportation reports riders overall have taken 1.5 million e-scooter trips , totaling 1.7 million miles, since scooters were first permitted to operate in May 2018. Scooters owned by Lime and Bird were the first to appear on uptown sidewalks. A third company, Spin, has since joined the market. To mark the million-mile occasion, Lime said it’s offering first-time riders two free ride credits with the promo code FIRSTLIMECLT. Lime Access also offers half-price rides to people who qualify for city, state or federal low-income programs. The new mode of getting around has come with a cost: scooter accidents and resulting injuries occur at higher rates than do motor vehicles as a whole, the Observer reported in July. Nearly three dozen people were injured in electric scooter crashes in Charlotte and Raleigh from January 2018 through May 2019. Sixteen injuries were reported in Charlotte and 19 in Raleigh, according to state crash data. In Charlotte, the 39 total reported scooter crashes in that period represented 28 crashes per 1 million miles traveled. The 16 crashes with injuries produced a rate of 11.5 crashes per million miles. Motor vehicles in Mecklenburg County, by comparison, crash 3.4 times per 1 million miles, according to three-year averages reported in state data in 2017. Crashes with non-fatal injuries occur 0.9 times per million miles. No fatalities were reported in North Carolina scooter crashes, but this month a scooter driver in Durham crashed and was run over by a passing car, leaving the rider with life-threatening injuries, WTVD reported. Lime said Tuesday it’s rolling out a smoother-handling, safer version of its scooters after several weeks of tests in Charlotte. The new Gen3 scooter has a new front-wheel suspension, larger wheels and additional braking, the company said, as well as extended battery capacity and waterproofing of key components.",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/traffic/article233794772.html
"Man cut brake lines on street scooters, police say",WCNC,NBC,"Charlotte, NC",2019,10,3,"Man cut brake lines on street scooters, police say. Randall Williams is accused of the crime in Fort Lauderdale. The scooters that were vandalized are the same kind riders enjoy in Charlotte. Authorities arrested a man they say cut brake cords on scooters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida -- the same kind of scooters that are on the streets of Charlotte. When folks hop on scooters in the Queen City, they trust they're safe. But imagine getting on one without brakes. A Ring camera caught a man, who police identified as 59-year-old Randall Williams, cutting brake lines on two Lime scooters. ""Oh! You got to be kidding me,"" said Isaac Watrous, a scooter rider in Charlotte. ""So, he just has this thing against (scooters) to hurt people,"" asked Robbie Wise, another Charlotte scooter rider. They were concerned since the Queen City has the same scooters on the streets. ""It's outrage. I mean why would you tamper with something and put someone's life at risk like that?"" added Watrous. Officers in Fort Lauderdale said over six months 140 scooters were vandalized. All of them had their brake cords cut, and they were all within two blocks of Williams's apartment. Authorities believe he could be to blame for all of the incidents. ""For me to be riding, and I can't hit a brake, that's terrible,"" exclaimed Wise. A spokesperson for Lime released this statement: Vandalizing property is a crime and only harms those who rely on these vehicles every day as an affordable, convenient way to get around. We are thankful that Fort Lauderdale PD was able to apprehend a suspect in this case. Lime will pursue appropriate legal action against those that damage or vandalize our property. The company encouraged riders to check scooters for any damage before hopping on. It's something Watrous already does. ""I always check the brakes, you know, I squeeze it and [make sure] it doesn't move. Check the throttle, make sure it's working, make sure the lights are on,"" he said. Williams is facing several charges. Thankfully, nobody was hurt in any of the cases where brake lines were cut, according to Lime. The company noted scooters are picked up overnight for charging, making it difficult to vandalize them during the nighttime hours. Williams allegedly cut the lines in the early morning hours before anyone had the chance to ride.",https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/man-cut-brake-lines-on-street-scooters-police-say/275-9d550fa5-5677-4ede-8b74-0f7d1186322a
Charlotte is piloting corrals where riders are supposed to park their scooters,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2020,1,6,"Charlotte is piloting corrals where riders are supposed to park their scooters. The city of Charlotte is piloting designated e-scooter corrals, where riders are supposed to park their Lime, Bird, or Spin scooter after they’re done with it. Why they’re doing it: The purpose of the effort is to offer parking spots off sidewalks, says Charlotte Department of Transportation spokeswoman Scierra Bratton. That will help ensure safety for all pedestrians using sidewalks, including those with disabilities, she adds. The corrals will give e-scooter companies a place to park the vehicles once they’re done charging overnight. Green markers painted on the ground designate the corrals, some of which are 4-by-6 and fit three scooters. Others will be as large as 4-by-12, Bratton says. Where possible, city transit workers are adding scooter corrals near existing bike racks. E-scooters companies are praising Charlotte’s efforts. CJ Shaw, Lime’s general manager for North Carolina, said it’s exciting to see the city making space for scooters. “Further integrating (scooters) into the city’s landscape can only improve conditions for riders and pedestrians alike,” Shaw said in an email. Spin collaborated with the city on the corrals. A company representative said they’ll train employees who recharge the scooters to prioritize the new corrals. Zoom out: Charlotte’s corral marking comes as the city continues to try to figure out how to regulate e-scooters, which launched here in 2018. Charlotte officials laud scooters as an alternate to driving. But policing them is difficult. You’re supposed to wear a helmet when you’re on a scooter, for instance, but no one will fine you if you don’t. You’re supposed to park your scooter away from pedestrian paths, but no one enforces that. Similarly, no one will be watching to make sure you park your scooter in one of the corrals around town, either. So, it’s unclear how the corrals will help with sidewalk scooter clutter if there’s no enforcement. Corral locations: CDOT marked the first scooter corral on Friday in front of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Government Center on Davidson Street Uptown. The next five went in on Monday in the following spots: Third and Church Fourth and South Mint 15th and North Davidson South Boulevard and Carson (in front of 1100 South Apartments) On Camden in front of Dimensional Place (across from Flower Child) CDOT’s goal is to pilot 25 corrals. They’ll be in scooter-popular areas, including South End, Uptown, Plaza Midwood, and NoDa, Bratton said. So far, the department has identified about a dozen locations, including the ones already marked.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/191749/charlotte-is-piloting-corrals-where-riders-are-supposed-to-park-their-scooters/
Scooters are returning to Charlotte this weekend,Charlotte Agenda,The Agenda,"Charlotte, NC",2020,5,7,"Scooters are returning to Charlotte this weekend. When businesses started to close in March, scooter companies in Charlotte quietly collected their hundreds of little electric vehicles from city sidewalks and parks. You may have noticed their absence. On Saturday, the scooter companies will start a small re-launch of their fleet. The timing aligns with Governor Roy Cooper’s easing of the state’s stay at home restrictions. Beginning Friday afternoon, nonessential businesses can once again operate, albeit with restrictions. The three e-scooter companies — Lime, Bird, and Spin — usually operate 400 scooters apiece. This weekend, Lime and Spin will put 50 scooters back out, says Liz Babson, director of the Charlotte Department of Transportation (CDOT). The companies will work with the city to adjust the size of their fleets moving forward based on demand. Bird will relaunch soon as well, on a date that is to be determined. New focus: Before the coronavirus outbreak, scooter use was highest in dense neighborhoods in and around Uptown, like South End and Plaza Midwood. Now those areas, formerly buzzing with pedestrians and office workers, are quiet. One scooter company, Spin, says it is focusing on the medical community right now, and the essential workers who have mostly remained on the job throughout the pandemic. Spin will deploy scooters near Atrium Health’s Carolinas Medical Center and Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center. Lime will go in Uptown and South End. Bird will go wherever there’s demand. “They’re really trying to be thoughtful during this pandemic … to figure out where they can support the community and what that adjusted business model looks like,” Babson says. Free rides for doctors and nurses: Spin and Lime also will offer free rides for health care workers. Anyone who can validate their employment in Charlotte’s health care industry receives a free 30-minute ride. Lime is launching this effort through a program it’s calling Lime Aid. Qualified health care workers can use this link to sign up. Spin’s is through its Everyday Heroes program, which offers free rides and helmets to the health care community. Medical workers can sign up here. The e-scooter companies say their vehicles provide a safe transportation option during the coronavirus outbreak. A Lime spokesman noted that some residents may not yet want to take ride-sharing services yet, either. “People need a safe way to get around while maintaining appropriate social distance to take essential trips to their jobs as front line workers, or to deliver food and groceries,” Bird spokeswoman Natalie Sawyer said in an email. Separately, Spin has said it is exploring a monthly rental option for its scooters. But it’s early in that process, and there aren’t many details to share yet. New cleaning measures: All three companies have said they’ll have enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures in place during their re-launch. Lime has increased the frequency of the cleaning of its scooters. Lime workers will clean all parts of the scooter that riders touch, and will only use products that the CDC recommends. Spin says every time a scooter is picked up or enters a warehouse, employees will disinfect the main contact points on the scooter with disinfectant spray or wipes. Companies are encouraging riders to wash their hands before and after rides. Zoom out: E-scooters launched here in 2018 and quickly became popular, eclipsing dockless bicycle shares in ridership. Ultimately, the companies that had launched dockless bikes in Charlotte phased them out. Since e-scooters arrived in Charlotte, city officials have grappled with how to regulate them. Earlier this year, the city created designated corrals around town for riders to park their scooters. As of Friday, Charlotte riders had taken 151,451 scooter trips (113,855 miles) so far in 2020, according to the city.",https://www.charlotteagenda.com/218138/scooters-are-returning-to-charlotte-this-weekend/

E-Scooters Expected to Make a Comeback During Pandemic,Spectrum News NC,Spectrum News,"Charlotte, NC",2020,5,11,"E-Scooters Expected to Make a Comeback During Pandemic. When the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, there were less people using public transportation to get around or to go to work. Now that states are slowly starting to re-open, one form of transportation is making a comeback in Charlotte. If you’ve been outside at all in South End or Uptown, you’ve seen more people biking, walking and jogging. But, there’s one thing that’s been missing that used to be a staple in the city. Scierra Bratton with Charlotte DOT says three electric scooter companies: Bird, Lime and Spin began taking scooters off the streets in March. She says the familiar and popular form of transportation was removed after companies saw more people staying at home. C.J. Shaw with Lime says the change didn’t just happen here. “It wasn’t just a Charlotte specific decision. We made the decision as a company to pause all but two of our markets globally,” he said. The 1,200 scooters you used to be able to find anywhere have been gone for about eight weeks, but as of this weekend, they’re rolling back out in Charlotte with some changes. “We are doing in-app messaging, encouraging the riders to make sure that they’re using hand sanitizer, or gloves, or washing their hands after they’ve ended their trip,” Shaw said. And you won’t see the normal amount of scooters either. Each company is starting with only 50 on the streets and they’re also offering free rides to healthcare workers. ""People need a safe way to get around while maintaining appropriate social distance to take essential trips to their jobs as front line workers, or to deliver food and groceries,” Bird spokesperson Natalie Sawyer said. Shaw says they will begin to scale up the fleets once demand increases. He says he expects micro-mobility to take center stage once this pandemic is over. “Coming out of COVID, where people are maybe still hesitant to use crowded buses or subways, or public transportation, they’ll look to micro-mobility as a way that they can safely get around,” he said. While it may take time before ridership returns to normal, it’s giving people a different yet familiar way to get around as we work towards re-opening the state.",https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2020/05/11/e-scooters-expected-to-make-a-comeback-during-pandemic
Bikesharing Is Popular In D.C. Will Scooter-Sharing Be The Next Big Transit Trend?,WAMU,NPR,"Washington, DC",2018,2,27,"Bikesharing Is Popular In D.C. Will Scooter-Sharing Be The Next Big Transit Trend? D.C. commuters are used to sharing cars and bikes. The next big thing: sharing scooters. Waybots, a California-based startup, is rolling out an electric scooter-sharing service in D.C., and a second company will soon follow suit. The arrival marks one more step in the ever expanding market for transportation-sharing services in D.C., which run the gamut from car2go to Capital Bikeshare to five dockless bikeshare companies, which are wrapping up a six-month pilot program in the city. Scooter sharing is basically what it sounds like. You use a phone-based app to find one of Waybots’s yellow electric scooters, pay a fee — $1 to start, and 15 cents per minute thereafter — and use the scooter to get around. Once you get to your destination, you just leave the scooter for someone else to use. Terry Owens, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Transportation, says Waybots just soft-launched in D.C., and hopes to bring between 50 and 400 scooters to the city. The company is entering the market through the ongoing pilot program for dockless bikeshares. “They are governed by the same terms and conditions as the bike companies,” explained Owens, which includes limiting the number of vehicles the deploy and also sharing data with the city on their use. Another scooter-sharing company, Bird, “will be launching in D.C. soon,” according to a company spokesperson. It is already in operation in Los Angeles, where it is based. Bikesharing and now scooter-sharing are part of what’s known as “last-mile” transit options, which help people get from a Metro station to their office or home. Capital Bikeshare has been operating in D.C. since 2010, and the company now has 3,700 bikes at more than 440 stations across D.C., Maryland and Virginia. The new dockless bikeshare companies — Spin, Ofo, Jump, Limebike and Mobike — say they offer more flexibility since their bikes do not have to be locked or picked up at fixed stations like Capital Bikeshare. But the bikes have also prompted complaints from people who say they block sidewalks, are easily stolen and have been found everywhere from local rivers to Metro platforms. But according to DDOT, actual public complaints about the dockless bikes have been limited. Of 336 emailed comments about the bikes, DDOT classified 247 as “explicitly supportive” and 81 as “explicitly opposed.” The dockless bikeshare pilot is expected to wrap up by April, after which city officials will determine what type of permanent presence the bike companies — and possibly the scooter companies — will have in the future.",https://wamu.org/story/18/02/27/bikesharing-popular-d-c-will-scooter-sharing-next-big-transit-trend/

Bird, a Southern California scooter company, is rolling into Washington. The company joins two others that recently started scooter operations in the city and a growing list of start-ups that are taking part in the District’s exploration of new mobility services. The scooters follow the entry of dockless bike-sharing systems last fall and operate under the same terms and conditions set for the bike systems. The motorized scooters available in the District and many other U.S. cities rent for as little as $1 plus 15 cents per minute. The services work similarly to the dockless bike systems, allowing users to track down a scooter via an app and to drop it off just about anywhere after a trip is completed. Bird is in several California markets, including Los Angeles, and has raised $100 million to expand outside the state. Its latest markets include the District, San Francisco and San Diego. A company spokesman said the scooters will be deployed in the District based on rider demand, up to 400, based on city regulations, and will be available in neighborhoods across all four quadrants, including east of the Anacostia and near Howard University, Logan Circle, and the U Street corridor. Scooters can be tracked through the Bird smartphone app. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/03/28/bird-scooters-roll-out-in-d-c-and-its-executive-wants-a-pledge-to-save-our-sidewalks/
Electric scooters become latest dockless travel option in the District,Fox 5,Fox,"Washington, DC",2018,4,7,"Electric scooters become latest dockless travel option in the District. Electric scooters are becoming a new trendy way to get around the nation's capital and several companies are taking part in a pilot program. With traffic congestion and too few parking spaces, D.C. transportation officials are doing everything they can to get people out of vehicles and are trying to provide other ways for people to get around the city. In recent years, there has been an explosion of rental options to get around - Capital Bikeshare, dockless bikes and now - scooters. Renting one of these electric scooters is similar to dockless bike systems. All you need is an app, scan a barcode, give it a kickstart and off you go. And they do not need to be docked. LimeBike, one of the companies that has launched a fleet of electric scooters in D.C., says on its website it costs $1 to unlock it and a per-minute fee to ride them - usually $.15 per minute in most areas. D.C. officials said there have been no major complaints so far with these scooters in the city, but there are a limited number on the streets. However in San Francisco, many people are up in arms because the scooters are crowding pedestrians off sidewalks and are being parked all over the place. There have been reports of some scooters being trashed or even defaced with feces. There have been complaints in the District with dockless bikes because people have been parking them in the middle of sidewalks, streets, parks and even on the National Mall. For those interested in traveling around D.C. with these electric scooters, riding them on sidewalks in downtown areas of the city is prohibited - similar to bikes.

Are Those Electric Scooters Actually Allowed on the Sidewalk? Here Are the Rules,Washingtonian,,"Washington, DC",2018,4,20,"Are Those Electric Scooters Actually Allowed on the Sidewalk? Here Are the Rules. What you can and can't do with dockless transportation. Those electric scooters that have appeared around town are cheap to rent, can park anywhere, and zip you from points A to B at about 15 mph. But what are the rules for these things? Are they allowed on the sidewalks? Can you scoot in bike lanes? Do you need a helmet? Electric scooters technically abide by the city’s regulations on personal mobility devices, which are similar to cycling guidelines, says a DC Department of Transportation spokesperson. While bike lanes are a go, neither cyclists nor scooterists are allowed to ride on sidewalks in the city’s central business district, which, roughly speaking, includes much of the area between Union Station and George Washington University and from the Mall to Massachusetts Avenue. (You are, however, allowed to ride on sidewalks wherever the National Park Service has oversight, such as Dupont Circle.) In DC, scooter users aren’t required to wear helmets, carry insurance, or have a license, though you do have to be over 16 to operate one. Through the end of April, any company that has a business license, insurance, and sufficient safety data can provide up to 400 scooters in the District. Right now, three companies have placed two-wheelers on the streets: Bird, Waybots, and Lime-S. To locate and rent them, you simply use a phone app. They’re all $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute afterward (a price higher than most bike share options, which start at $1 or $2 per half-hour). As with any new form of transportation, etiquette is a work in progress. After complaints in San Francisco about scooters left in piles on the street or parked in inconvenient spots, the city began impounding scooters, and scooters now require a permit to park on sidewalks. And in DC, a recent cleanup by the Rock Creek Conservancy found five dockless bikes and one dockless scooter thrown into the water. To combat such problems, Bird issued a pledge to keep sidewalks clean and to donate money to city governments to help build more bike lines. Issued to other dockless transportation companies like LimeBike, Ofo, and Jump, it asked that all work together to make the process as appealing to city governments as possible. DDOT says it hasn’t heard of any scooter-related accidents, and MPD was unable to confirm whether there’d been any recorded incidents, either. Still, some lessons from cycling apply to anyone who wants to stay safe on an electric scooter: Wear a helmet, follow traffic rules, signal your turns, and always strive to be predictable. However, sadly there is no lesson that will keep you from looking like a dork on a scooter.",https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/04/20/are-those-electric-scooters-actually-allowed-on-the-sidewalk-here-are-the-rules/
D.C. withdraws plan targeting dockless bike operations with fees and parking demands,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,4,28,"D.C. withdraws plan targeting dockless bike operations with fees and parking demands. The District has abandoned a plan that would have imposed hefty operating fees and regulations on the operators of dockless bike and scooter systems. Instead, the city is extending — without changes — its pilot program for another four months, through August. The proposed regulations sought to govern how the private companies operate their services in the city, but the plan was criticized within the industry and many in the biking community who said the District’s approach threatened efforts to grow bike and scooter travel in the nation’s capital. Amid the pressure, the District Department of Transportation abruptly dropped the plan that officials had previewed for advocates and business leaders as recently as Wednesday. Bike and scooter operators learned about the proposal April 19. “We are extending the program in its current form. No changes,” DDOT spokesman Terry L. Owens said late Thursday, a day after he had confirmed discussions of the new regulations and plans to unveil them Friday as part of phase two of the pilot. The dockless bikes, which rent for as little as $1, have clogged city sidewalks since the District launched a tryout in September; electric scooters followed this spring and have become another popular option. The District was one of the first major cities to welcome the new technology, which has since grown exponentially across the country. The experiment with the app-based systems has boosted biking in segments of the population that didn’t use the region’s Capital Bikeshare system, among them younger, lower-income riders and people of color. But it also has ignited conflict as residents and other road users have complained about bikes and scooters being left in parks; dumped along creeks, buildings and monuments; and blocking pedestrian access. In public meetings and forums, the vehicles have been called “urban trash” and “sidewalk clutter.” The regulations, which were secretly presented to the industry, outlined requirements around parking and other operating procedures. They included fees that amounted to about $200 per bike in service and required companies to implement double kickstands or “lock to” capabilities on their two-wheelers and to install bike racks in yet-to-be-designated areas to facilitate parking, according to several people who were briefed on the plans. Only Jump bikes, the company recently acquired by Uber, features an integrated U-lock that is held magnetically to the frame of its e-bikes. City transportation officials had spent months drafting the rules they hoped would strike a balance, allowing the services to continue to operate while addressing the public’s concerns. Plans were to enact the regulations after the conclusion of the pilot phase, which was scheduled to end Monday. It is unclear whether the city is merely putting the regulations on hold or ditching them completely as it extends the pilot to continue studying how the services are working. Seven companies have dockless services in the District. Spin, Mobike, Ofo and LimeBike offer regular bicycles. Jump’s fleet is 100 electric bikes. Bird and Waybots provide scooters. LimeBike has scooters and bikes in its D.C. fleet. Other cities have implemented similar regulations, including fees per bicycle, but the industry complained that the District would have had the highest fee per bike in the country. It would have amounted to an $80,000 annual payment to the city from each company that deploys 400 vehicles — the maximum number allowed under the city’s rules. “The fee size is effectively telling the private sector to go away,” one company executive said. “It is not an incentive for folks to come to D.C. and operate,” an official with another company said. “We know that D.C. is a forward-looking city and has embraced technology and was one of the first to embrace ride sharing across the country, but you impose taxes like these on companies to operate, and it’s really tough to do so. .?.?. It is really excessive. It is a massive tax on tech companies.” The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly and to not jeopardize their relationship with the city. In Seattle, bike-share companies pay $149 for an annual bike-share license and $15 per bike. Durham, N.C., charges a $250 application fee and $10 per bike. And St. Louis charges a $500 annual permit fee and $10 per bike each year. As the demonstration period continues in the District through August, the stationless operations will continue to have a maximum fleet of 400 vehicles. City officials also had considered keeping the size restriction and limiting the number of scooters within that cap to 100 for the companies that offer both services. David Alpert, executive director of D.C. Sustainable Transportation, a coalition of advocates, businesses and government agencies working on issues around transportation, said advocates and business leaders had concerns about the regulations having a negative impact on the pilot program, which despite its hiccups is considered to have been generally a good option for residents who wouldn’t otherwise choose bike sharing. “Reasonable regulations make sense, I think everyone agrees,” Alpert said. He said more data collection during the summer, when usage is higher, would help guide the city to “strike that balance about doing what’s reasonable to protect the public, making sure that [biking] can grow and providing people transportation.” “It has allowed people to have biking as a choice, people to have the opportunity. It is a valuable program,” Alpert said. “People would really like it to be successful.” He said advocates and business leaders acknowledge that there have been problems, including bikes dumped in canals and those blocking access, but there are signs that people have grown more accustomed to how to ride and park them properly, he said. Companies, too, welcomed the city’s decision to proceed without the changes, at least for now. “We appreciate the DDOT for taking a thoughtful approach in determining the future of dockless shared mobility in the District, and we look forward to continuing to work together to craft rules that promote innovation, equity and consumer safety,” said Taylor Bennett, a spokesman for China-based Ofo. The unchanged cap on the number of vehicles allowed, however, is still a concern for the companies, whose leaders say it is shortsighted to impose an arbitrary limit that doesn’t allow them to grow or effectively serve all sectors of the District. The cap of 400 was a good start for the testing period, company officials said, but it is now a disservice to residents who have embraced the bike-share systems and have come to expect greater access to them. They said the cap prevents them from being able to serve the entire city, where some estimate there is demand for as many as 20,000 bicycles. And restricting the number of scooters, they complained, is shortsighted given that their use rate is higher than that of the bikes. The scooters also have helped reduce parking problems because the companies pick them up each night and put them back each morning, company officials said. “We support a regulatory framework that allows us to boost transportation equity,” LimeBike spokeswoman Mary Caroline Pruitt said before the regulations were withdrawn. As the program continues, the companies are bound by a permit that requires them to ensure their bikes and scooters are in working order, well-maintained and clean, and in compliance with city biking law. Bikes cannot be parked on landscaped areas, at bus stops or shelters, or blocking Capital Bikeshare stations, driveways, curb ramps or loading zones. And they can’t block pedestrian pathways. Riding them on downtown sidewalks is prohibited. Companies are required to move improperly parked bikes and scooters within two hours of receiving a complaint. And the bikes must be available in all eight wards of the District to ensure access to all residents. The companies said they will continue to work with DDOT to craft a “common-sense regulatory framework” that protects consumer safety and allows for greater choice. DDOT said it also will continue to work with the companies as the dockless demonstration is continued in coming months. “During the extension, we will continue to work with the participating companies to find remedies to concerns raised by the community during the first few months of the pilot,” the agency said in a statement. “DDOT will also continue to collect data as we evaluate the impact of the program through the warmer months.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dc-withdraws-plan-targeting-dockless-bike-operations-with-fees-and-parking-demands/2018/04/28/2d89c64e-48ca-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html
Six Months Of Dockless Bikes And Scooters: Fad Or Fixture?,WAMU,NPR,"Washington, DC",2018,4,30,"Six Months Of Dockless Bikes And Scooters: Fad Or Fixture? First came the brightly colored bikes: silver bikes, yellow bikes, electric red bikes, orange bikes, lime green bikes. Then came the electric scooters, whizzing down sidewalks. Since September, more than half a dozen companies have swooped into the city with the next big thing in transportation: dockless shared bikes and scooters, with rides starting at just $1. Some see them as the dawn of a new era in urban transportation. Others see them as an unsightly intrusion on public space. D.C. was one of the first cities in the nation to welcome these two-wheelers. The bikes were originally installed under a six-month pilot program, ending April 30. The District has just granted the companies a four-month extension. Are they here to stay? Will they become an integral part of D.C. multimodal transportation system? Or will these brightly colored bikes and scooters fade from the streets as quickly as they appeared? Fast And Fun For many residents, the bikes and scooters have already changed how they get around. According to the bikeshare companies, more than 120,000 riders have collectively taken more than 300,000 rides on their vehicles since September. For Michelle Basselet, dockless bikes have meant a much shorter commute. “If I were to take the Metro it would be probably like a 45-minute commute,” she says, unlocking a bright red Jump bike in Columbia Heights. Before the dockless bikes, she would either ride Metro, or in a pinch she’d take an Uber or drive. “If I take the car in the morning I have to allot like 35 minutes.” Now, she rides a bike — she prefers the red electric-assist Jump bikes if there’s one available. The ride takes all of 10 minutes — breezing by car traffic, and avoiding Metro’s circuitous route. Her roommates are converts, too. “Yeah we weren’t biking before we had these, so it’s kind of switched our commute around.” A few blocks away, Meghan Anand is unlocking an electric scooter for her commute. “I like to bike to work, but sometimes that’s outfit restrictive,” she says as her Bird scooter chirps, unlocked and ready to ride. “This is much easier. You can wear a dress, you can wear a skirt, you don’t have to plan all the logistics.” Plus, she says, it’s way more fun than being stuck in traffic or on a crowded bus. “I mean, you feel like you’re four or five years old again riding a scooter in your neighborhood. I’m sure I look pretty stupid, but it is fun,” Anand says. D.C. has one of the most successful and oldest docked bikeshare systems in the United States, with close to 4,000 red and yellow Capital Bikeshare bikes spread across the region and funded by the government. But there are gaps in that system, and biking dockless has the advantage of being able to park right outside your destination — no hunting for an open dock. The electrified options, including Jump bikes, Way Bot, Lime and Bird scooters, are fast and sweat-free, making them attractive to commuters. They’re great for a short trip or for the “last mile” — getting from the Metro station or bus stop to your office door. It’s A Bike! Call The Police! Just as quickly as people started hopping on this new mode of transportation, others started seeing problems. The bikes are an eyesore. The scooters are a hazard zipping past pedestrians. They’re always blocking sidewalks and ramps, getting vandalized and thrown in the park (and the canal, and the creek.) “We found five bikes in the physical creek and one scooter, as well as a couple of bikes sporadically dumped in the area as well,” says Katy Cain, communications manager with Rock Creek Conservancy, which recently held a big creek cleanup. Along with the usual plastic bottles and coffee cups, there was something new this year: shared bikes. Cain says her group is in favor of dockless bikes, and biking in general, but, “We are just against people leaving dockless bikes in the creek.” Cars after all —and the roads they require — are a much bigger polluter of the watershed. Bikeshare and scootershare operators say they can reduce car trips — helping the District meet its goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and eliminate traffic fatalities. Then there was the time Georgetown residents were emailing on a listserv about calling 911 to report dockless bikes in their neighborhood. It was Justin Norton’s idea. “My intention was never to racially profile or segregate Georgetown from the rest of D.C.,” Norton says. “When the bike becomes a hindrance to you,” he says, “you have every duly authorized right and responsibility to call 311, to call 911 and get the city to act.” The Metropolitan Police Department was not amused: Though 911 may not be the best recourse, poorly parked bikes and scooters have been a hindrance —particularly to people with disabilities. “It’s pissing a lot of people off,” says David Nelson, who is in a wheelchair. He says he frequently sees dockless bikes downtown parked right in the middle of the sidewalk, or in the curb cut. “If it’s in my way and I can’t get around it, I’m just going to knock it over, since I can’t move it.” He says he’s had to knock over dockless bikes 10 or 15 times since they arrived. Sensible Fixes Or Onerous Requirements? The past six months have been an experiment, a pilot program slated to end April 30. Seven companies signed agreements with the city in September, limiting them to 400 bikes or scooters each, and holding them to a few other rules of the road. Cities across the country have been struggling to find the right approach to the the two-wheeled newcomers. Some, like San Francisco, have declared war, rounding up and impounding scooters and issuing cease-and-desist orders. Others, like Seattle, have welcomed them, with permits carefully spelling out requirements and expectations, and with built in incentives for good behavior. In D.C., officials have been considering new regulations, including requirements that bikes lock to a fixed object or include a sturdier double kickstand, and fees that the dockless companies say would have made it impossible to operate in the city long-term. The new plan would have also kept in place the 400 bike cap, which companies say is far too low to make a profit and provide a reliable service for customers. In the end, the District Department of Transportation decided to put off a decision until August, instead extending the current pilot rules. In a statement DDOT says it will continue to work with the companies “to find remedies to concerns raised by the community during the first few months of the pilot.” DDOT says it will continue to “collect data as we evaluate the impact of the program,” but provided no plan for growing the program in the future. David Alpert runs the website Greater Greater Washington, and is the executive director of D.C. Sustainable Transportation, a group that worked with bikeshare companies in the city to agree on a set of principles for the future. “We’re in favor of dockless mobility, and want to see it succeed,” he says. “And we want to see bike modeshare increase, more people be able to ride bikes, and people in more communities, more diverse groups of people.” Alpert says it makes sense for the District to regulate the companies to address the problems and complaints, but hopes the regulations won’t strangle the industry. Dockless … What? “You can’t stymie innovation,” says transportation consultant and author Gabe Klein. “It’ll just pop up somewhere else.” Klein used to run the District Department of Transportation and was one of the people behind the region’s docked bikeshare system, Capital Bikeshare, which launched in 2010. He says whatever happens with this dockless experiment, “active mobility is here to stay.” He says things like bikes and scooters — especially electric ones — are the future. “Once people realize how quickly, easily and safely they can get from one point to another that’s one, two and three miles away, active transportation is going to be probably the primary mode of getting around. That is awesome.” Right now, he says, the change is happening so quickly, it’s exciting, but also messy and chaotic. When Capital Bikeshare launched, there were plenty of doubters too. But the system is now widely embraced. It’s one of the three biggest systems in the country, recently celebrating its 20 millionth ride. Perhaps more significant: the share of people commuting by bike in D.C. has nearly quintupled since Capital Bikeshare was launched — from around one percent to nearly five percent. Klein says bikeshare made a bigger difference than bike lanes or other infrastructure improvements. “More than anything in D.C., the culture has changed on the streets.” Now, Klein says, dockless shared bikes — especially the electric ones — could spark a similarly profound change. And it may not be only dockless bikes and scooters. What’s the next dockless innovation? It’s a question Klein gets all the time: “And I’m like, ‘Definitely hover shoes. But I don’t know if people are going to share them, so there may not be a business in that.'”",https://wamu.org/story/18/04/30/six-months-dockless-bikes-scooters-fad-fixture/
Bird’s Dockless Electric Scooters Now Available in Arlington,ARLnow,,"Washington, DC",2018,6,25,"Bird’s Dockless Electric Scooters Now Available in Arlington. Dockless electric scooters have now made their way to Arlington. The electric vehicle company Bird scattered dozens of its scooters across the county on Sunday (June 24), becoming the first company to offer the vehicles in Arlington. Bird’s operated in D.C. for the past few months, in addition to several other electric bike and scooter “ride sharing” firms like Lime and Skip. Company spokesman Nick Samonas says Bird scooters are now available in Ballston, Clarendon, Crystal City, Pentagon City and some areas along Columbia Pike, and he noted that “as ridership grows, the company will expand its fleet to serve all of Arlington’s residents and communities.” “As Arlington rapidly develops, it’s clear there’s an urgent need for additional transit options that are accessible, affordable and reliable for all residents and local communities,” Samonas wrote in an email. “Birds are a great solution for short ‘last mile’ trips that are too long to walk, but too short to drive.” Anyone hoping to use the scooters needs to download the company’s mobile app, then use it to find an available scooter. The app then guides would-be riders through the process of piloting the scooter, parking it and, of course, paying for the ride. Bird charges a base fee to “unlock” each scooter, then assess an additional fee based on how long riders use the vehicle. Samonas declined to discuss how many scooters the company has made available across Arlington — though a quick scan of the app Monday morning shows more than 50 scooters around the county — but he said the company will only add more vehicles “when each is being ridden three or more times per day.” Spokesmen for Lime and Skip, the other dockless scooter companies operating in D.C., didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they plan to follow suit and expand to Arlington. As of Monday morning, Lime’s app does show one scooter available just outside Crystal City; Skip’s scooters, meanwhile, remain on the other side of the Potomac River for now.",https://www.arlnow.com/2018/06/25/birds-dockless-electric-scooters-now-available-in-arlington/
D.C. proposal aims to ‘control’ e-scooters,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,6,25,"D.C. proposal aims to ‘control’ e-scooters. A bill introduced by Council member Mary M. Cheh would set rules for where scooters can be parked, establish new speed limits and set hours for their use. Legislation before the D.C. Council aims to address the myriad complaints about e-scooter operations in the nation’s capital, including that the devices are left everywhere, ridden where they shouldn’t be and are a hazard to pedestrians. A bill introduced by Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) would set rules for where scooters can be parked, establish new speed limits and ban their use between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. The legislation would give the city transportation agency the authority to fine operators that fail to address complaints and revoke their operations permit if they consistently fail to abide by the rules. The District Department of Transportation, which regulates the services, has established rules to keep the scooter companies in check, but Cheh said her legislation sets needed parameters and makes scooter use in the city safer. “It’s a wonderful thing to have the scooters,” Cheh said. “But it’s a little bit like the Wild West at the moment.” The proposal comes as scooter usage appears to be on the rise in the District, one of the first U.S. cities to allow the services. Nearly 1 in 6 District residents used e-scooters in the past year, according to a recent Washington Post poll, including 6 percent who used them at least a few times a week. But despite growing enthusiasm for the personal mobility devices, they have also brought new challenges. Critics say scooters are cluttering sidewalks, and worse, creating dangerous encounters with pedestrians on narrow sidewalks. Although scooters are banned from sidewalks in downtown Washington, riders are regularly spotted doing in restricted areas. Cheh’s bill would require DDOT to put up signs to more clearly label the restriction in the central business district. The bill also establishes designated parking for the two-wheel devices and penalties for operators who fail to remove a badly parked scooter within three hours after it has been reported. The proposal would increase the scooter speed limit to 15 miles per hour (from 10 mph) on a street or bike lane and reduce the speed limit to 6 mph while operating on a sidewalk. Five companies are operating scooters in the District: Bird, Jump, Lime, Lyft and Spin. One company, Skip, has temporarily been suspended after a several fires involving its equipment. Cheh’s proposal — co-sponsored by Council members Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) — would ban the use of scooters overnight, a measure aimed at preventing crashes. A recent study of scooter injuries in Austin by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about 40 percent of scooter injuries occurred between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., indicating more problems during hours when it was dark. The study also found that more than a third of those injured said that excessive speed contributed to their injury, and about 30 percent reported drinking alcohol before riding. Some companies have said they generally don’t have their scooters in service overnight or during bad-weather events. Still, Cheh’s proposal to restrict the hours of operation is likely to draw some of the most passionate criticism — and support. Some users said on Twitter that they rely on the scooters to get around at night when public transit is limited. Metro stops running at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights. But others said keeping scooters off the streets at night is a good idea because it is difficult to spot riders in the dark. Cheh said in an interview that she wasn’t particularly wedded to the overnight restriction. “For the folks coming out of bars and taverns late at night, is that the best way for them to come home?” Cheh said. “But it may be, when I’m trying to collect all the data, that’s actually the safest time to operate.” Other aspects of the bill include: Requiring operators to maintain a 24-hour toll-free phone number for members of the public to report illegally parked scooters. Requiring operators to pay a bond to the District that will be used to pay for any damage their devices cause to public property. Requiring each operator to maintain at least 10 percent of its fleet in each ward by 6 a.m. Setting the electric-bicycle speed limit to 20 miles per hour on the street. Requiring operators to release fleet, trip and complaint data to the DDOT. The rules mirror some of the regulations already set by DDOT that went into effect in January, when the agency launched a more permanent program for scooters and dockless bikes. The city then established fees for operators and maintained a cap on the number of scooters each companies is allowed to deploy. The operational permit also requires companies to deploy scooters to all eight wards of the city and to offer special pricing plans for low-income people. Under the DDOT rules, all companies are also required to have a toll-free telephone number printed on their vehicles where callers can report bikes and scooters found parked illegally. DDOT officials have said they continue to work with the operators to urge more education about proper scooter parking. Cheh said the legislation will help put more pressure on the companies to educate users. Scooters have become such an important mode of transportation in the District that D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) on Tuesday asked the Capitol Police to amend its policies that prohibit electric scooters on the Capitol grounds. Norton, in a letter to Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund, said “increasing numbers of Hill staffers” along with city residents and visitors rely on the scooters to get around. ""As such, electric scooters should be treated like motorized bicycles, mopeds, segways, and the other low-speed vehicles” already permitted around the Capitol, Norton said. “Despite the prohibition, scooters are widely used on Capitol Grounds, apparently without mishap.” Cheh says her bill is an early draft and a starting point for discussion. She plans to hold a hearing on it — and scooters more broadly — in the fall. “It takes a while for people to understand the rules and to follow the rules,” Cheh said. “This is the beginning of having the scooter culture settle down into safe operations.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/06/25/dc-proposal-aims-control-e-scooters/
"Dockless bike, scooter firms clash with U.S. cities over regulations",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,8,4,"Dockless bike, scooter firms clash with U.S. cities over regulations. The U.S. experiment with dockless bike and scooter sharing is at a crossroads, with operators and cities struggling to find a balance between governments’ need to regulate the services without stifling the companies’ ability to make money. Dockless bike-sharing giant Ofo has pulled out of several major U.S. markets — including the District, Chicago and Miami — citing regulatory hurdles, while backlash has restrained the explosive growth of scooter operations in cities from San Francisco to Cambridge, Mass. “What we are seeing around the country is a very rapidly evolving system,” Seattle City Council member Mike O’Brien said last week before the council approved one of the most comprehensive sets of regulations for the industry in the nation. Dockless bike systems began to pop up in the United States a year ago, growing exponentially in part thanks to the millions of dollars that investors such as Uber and Google have put into companies such as Lime, Jump Bikes and Bird. While many communities were excited by the opportunity dockless bikes and scooters presented to expand car-free commuting options for residents, they were unprepared for the massive growth and the public backlash as abandoned bikes and scooters began littering sidewalks, parks and other public spaces. The lack of regulation also has led to increased tension among other road users — and pedestrians — over issues such as right of way and where the vehicles are permitted. In the nation’s capital, one of the first U.S. cities to permit the dockless services, Chinese competitors Ofo and Mobike recently pulled their services, citing the District’s restrictions on fleet size and its slowness in moving the program from the pilot phase to permanent. Many residents who have come to depend on the services are working with advocates to push D.C. regulators to reconsider their rules. They succeeded in convincing the city to abandon an unpopular plan to impose a $200-per-bike fee on operators and are now urging the city to consider lifting the cap on fleets from 400 per company to allow up to 20,000 dockless bikes in the District. Elsewhere, cities are still trying to find the right approach. Some have banned the services, reacting to the unannounced arrival of the scooters and bikes with “cease and desist” orders. San Francisco banned all shared e-scooters in June, forcing companies to stop operations and go through a permitting process. A Los Angeles City Council member last week called for a ban on scooters and asked the city to issue cease-and-desist letters to companies already operating there. Meanwhile, the Seattle City Council voted to allow up to 20,000 bikes, doubling the number now available. But with the expansion, the city also adopted a plan to allow four companies to operate up to 5,000 bikes each — as long as they pay the city an annual fee of $250,000. “Some cities are finding they regulated too much too quickly,” said Paul Lewis, vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center for Transportation. “The bottom line is, they want more people bicycling and scootering and things that don’t involve driving a car.” They also may find their regulations unpopular among the commuting public, he said, which studies suggest has generally positive views of the dockless services. Many residents frustrated by troubled transit systems are willing to give the services a try. In the District, Mobike said the 400-bike cap was too small to serve the entire city and provide reliable service. By comparison, in Milan, a service area similar in size to the District, the company operates 8,000 bikes. “Overall, there is very good growth in other cities and other countries,” said Chris Martin, vice president of international expansion and operations at Mobike. “They have set regulation that works to make the business sustainable and help it grow.” Ofo officials have criticized caps on fleets as shortsighted and a barrier for companies to succeed. It called Seattle’s newly approved fee “exorbitant.” “With Ofo’s rate of $1 per ride, the updated $250,000 annual fee makes it impossible for us to effectively serve our riders,” said Lina Feng, general manager of Ofo Seattle. Restrictions on scooter operations led San Francisco-based Spin to pull out of some cities, said Brian No, the company’s head of policy. Experts say American cities have taken a tougher approach in regulating the services than their counterparts in Europe, where the focus has centered on addressing public space issues and vandalism and theft. U.S. cities were among the first to implement operating fees ranging from a couple hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. They also have more rigorously applied caps on fleet sizes in an effort to avoid oversupply scenarios like those in China, where images of hundreds and thousands of abandoned bikes piled atop one another have drawn criticism. “That element has made operating in the U.S. a little more challenging for some companies,” said Dana Yanocha, senior research associate at the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, which studies the dockless industry. As a result, dockless companies have shifted their strategy for entering U.S. markets from lobbying officials for permission to operate to showing up unannounced — similar to the way Uber and other transportation start-ups did. Their rationale: If there are no regulations prohibiting their operations, there is no harm in launching without permission. “We won’t launch in a city if our legal analysis tells us it is illegal,” said Dave Estrada, head of government relations and policy at Bird, which is operating in more than 30 markets. The company was ordered out of Somerville and Cambridge, Mass., last week just days after launching. “We look at city ordinances and state law, and in both cases, we don’t find that our system is illegal,” Estrada said. “What has happened in some cities is, some of them have pushed back.” Toby Sun, chief executive of Lime, which launched on a North Carolina college campus just over a year ago and is now in more than 70 markets across four countries, said regulations are understandable, but if they are too tough, they can imperil the programs in places like the District where demand is high. Higher operational fees, he said, may result in higher costs for users who now can rent bikes for $1 for a 30-minute ride and scooters for $1 to start plus 15 cents a minute. “It poses more challenges for us to provide affordable transportation,” he said. Critics of the programs, however, say cities aren’t regulating enough. “If they get their wishes and the city grants them the ability to have thousands of bikes on the sidewalks, the obstacles, the potential for tripping and injury will grow exponentially,” said Steven Richert, a personal fitness trainer in the District who works with the elderly and people with disabilities who struggle to navigate city streets. “What I would hope cities would do is to stop this program before it gets any worse. But at least begin to regulate it, which they haven’t done.” Transportation officials and advocates for multimodal transportation options say the sidewalk problems can be remedied with regulation, education and enforcement. Studies and companies report complaints are dwindling as users learn dockless decorum, companies implement incentives and penalties for reckless usage, and the communities adjust to the new services. What cities are likely to continue to wrestle with is finding the right regulations to govern the services, from what their ideal number of devices is to determining reasonable operational fees. And they may continue to face that question as more technologies emerge. “These private companies aren’t going away,” Yanocha said. “It is really up to the city to be able to respond to these type of emerging technologies.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dockless-bike-scooter-firms-clash-with-us-cities-over-regulations/2018/08/04/0db29bd0-9419-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html
More shared scooters are coming to the District’s streets,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,8,21,"More shared scooters are coming to the District’s streets. In popularity, the electronic scooter gets ahead of the dockless bike. Love it or hate it, more electric scooters are on the way to the nation’s capital. San Francisco-based start-up Spin, one of several companies that arrived in the District as part of the dockless bike-share hype last September, says it’s removing its bright orange bikes from city sidewalks and replacing them with scooters, an attempt to catch up with competitors who have found the scooter to be a more lucrative option than the bike. “When given the option, demand for scooters is 10 times more than for bikes,” said Brian No, Spin’s head of public policy. “We need to focus on what the consumers really want.” Most companies that are now operating a dockless personal transportation system in the city offer scooters as their primary product — a major shift from a year ago when they arrived in the city with bike fleets promising to expand bike-sharing and bike commuting. The exception is Jump, the Uber-owned company that runs electric bikes. Also operating in the city are scooter providers Bird, Skip and Lime. Lime also began its business with regular bikes, but has in the past year transitioned to renting scooters and electric bikes. It offers more scooters than bikes in the city. The dockless systems have become a popular option to get around for millennials, tourists and many commuters frustrated by the region’s troubled public transit system. Users have embraced them as an alternative to buses or the rail system for short trips and for getting around traffic-choked downtown. Tourists hop on them to get to monuments and attractions. The motorized scooters arrived in February, renting for as little as $1 plus 15 cents per minute. The dockless bikes rent for as little as $1 per 30-minute ride. But the personal travel devices have added a level of complexity to Washington’s grid. Roads have become more perilous to navigate as people on scooters travel on general lanes and bike lanes, joining scores of bike commuters in a city dominated by cars. Pedestrians are adjusting to navigating through scooters and bikes parked along busy segments of downtown. If the city is to continue the program, critics and even users say, more enforcement of the use of right of way will be needed. The city is expected to decide soon whether it will expand the program, which has remained a pilot since its inception in September. The testing period is expected to end on Aug. 31. District transportation officials have said they are evaluating the program. Two companies — Ofo and Mobike — left the pilot this summer after disagreements with the city over a fleet cap. At stake is how much the city will regulate the industry; what fees, if any, the companies will be required to pay; and whether a cap on fleets will remain. Currently, companies are allowed to have a maximum of 400 bikes or scooters or a combination of both. They are mandated to have their products available in all eight wards, a requirement that the companies have barely met, as their fleets are mostly available in Northwest Washington. No said this week that Spin scooters are likely to arrive in the District this fall. The company is awaiting more details from the city about what comes after the conclusion of the pilot, he said. “We are evaluating when to bring and operate scooters in D.C.,” he said. In an interview last month, No said that the company supports ""common-sense regulation.” “It would be naive for us to think that this is something that can go unregulated.” he said. Most of Spin’s bikes were being deployed near the World Bank complex in Northwest Washington. But the bikes had been almost nonexistent in the city for months as the company prepared to re-brand itself as a scooter provider. The company this summer has been pulling out of some cities where scooters are not allowed and transitioning to scooters-only service in other U.S. markets. The company said in an email that transition has begun in the District. “We’re proud to be providing innovative mobility solutions in the District, and we’ll be back soon with scooters!” the company said. Anyone who purchased a Spin bike pass will be refunded, the company said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2018/08/21/more-shared-scooters-are-coming-streets-dc/
The electric scooters swarming our city won’t solve our commuting calamity,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,8,27,"The electric scooters swarming our city won’t solve our commuting calamity. What we really want are jet packs and flying cars, okay? We need to George Jetson and Marty McFly our way out of our traffic and commuting calamity. Light rail, Mag-Lev, even a reliable Metro would work, too. The electric scooters swarming our city this summer? Not the answer. They’re like what happens if my son’s fifth grade squad took over the city planning commission and PeeWee Herman was their board chairman. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve tried the scooters, and they’re totally fun, cheap and effective. They are perfect answer to what used to be a sweaty, five-block walk in between meetings in downtown D.C. But many of the 65 or so U.S. cities — from Washington to San Francisco — are confounded by what to do with the traffic newcomer. Should the motorized scooters be regulated like cars? Bikes? Or pedestrians? Government folks, who love a good committee hearing, are miffed by the way the new economy goes about these things. The main scooter companies — born in the West Coast’s tech sector — soft open their product by dropping the scooters in cities, then negotiating with frazzled city councils later. It’s the ethos borrowed from one of the tech world’s earliest disrupters, computer programmer and Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, who famously said “It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.” So here they are, thousands of whizzing electric scooters, dropped on cities with little planning. Drivers hate seeing them flit into streets, pedestrians get jangled when one whizzes by close enough to ruffle arm hairs. They are various shades of legal just about everywhere. New York City is trying to regulate them before the companies release them into the wild. In Maryland, Montgomery County launched a preemptive bill to avoid the guerrilla launch that is the hallmark of the dockless ride industry. In Virginia, Arlington County was forced to draft something last month when the scooters showed up without warning. D.C. has a pilot program allowing a certain number of the dockless scooters that ends this week. I’m not cheezed off they’re being left in the middle of sidewalks and streets, though Twitter is filled with photos of folks unhappy Washington suddenly looks like my living room. I have boys, so I’m constantly dodging flying objects and stepping over things. And this isn’t another old-person rant about being buzzed by one on the sidewalk — though that did happen to me three times in one 10-minute trip last week, first by a scooter, then by a dude in a black helmet and a motorized skateboard, then by a guy on something that looked like a Robotic vacuum cleaner he rode like the cave man in the B.C. comic strip. That’s not my beef with these things. Here’s my problem: the variety of devices on our streets — combined with the epic and enduring bikes-versus-pedestrians saga — will keep sucking the air out of a transportation conversation that has to become more urgent. Scooters are a tiny solution for a tiny population. The very first scooters I saw were flying manbuns. The method of transportation is largely the arena of the hoodie and backpack crowd, though I have seen more tourists jumping on over the past few weeks. A recent survey of 7,000 scooter riders in 10 cities showed the scooter crowd is growing a bit more diverse, with women renting scooters more than they used bike shares and low-income folks becoming more frequent users, according to transportation think tank Populus. Maybe. But the way it looks from the road, they are primarily being used by mobile, agile young folks who can no longer be bothered with Metro or bus schedules or walking. They’re not taking a car off the road, they’re taking a rider out of public transportation. And who could blame them? I’ve ditched Metro dozens of times because I needed to be on time. To make massive scooter use feasible, we need California weather 365 days a year and infrastructure — lanes — to safely support all those riders. Isn’t it more humane to work on bigger solutions instead? The world of electric scooters does little for the construction workers, hospitality workers, janitors, maids and nurses who live in cheaper housing outside the city and have to crawl through pre-dawn gridlock to drop the kids at day care and get to work or take three buses each way to their jobs. I don’t see secretaries from Germantown, teachers from Bowie or paralegals from Falls Church solving all their commuting woes by scootering to work. Great fun and hoorah for a whole generation of young workers who will never know the experience of being groped or hounded on Metro, but the personal wheels are a zero for real change. This debate began years ago with Segways. Then people lost their minds over where to put BikeShare racks. Here we are, a decade later, bickering over scooters on sidewalks while Metro still struggles. The energy spent on micromanaging the street toys of the young needs to go into real infrastructure and development. We used to be a nation of builders, of movement and innovation. Our decaying public transportation is becoming a joke while cowboy entrepreneurs — Uber and Lyft among them — come in with innovative solutions that fix a hole, but do little for an entire system. “The change reflects deliberate choices in public policy. During the Obama years, Republicans fought fiercely against any increase in public investment in mass transit and advanced rail systems,” wrote Ronald A. Klain, a former Obama and Clinton White House adviser in a Washington Post opinion piece in June. “In 2016, decrying the crumbling state of our public infrastructure, President Trump promised that he would pass the largest infrastructure bill in U.S. history during his first 100 days in office. More than 500 days into his presidency, the bill still hasn’t even been drafted.” Instead, we’re supposed to fix traffic with techbro scooters at 15 cents a minute.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-electric-scooters-swarming-our-city-wont-solve-our-commuting-calamity/2018/08/27/fb7fbf32-aa12-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html
"Electric Scooter Uptake ‘Quite Remarkable,’ Researcher Says Of Micro-Mobility Data",WAMU,NPR,"Washington, DC",2018,8,28,"Electric Scooter Uptake ‘Quite Remarkable,’ Researcher Says Of Micro-Mobility Data. From Austin to Denver to Cambridge, Massachusetts, dockless electric scooters have hit cities across the country. Earlier this summer, the transportation research firm Populus published data on the rise of micro-mobility. Here & Now’s Peter O’Dowd discusses the so-called “micro-mobility revolution” with Regina Clewlow (@ReginaClewlow), CEO of Populus, and why she thinks electric scooters from companies like Bird are the way of the future. Interview Highlights On why she calls the uptick in dockless electric scooters in major cities a “micro-mobility revolution” “One of the interesting findings from our report is that the adoption of these new services has been quite remarkable in terms of how quickly people have started using them, and in fact, overall adoption of new mobility services is accelerating. “There are interesting network effects. Because so many people are accustomed to using their cell phones to call an Uber or Lyft or now unlock a car-sharing vehicle, the idea of being able to unlock a dockless electric scooter feels quite natural.” On why people dislike the scooters, and a Los Angeles Times report that residents in Venice Beach were setting them on fire and burying them at sea “We found that 70 percent of people in major U.S. cities view [the scooters] positively, so perhaps, you know, those stories represent the 30 percent who don’t. And, what we did find, which was really interesting, is that there is a range of opinions across cities, with San Francisco having the lowest positive perception, but still, 52 percent of people viewed them positively. “I believe a lot of people were caught off guard, so not just cities, but I think that there are actually plenty of people within the private sector, in the investor community, who missed the scooter wave in terms of investment. So, I think a lot of people were caught off guard. “I do also think that part of the narrative or the story is that cities were caught off guard by Uber and Lyft, and so in many ways, this is in part a reaction to the rapid growth of Uber and Lyft and that many cities didn’t actually do anything over many years, and so now that there are smaller devices that are a lot easier to regulate — because you can impound them and collect them much more easily — their cities are reacting much more quickly.” On her experience riding one of the scooters in San Francisco “I rode one in Golden Gate Park … I thought it was great. I would use them on a more regular basis if they were available and if it were safer — if I felt safer riding a bike or a small electric mobility device on the street.”",https://wamu.org/story/18/08/28/electric-scooter-uptake-quite-remarkable-researcher-says-of-micro-mobility-data/
"D.C. allows dockless bikes and scooters to stay, but you’ll have to start locking them up.",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,8,30,"D.C. allows dockless bikes and scooters to stay, but you’ll have to start locking them up. The city will also more clearly define rules for bike and scooter parking. The District Department of Transportation is extending through December the pilot program that allows the operation of dockless bikes and electric scooters. But moving forward, the companies that operate the services will be required to provide a method for users to lock the bikes to racks or poles. The city plans to take the next few months to transition to a more permanent program. DDOT is slated to unveil new regulations next month that will establish operation fees and reassess the existing cap on fleets. The department will also more clearly define rules for bike and scooter parking. The policies will aim to balance the city’s desire for mobility innovation, sustainability goals and public safety. “We think that there’s a viable program to be had,” said Sam Zimbabwe, chief project delivery officer for DDOT. “But we think there needs to be a regulatory framework.” The new regulations should be available for public comment next month and finalized this fall for implementation starting Jan. 1, Zimbabwe said. The rules won’t need to be reviewed or approved by the D.C. Council. The dockless systems, which arrived in the District last September, have become a popular option for getting around. Many commuters have turned to them out of frustration with the region’s troubled public transit system, picking up on the growing trend of using the app-based services for short-distance trips. When the program began last fall, five companies offered dockless bikes and promised to expand bike-sharing and bike commuting. But by spring the program had shifted to mostly electric scooters. Dockless bike operators Mobike and Ofo left the pilot this summer, citing frustration with city's restrictions on fleet size. But they left as scootermania was quickly taking off. Soon scooters became more popular, and profitable, than the dockless bikes. Now most companies operating dockless systems in the city are scooter providers. That includes Bird, Skip, Lime and Spin. The exception is Jump, the Uber-owned company that rents electric bikes. From the day the systems launched in September, through June of this year, users took more than 625,000 rides on the bikes and scooters, according to DDOT. In May alone, more than 55,000 users took over 140,000 trips, the agency said. Each company will continue to be subject to a cap of 400 bikes, scooters or a combination of the two. That restriction may change with the new regulations. Any company operating bikes will be required to have a mechanism for them to be locked to a rack or post. City officials say the requirement is a direct response to complaints from residents and visitors who have encountered bikes blocking pedestrian access. JUMP bikes already have a locking system. DDOT officials said they continue to work with the operators to urge more education about proper bike and scooter parking. The city has added racks to accommodate more than 200 bikes and is on track to add an additional 300 racks this fall, officials said. Moving forward, the city is considering fines on operators to ensure they have incentives in place to encourage users to follow the rules and reduce poor dockless behaviors. The city also wants companies to employ methods to ensure people of all backgrounds can access their services, including those who don’t have credit cards. When asked why it’s taking so long to implement permanent dockless regulations, Zimbabwe said more time was needed to evaluate the program, especially because the arrival of the scooters in February significantly changed the outlook of the dockless services. So far, he said, the services have increased access to personal mobility trips and possibly brought in new users that perhaps weren't using bikes. He said new operation fees would be in line with what other cities have imposed. Earlier this year the District abandoned an unpopular plan to impose a $200-per-bike fee on operators. Seattle this summer approved regulations that allow up to 20,000 bikes — up to 5,000 bikes each to four companies, but with a $250,000 annual fee. Companies that are participating in the program will have to reapply for a permit later this year, Seattle officials said.

Those who dared to try them discovered a whimsical and cheap way to get around. Non-riders saw a swarm of locusts devouring precious inches of sidewalk and street, backed by companies that were the epitome of tech-bro arrogance.

The old-fashioned way Portland is trying to regulate new electric scooters,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,8,31,"The old-fashioned way Portland is trying to regulate new electric scooters. Officials say it’s a low-tech solution to a high-tech problem. The stereotypical electric scooter rider is a tech-savvy millennial on the go, with access to a smartphone and the tolerance for risk that early adopters tend to flaunt. How do you deliver an important message to this information-saturated cohort as they whiz by at the speed of a runner at full sprint? In Portland, Ore., officials from the city's Bureau of Transportation decided the answer was not email alerts, emergency alerts or text notifications. Instead, they've opted for a decidedly low-tech solution, as Willamette Week first reported: Good 'ol paper fliers and rubber bands. Chris Warner, interim director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said the goal of the fliers — thousands of which have been attached to e-scooters all over the city this week — is to remind a growing number of riders to abide by local rules of the road, which include yielding to pedestrians and parking the vehicles with care. ""Fliers are about as old school as you can get — paper and rubber bands,” Warner said. “We're in an era of tremendous innovation in transportation, and that requires a lot of out-of-the-box thinking for private companies, the public and for cities."" ""Sometimes low-tech solutions are the best ones,” he added. Electric scooters hit the streets of Portland last month, the beginning of a 120-day pilot program that aims to monitor the impact of the new vehicles on the city. Since their debut, the city has logged more than 178,000 trips on the vehicles, as well as about 1,100 complaints from about 500 people, according to the PBOT. City officials said the complaints are largely from people reporting riders for doing things like operating scooters without a helmet or riding on the sidewalks, both of which violate state law. Scooter companies such as Bird, Lime and Skip include safety instructions in their apps and on their scooters, but many riders choose to ignore them, according to critics and safety experts. Portland has seen about 12 injuries since the scooters launched, according to the PBOT. Warner said the city started its public education efforts about e-scooters from the first day of the pilot program but turned to fliers in hopes of improving public education following the wave of complaints. In cities across the country, scooter companies such as Bird and Lime have dumped their products on public streets without alerting local officials. In Miami — as in San Francisco, Santa Monica and Austin before it — companies placed e-scooters in the streets and were able to prove that a significant demand for rentals existed before city officials had a chance to remove their vehicles. By creating a base of loyal customers and amassing valuable transportation data, scooter companies gained more leverage before coming to the table to negotiate with city officials. In Portland, city officials closely watched the emergence of e-scooters elsewhere and then launched negotiations with scooter companies before they had a chance to descend on the city preemptively, said Dylan Rivera, a PBOT spokesman. Rivera said Portland officials believe theirs may be the first city to require e-scooter companies to provide real-time data as a condition of city permit approval. The city has repeatedly published that data on its Twitter account and Facebook page Facebook.com/PBOTinfo, an effort that has smoothed the rollout of the sometimes controversial vehicles, officials said. ""Our e-scooter pilot program helps us introduce new technology in a way that puts public safety first,” Warner said. “We require the companies to educate the public on the laws governing e-scooter use. Our data-sharing requirements are among the most comprehensive in the nation, allowing us to monitor the industry for compliance and helping us share information about e-scooter use from week to week during the pilot program.""",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/31/old-fashioned-way-portland-is-trying-regulate-new-electric-scooters/
"With D.C. pilot program extended, dockless company Lime goes all in on scooters",Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2018,8,31,"With D.C. pilot program extended, dockless company Lime goes all in on scooters. That leaves Jump as the only company to provide dockless bike-share bikes in D.C. Lime is pressing the pedal on scooters and will no longer provide shared bikes in D.C., the Washington Times reports. The transition comes as the District continues its pilot program for dockless bikes and scooters until the end of the year, in the hopes of putting long-term rules for the vehicles in place in 2019. A spokesman for the San Francisco-based mobility company told the Times that scooters are more widely used than dockless bikes in D.C. He also said the District’s current cap of 400 vehicles per operator—whether scooters or bikes, or both—is “very, very low” given D.C.’s size, and that a new requirement for dockless bikes to have lock capabilities is not “in line” with Lime’s strategy. A spokeswoman for Lime confirms to Curbed DC that the company will remove its bikes from the city, calling the move a “difficult decision” and adding that Lime is hopeful that District officials will “reconsider the locking requirement.” “While we are thankful that we can continue to offer our scooters in DC, the limited number of vehicles we can provide does not enable us to effectively serve the District,” she says in a statement. Lime is not the only operator to raise concerns about the District’s limit on the number of dockless vehicles allowed under the pilot program, which officials announced they were extending on Thursday. In a statement yesterday, Uber-owned Jump, which deploys 400 electric bikes in D.C., said it is “working hard to keep up with demand.” With the departure of Lime’s bikes, Jump is the only dockless company to provide bikes in D.C. Theirs come with pedal-assist and locking technology, so they satisfy the District’s new locking rule. Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Spin also said it would pivot to an all e-scooter fleet in D.C. And in July, China-based operators Ofo and Mobike exited from the city. From last September—when the pilot program launched—to June, D.C. recorded more than 625,000 rides on dockless vehicles, according to the District Department of Transportation.

"Scooter rider fatally struck by SUV in Dupont Circle, officials say",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,9,21,"Scooter rider fatally struck by SUV in Dupont Circle, officials say. A man riding an electric scooter was killed Friday morning in a collision with an SUV at Dupont Circle in what officials believe is the District’s first fatality involving a rider of a shared scooter service. The rider, identified as Carlos Sanchez-Martin, 20, of Silver Spring, was dragged about 20 yards, according to a witness, and pinned under the silver SUV. The distinctive Lime scooter, a shoe and a pair of headphones were left in the roadway. Firefighters had to extricate the man from underneath the SUV. Police said Sanchez-Martin died at a hospital shortly after the 10 a.m. incident. The driver of the SUV remained at the scene, and police were investigating the cause. No charges have been filed. Lime is among three businesses that offer the two-wheeled vehicles for rent in D.C. in a program similar to a bike-share. Terry Owens, a spokesman for the D.C. Department of Transportation, said this was the city’s first fatality involving a shared scooter since the services started this spring. A spokesperson for Lime said in a statement the company is “deeply saddened to hear the report of this incident in Washington, D.C. Our thoughts and sympathies are with the family and loved ones. We have offered our full support to local authorities in connection with the investigation.” Scooters have become a popular option for getting around in the District and many other cities. Commuters have turned to them out of frustration with the region’s public transit system, picking up on the growing trend of using the app-based services for short-distance trips. But with that popularity has also come safety concerns. Authorities in Dallas said this week a 24-year-old man died after falling off a Lime electric scooter on Sept. 1 and suffering head injuries. At the time, three main shared scooter companies said they were not aware of any previous deaths involving their devices. Police kept a portion of the traffic circle, one of the District’s busiest and most complex closed into Friday afternoon. Police said they have not yet determined who was at fault. Janelle Rhorer was commuting to her Dupont Circle office and was at a stop light two vehicles behind where the crash occurred. She was on Massachusetts Avenue preparing to enter the inner part of the circle, and her line of vehicles had a red light. Rhorer, 45, said the scooter was headed out of the park at the circle and was on a crosswalk when it was struck. She could not see if the scooter operator had a green or red light, or a pedestrian walking light. “It was so awful,” Rhoher said, adding the SUV stopped about 20 yards from impact, and she could see the victim trapped underneath. Rhoher said she frequently encounters the rented scooters and other types of scooters in the District. “They just emerged as popular,” she said, “and I think that how to handle them with all the traffic probably needs looking at.” Scooter operations are being allowed in the city as part of the District’s exploration of new mobility services. In September, the city opened its doors to five dockless bike systems. Three shared scooter companies operate in D.C. — Lime, Bird and Skip. The scooter services can rent up to 400 scooters each. From the day the systems launched in September, through June of this year, users took more than 625,000 rides on the bikes and scooters, according to the D.C. Department of Transportation, which last month extended the pilot program through the end of the year. The electric scooters are allowed in bike lanes but prohibited on sidewalks downtown, per city law. Users are not required to wear a helmet in the District, but scooter companies encourage users to take precautions and avoid using headphones or carrying anything in their hands during a ride. The Lime scooters go nearly 15 mph and have a 37-mile maximum range. The scooter companies have said safety is a top priority. Bird, Lime and Skip have basic safety information on their apps and labels on their scooters, as well as training instructions. Bird requires users to upload a driver’s license and confirm they are at least 18 years old. Some of the companies say they give away free helmets. The scooter systems have not been without controversy, having raised concerns about people riding on sidewalks and without helmets. In interviews with The Washington Post this summer, emergency-room physicians in seven cities, including Austin, Atlanta and Nashville, reported a spike in severe accidents after the scooters launched on their streets. Reports of incidents, including of broken noses, wrists and shoulders and facial lacerations and fractures, have been reported, according to a news report this month. In the District, Friday’s scooter fatality came as traffic deaths are on an upward trend. As of Friday, the city had recorded 26 fatalities, two more than the same time last year, according to police. Three were bicyclists and ten were pedestrians. Five were motorcyclists, seven were in cars and was riding an ATV. The numbers include the scooter fatality; it is classified as a pedestrian crash.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/emergency-workers-try-to-rescue-pedestrian-trapped-under-suv-in-dupont-circle/2018/09/21/aec71252-bdaa-11e8-be70-52bd11fe18af_story.html
‘No Scooter Zone' Sign Spotted at GMU in Arlington,NBC Washington,NBC,"Washington, DC",2018,10,3,"‘No Scooter Zone' Sign Spotted at GMU in Arlington. George Mason University is revising its policy on electric scooters on its Arlington campus after initially posting ""no scooter zone"" signs. Electric motor scooters like those operated by the companies Lime and Bird popped up around the District less than a year ago and their popularity is rising. With a $1 fee to use them and prorated rates based on time used, electric scooters offer a quick and affordable way to navigate city streets. However, critics have noted concerns with etiquette after scooters started appearing in pedestrian walkways at George Mason University's campus in Arlington, Virginia. Buzz McClain, a GMU spokesperson, said students were repeatedly leaving scooters at the front of the school's main building, leading to a sign reading ""No Scooter Zone, All Scooters Must Be Parked At Bike Rack."" ""It says over and over again, do not do this, do not do that. And the last message is, 'do not leave this in the middle of a sidewalk,"" McClain said. But the school recognizes the popularity of the scooters, so it is softening the message, McClain said. ""I think the 'no scooter zone' sign got the attention of a lot of people, a little exclamatory. So we're gonna tone down the messaging and say, 'park the scooters over by the bikes,' and that's it."" Some GMU students said scooters are popular and shouldn't be banned,. ""I think it would probably hurt the numberof applicants that they would get to the school itself,"" Taylor Manley said.

Her scooter was a blast — until she broke her leg,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,10,3,"Her scooter was a blast — until she broke her leg. While Adoria Doucette recuperates, she says it’s time D.C. does more to protect riders and pedestrians. Adoria Doucette loved zipping around downtown Washington on an electric scooter. Then she crashed. Now Doucette, who suffered a severe leg injury when her scooter collided with a bicycle this summer, thinks the city government should do more to protect scooter riders and pedestrians as the devices grow in popularity. In an appearance before the D.C. Council last week, she said if the city can’t force companies to make them safe, then the city should ban them. “My biggest concern are the children I see in every neighborhood riding these,” Doucette said. “They could die or lose a limb, like I almost did.” Doucette, who lives in Washington, was one of several people who urged to city to step up its campaign on traffic safety and criticized the lack of progress despite its commitment to Vision Zero, an initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities by 2024. Some witnesses said the city wasn’t aggressively enforcing traffic laws already on the books, while others said the city was moving too slowly to install bike- and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Others warned that the proliferation of e-scooters was asking for trouble. “Everywhere I go, I hear from my constituents about scooters,” council member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) said, adding that he had almost been hit by one while he was jogging. “It’s really chaotic out there.” Doucette said she saw that kind of chaos firsthand (and, police say, contributed to it by violating a traffic law) the day her scooter crashed. In an interview after her testimony, Doucette said her 14-year-old daughter persuaded her to try the gadgets out because she wanted to do something fun to celebrate her stellar academic performance in school. So Doucette found herself scooting around downtown with her daughter on July 7 and enjoying the ride, despite some apprehensiveness about their safety. When Doucette made a right onto U Street off 16th Street NW, however, she ran into trouble. She said a delivery van was illegally parked at the curb but protruding into the bike lane, obstructing her view. A bicyclist was pedaling the wrong way up the bike path. And then, she said, she found out the brake on her Lime scooter wasn’t working. “All I could do was scream out, ‘My brake’s not working!’ ” she recalled. District police declined to release the accident report, offering only a brief narrative of the crash that occurred about 2 p.m. that day: “The rider of the scooter took a right turn on red at the intersection and collided with the bicycle.” Police also confirmed that Doucette received a citation for violating the right-on-red law. The impact from the crash opened a gash in her left leg, crushed the kneecap and fractured the bone, requiring emergency surgery at the hospital. Doctors had to stitch the bone together with metal pins and use about 30 staples to close the wound. She’s likely to be on crutches at least until Thanksgiving, maybe Christmas. She was using crutches Thursday when she, along with several other advocates for bicyclists and pedestrians, urged the council to do better on traffic safety, particularly by cracking down on scooters. “I feel the District has a responsibility to make sure Lime scooter is regulated in a way that doesn’t hurt anybody,” Doucette said in an interview following her testimony. A spokesman for Lime, which is one of several e-scooter businesses operating in Washington, did not respond to an email seeking comment. Doucette, a writer who has written for Washington Life Magazine’s Power Source, denied going right on red, as police allege. She also criticized what she said was rude treatment by the police officer who responded to the crash. She said the officer followed her to the hospital and wrote her a ticket for turning right on right where such a maneuver is prohibited. Meanwhile, Doucette said the pain from her accident is still intense and has kept her from being able to do even the simplest things, such as taking her daughter shopping for the new school year. Just bending her leg causes pain, and she may need more surgery, she said. “[I] really want people to know how dangerous these things are,” she said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2018/10/03/her-scooter-was-blast-until-she-broke-her-leg/
Injuries waiting to happen or a good time? Just how safe are dockless scooters?,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2018,10,10,"Injuries waiting to happen or a good time? Just how safe are dockless scooters? When Andie Vaught rolled over a pothole while riding a Lime electric scooter, she had no idea what hit her. The 27-year-old was zipping through a bike lane near 13th Street and Massachusetts Avenue in Northwest D.C. and went flying sideways into a utility truck before slamming down onto the road. “It was a really jarring experience,” Vaught said. “I was really confused and shocked that suddenly, I was on the ground.” After spending two days in the hospital, Vaught learned that her left ankle was dislocated and fractured, and her ACL was partially torn. The accident happened in July, but she is still nowhere near 100 percent recovered. “I have a plate and screws and a suture to hold everything in place,” Vaught said. “My left leg really took the brunt of the impact.” Though Vaught’s injuries are serious, they are not unusual among riders who fall while using dockless electric scooters made by companies such as Lime, Bird and Skip. The scooters have two small wheels and can get up to around 15 mph. According to the American College of Emergency Physicians, major cities across the country have reported increased traffic in emergency rooms due to fractures, dislocations and head injuries. “These are really injuries waiting to happen,” said Dr. Robert Shesser, who chairs the Department of Emergency Medicine at George Washington University. “It would appear that they’re too fast for the sidewalk and too slow for the street.” D.C. has seen a “large number of upper extremity injuries” since the scooters arrived in the city, according to Shesser. In September, a 20-year-old Lime scooter rider died when he was hit and dragged by an SUV in the Dupont Circle area. “Streets and sidewalks were not designed with these types of vehicles in mind,” Shesser said. “It certainly has a greater risk of injury than the bicycles that you can rent.” Companies that make the scooters urge their riders to wear helmets. They also include basic safety instructions and advice on their apps and websites. In a statement to WTOP, a spokesperson for Lime said, “All first time Lime riders are required to complete an in-app tutorial that provides guidelines on helmet safety, and we will continue to implement tools like this.” But, many communities are still determining whether scooters are safe enough to remain on the streets. “We’re working very closely with other cities to see what has worked and what hasn’t worked,” said Jeff Marootian, director of the District Department of Transportation. “We’ve taken a fairly incremental approach to allowing them to operate with a permit and, certainly, are continuing to evaluate.” As D.C. leaders ponder the scooter safety question, Vaught has her answer. She can’t see herself ever stepping on a scooter again. “Our infrastructure really isn’t meant for the scooters, and they’re so new that people aren’t used to them,” Vaught said. “I’m not sure that the city really is prepared.”",https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/10/suddenly-i-was-on-the-ground-injuries-on-dockless-scooters-examined/
Lyft Becomes The Latest Company To Invest in D.C.’s Dockless Scooter Market,WAMU,NPR,"Washington, DC",2018,10,18,"Lyft Becomes The Latest Company To Invest in D.C.’s Dockless Scooter Market. The scooter market has come a long way from the early 2000s, when Razor scooters took the country by tiny, two-wheeled storm. While the foldable kick scooter was largely thought of as a toy (it was even named a “toy of the year” in 2001), their motorized cousins are now being taken very seriously as a part of our transportation future. Ridehailing company Lyft is the latest firm to get in on the rentable scooter game, launching a fleet of black-and-pink scooters in D.C. on Thursday. “Part of the reason we’re so excited about this is it fits into our vision of a multimodal transportation future, where you can use Lyft as kind of a one-stop shop for all your transportation needs,” says Chris Dattaro, Lyft’s market manager for bikes and scooters in D.C. “So if you need a car, we’ll have a ridesharing app. If you need to go just a short distance, we’ll have scooters.” Dattaro says that the company will also have bikes “in the near future.” Lyft acquired Motivate, which operates Capital Bikeshare, in June. The company’s founders have laid out an expansive vision for both scooters and bicycles, part of what they say is “a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the private and public sectors to work together to make our cities designed for people not cars.” Meanwhile, competitor Uber has invested in Lime, a company that rents both scooters and bicycles, and it also owns electric bike company Jump, which recently rolled out its first fleet of scooters in Santa Monica, California. Lyft’s scooters cost $1 to start, plus an additional 15 cents per mile. The new option now shows up in the regular app (would-be scooters riders will need to use the most up-to-date version of the app). Scooter rides of two or three miles will likely be cheaper than taking a ridehailing vehicle, according to Dattaro. He estimates that a trip from Union Station to Logan Circle would cost somewhere from $10-12 in a car or $3-4 on a scooter. D.C. is the third place that the company has launched its scooter program, following roll-outs in Denver and Santa Monica in recent weeks. In the District, Lyft is taking part in the same pilot program that has brought various fleets of electric scooters and dockless bikes to the city’s streets. Under rules set by the D.C. Department of Transportation, each company can have up to 400 dockless vehicles of any kind. While the program launched entirely with fleets of bicycles last fall, only Jump’s electric bikes remain. Meanwhile, new scooter options have been mushrooming over the past few months. Washingtonians can currently jump on the motorized devices from Lime, Bird, Spin and now Lyft. While there has been grumbling about scooters whizzing by on busy sidewalks, the majority of D.C. residents have a positive view of the devices, according to a survey released by transportation data company Populus over the summer. There are also concerns about safety, however. Last month, a 20-year-old man died after being hit by a SUV driver in Dupont Circle, the first fatality involving a rented scooter in the District since the program began. The pilot period, during which city officials are studying the implementation of dockless vehicles and designing rules for safe use, has been extended three times. DDOT aims to have a permanent program in place next year to accommodate the continued demand for the program.

"Scooters are taking cars off the road, a survey says",Greater Greater Washington,,"Washington, DC",2018,10,25,"Scooters are taking cars off the road, a survey says. For DC and other cities concerned about rising traffic, a new study in Portland, Oregon suggests scooters could be a solution. Residents and tourists are using e-scooters in place of car trips, and scooters are drawing people who've never ridden a bike or never traveled in a bike lane. The Portland Bureau of Transportation sent a questionnaire to 75,000 scooter users and received 4,500 responses. Among the findings, reported by BikePortland: E-scooters are replacing automobile trips. Thinking of their last e-scooter trip, 34 percent of Portlanders said they would have driven a personal car (19 percent) or hailed a taxi, Uber or Lyft (15 percent). The auto trip replacement numbers are even higher among tourists and visitors (48 percent). Thinking of their last e-scooter trip, 34 percent of visitors would have taken a taxi, Uber or Lyft, and 14 percent would have driven a personal vehicle had e-scooters not been available. E-scooters are bringing new Portlanders to the bike lane. Forty-five percent of survey respondents reported “never” biking and 78 percent had never used BIKETOWN prior to using e-scooters. Portlanders are reducing or considering reducing their auto ownership due to e-scooters. Six percent of users report getting rid of a car because of e-scooters and another 16 percent have considered it. The Portland study also said respondents preferred to ride in a bike lane, followed by the street and finally sidewalk as the last choice. In cities including DC which have e-scooters, whether to ride on the sidewalk or in the street has been a subject of debate. Bike advocates point out that the clear answer is to have a comprehensive network of bike lanes, where scooters have so far coexisted well, so that people don't have to ride in a street with fast-moving cars or on a sidewalk except for very short distances. DC continues to limit dockless bike and scooter companies to 400 vehicles per company, a number spokespeople for the companies have said is much too low and doesn't meet the demand. In September, Arlington decided to institute a flexible cap, where each company could deploy 350 to start, but increase by 50 per month as long as their bikes or scooters were drawing three or more rides per day on average. Montgomery County did not cap numbers but limited its pilot to three non-electric dockless bike companies in Silver Spring; it's now considering a larger zone and allowing e-bikes and scooters. This particular study looked at scooters, but an earlier Uber analysis found similar effects. Uber users who started riding JUMP (which Uber owns) decreased their Uber usage by 10% and 15% during work days, but Uber actually sold them 15% more trips because their new JUMP trips made up for it and then some. For DC residents, it's not too late to sign the letter calling for 20,000 shared bikes and scooters (Capital Bikeshare and dockless) which we created with WABA, CSG, the Sierra Club, and other organizations.",https://ggwash.org/view/69621/scooters-are-taking-cars-off-the-road-a-survey-says
"DC Dockless scooters and bikes will have to cap speeds, offer payment options",Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2018,11,5,"DC Dockless scooters and bikes will have to cap speeds, offer payment options. The District’s yearlong pilot program with dockless bike and scooter companies will become a permanent option for D.C. commuters in 2019, with new rules now set in stone for the companies that want to provide their vehicles in the District. Among new requirements, scooters and motorized bicycles will have to be equipped with speed governors that restrict the vehicles maximum speed to 10 mph for electric scooters and 20 mph for electric bikes. Companies will also be required to provide non-smartphone options for trip rentals, cash-payment options and low income pricing. And the number of vehicles each company will be allowed to operate will be capped at 600, but no fewer than 100. Companies renting both dockless bikes and scooters will be issued separate permits for each fleet. “The new dockless permit requirements reflect the promise DDOT sees in this program to increase active transportation in the District, as well as the many valid concerns we heard from a wide range of stakeholders involving safety and equity,” said District Department of Transportation director Jeff Marootian. The first round of permits issued will be valid from January 1 to December 31.2019. Dockless companies that are awarded permits for next year and that want to increase their permitted fleet size will be required to achieve a favorable quarterly evaluation from DDOT, and fleets can be increased by no more than 25 percent for each request. The District also wants dockless companies to address people with disabilities and low income residents. While not required, the new rules encourage dockless companies to provide adaptive vehicles for people with disabilities. Those vehicles would not count toward the maximum number allowed. And it will require payment options that don’t require a smartphone for trip rentals, cash-payment options and low-income pricing plans. The companies will also have to deploy their scooters and bikes in all 8 wards in the District. Permit fees will be based on fleet size, but also require a $10,000 performance bond, money which the District will use to pay for the removal or impounding unsafe or abandoned vehicles. The District also wants to know where dockless commuters are going, requiring monthly, anonymous trip data for program evaluation, including number of rides, safety incidents, improper parking and repairs. Five private dockless companies currently operate in the District. Jump has a fleet of dockless bicycles only. Skip, Bird, Lime and Lyft all operate electric scooters. Spin, which launched as a dockless bike company, plans to convert to a scooter fleet. Information on the 2019 dockless applications is posted on DDOT’s website. The private dockless bike and scooter companies are unrelated to D.C.’s Capital Bikeshare program, which uses dozens of stationary docks throughout the District.",https://wtop.com/business-finance/2018/11/dockless-scooters-and-bikes-in-dc-will-have-to-cap-speeds-offer-payment-options/
"DC will allow more dockless bikes and scooters, but v-e-e-r-y s-l-o-o-o-w-l-y",Greater Greater Washington,,"Washington, DC",2018,11,6,"DC will allow more dockless bikes and scooters, but v-e-e-r-y s-l-o-o-o-w-l-y. The DC government has twice extended an initial pilot program for dockless bikes and scooters without changing any of its initial rules, including a limit of 400 vehicles per company which we've argued was too restrictive. Now, for 2019, there's a new version of program with some more flexibility, but also many new rules. On the cap, DC will now allow 600 bikes or scooters per company, up from 400. For companies that offer both, they will be able to treat bikes and scooters totally separately, with up to 600 for each. Further, if things are going smoothly, the District Department of Transportation will be able to grant an increase of 25% every three months. Bikes will have to include locks which let them be connected to a rack or sign, like the current JUMP bikes do. JUMP is the only service offering dockless bikes in DC right now. Scooters won't need locks, but will have to contain technology limiting them to 10 mph, while e-bikes must be limited to 20 mph (possibly more downhill, obviously, but the motor won't drive it faster). Companies will pay fees that amount to about $5 per month for each bike or scooter, plus annual fees that amount to about $500. They will also have to post a $10,000 bond against problems or companies abandoning the market and not cleaning up their vehicles. Services have to offer ways for people to rent vehicles without a smartphone, and pay cash. They have to provide lower prices to low-income residents including “unlimited trips under 30 minutes to any customer with an income level at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines,” and put vehicles in all eight wards by 6:00 each morning. There has to be a public web service so smartphone apps and web tools and researchers can access information on bike and scooter locations, so, for instance, apps like Transit can show you where to get dockless vehicles. DDOT will get more detailed data including the start and end time and location of every trip, how long bikes or scooters are in service, and more. You can read the detailed scooter terms and bicycle terms yourself for more information. “Why are we taxing and regulating it as if it's a nuisance?” Our contributors generally feel dockless bikes and scooters represent a huge opportunity to help more people get around without driving, in a way that takes up less street space and pollutes the air less. As one contributor put it, “If dockless mobility is something we want, why are we taxing and regulating it as if it's a nuisance?” Contributors were most frustrated by the continued low limits. “We wanted 20,000 right? This is like 15% of that? I don't think the other regs matter that much. This is setting this up to fail,” said Nick Sementelli. David Cranor said, “Not so long ago we had 2,000 dockless bikes. Why can't we start there at least?” The split 600-and-600 will let companies that currently offer just one vehicle branch out into the other. Some companies only want to offer scooters right now because they make more money than non-electric bikes. All non-electric dockless bike companies have left the DC market. Some, like Mobike and ofo, loudly proclaimed that they were leaving because of the 400-vehicle cap, though those companies, both based in China, also pulled out of North America entirely and weren't very good at cooperating with rules. However, Tracy Loh pointed out, there are still companies offering bikes in other cities. While JUMP offers the lock-to requirement, other companies do not currently. One contributor, who couldn't speak on the record because they are not allowed to be quoted on this topic due to their job, said that at least one company would bring e-bikes into DC but can't meet the lock-to rule. Also, they added, there are still not enough bike racks in most areas of the city. Other contributors argued that lock-to makes sense as a way to stop problematic parking jobs that generate complaints from residents. Certainly it's true that since non-locking bikes left the DC market, dockless bike parking has just not been a problem the way it was last fall. DC is holding bikes and scooters to a higher standard than cars Some contributors critcized the overall policy framework which puts so many rules on bikes. Gordon Chaffin wrote, “There is no cap on cars that come in, come out, or stay in DC permanently with residents. Unless we apply some similar logic to cars, there will be tryanny of the automobile in DC.” Dan Malouff added, “while I can see the logic behind wanting to regulate companies like this, unless we regulate Uber and Lyft with similar provisions, we are absolutely exacerbating systemic biases towards car use.” Uber and Lyft now in fact operate dockless vehicles (Uber owns JUMP, and Lyft just launched scooters in DC) as well as their traditional car ride-hailing services, so DC's regulations are putting more of an onus on their sustainable bike-and-scooter services than the car ones. DDOT would probably like to regulate the cars more as well, but can't because those rules are written into legislation. Similarly, there are rules I know officials would like to set up about private cars, except that's a much harder task. But this is the point contributors are making. Government officials can regulate this new technology heavily because it's new and doesn't have the kind of base that driving does. But this new technology is also something we should want to encourage to grow quickly, to let people get around without driving if they choose. We know people are choosing this, but often can't because vehicles are not available. The bigger public policy picture is still getting lost here. He added, “Now we're going to 'learn' the lesson when it comes to dockless and more aggressively regulate. But why?” And more Lime has been offering a cash payment option in Seattle, and Spin and JUMP have similar programs. The new cash payment rules seem modeled on that. A rebalancing rule is something I've suggested for some time. But, letting companies put enough vehicles on the street to meet demand will make it a lot easier to have some of them in underserved areas. And, companies can make enough money to pay for rebalancers, cash payment programs, and more. Equity regulations make the most sense in the context of a larger program, like Seattle's which allows 5,000 vehicles per company. I haven't gotten through all of the data sharing requirements, but requiring public APIs is an important practice which I've been pushing for since the beginning. The Transit app folks just published an article about the importance of open data in dockless services, and called out DC as a leader in this regard. What do you think? DDOT is accepting comments until November 26. You can use the form below to submit your thoughts.

D.C. to expand the number of scooters and dockless bikes allowed in 2019,Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2018,11,9,"D.C. to expand the number of scooters and dockless bikes allowed in 2019. But advocates and mobility companies cast the move as tepid. Residents will probably notice more scooters and dockless bikes on D.C.’s streets next year thanks to updated rules for the vehicles that transportation officials announced this week. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) says in 2019 it will permit companies to each operate up to 600 dockless vehicles per type of vehicle, and to grow their fleets by 25 percent each quarter at the agency’s discretion. A company could offer up to 1,200 to start. Currently, companies are individually allowed to operate up to 400 vehicles total under a pilot program. Five operators are participating: Skip, Bird, Lime, Lyft, and Jump. Uber owns Jump, which is the only operator that provides a full electric-bike fleet. The other operators predominately offer scooters, with Lyft joining the pack last month. (A sixth company, Spin, started out with dockless bikes, but announced it would shift to scooters. Lime did as well.) The new rules are set to take effect in January. In instructions for applying for 2019 permits, DDOT says it “will reward reasonably good stewardship of public space, vehicle safety and maintenance, and adherence to data sharing conditions.” The instructions also outline fees for operating dockless vehicles in D.C. that will be higher toward the beginning of the year. Additionally, operators will also be required to pay annual permit fees and $10,000 bonds to DDOT for moving dockless vehicles “that are parked illegally or have otherwise remained an obstruction in the public right of way.” DDOT says the yearly $10,000 bonds are refundable, and that companies must request separate permits to operate dockless bikes and scooters. Other rules for mobility companies include deploying a minimum of 100 vehicles across all eight wards of the city by 6 a.m. each day, restricting scooter and electric-bike speeds to 10 mph and 20 mph, respectively, and providing the District “anonymous trip data for planning purposes and program evaluation,” per a release. All dockless bikes must be equipped with locking mechanisms so they can be parked on posts and racks. (Jump bikes already feature this capability.) Officials are also encouraging adaptive vehicles for people with disabilities. In a statement, DDOT Director Jeff Marootian says the new requirements aim to balance the mobility benefits of dockless vehicles against the community’s “many valid concerns” about “safety and equity.” People have taken more than 940,000 rides on scooters and dockless since they débuted in the District in September 2017. Recently, a driver struck and killed a man who was riding a scooter in Dupont Circle—one of 31 traffic fatalities in D.C. this year. Despite the planned expansion of the dockless vehicle program, some mobility companies and advocates say the District could be much more welcoming to non-car modes of transit. Over the summer, a coalition of nonprofit groups called for 20,000 dockless vehicles in D.C., and operators have said they are not completely meeting demand because of the current cap. “The proposed vehicle fleet of 600 vehicles [per company] is simply not enough to meet the city’s transportation needs,” a spokeswoman for Lime told the Washington Post after DDOT unveiled the new requirements on Monday. She added that the cap needs to be “significantly increased” for the company to “reliably and equitably” serve people throughout the District. Operators have until Nov. 19 to submit dockless vehicle permit applications to DDOT. Residents may also comment on proposed regulations for the vehicles until Nov. 26. This post has been updated to clarify that the 600 vehicle limit applies to type of vehicle.",https://dc.curbed.com/2018/11/9/18076394/dc-scooters-dockless-bikes-transportation-cycling-ddot
Alexandria set to allow dockless bikeshare and scooters,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2018,11,11,"Alexandria set to allow dockless bikeshare and scooters. Alexandria is set to allow dockless bike-share and scooters under a program that would mirror neighboring Arlington County’s pilot. Alexandria’s City Council is due to take up the pilot program Tuesday. Officially, the dockless bikes and scooters are not currently allowed to be left or picked up in Alexandria on any public property, but they have been appearing in the city since people can pick them up in Arlington, D.C. and Montgomery County. Arlington adopted rules for its pilot program effective Oct. 1 only after a company tried a guerrilla launch there. Two companies have officially reached agreements with Arlington so far. Alexandria city staff believe the close-knit nature of Arlington and Alexandria neighborhoods makes similar rules the best bet. A presentation set to be given to the Alexandria City Council on Tuesday night outlines plans for a nine-month pilot program that would match Arlington’s beginning as soon as this month. The council would then decide on final rules next fall if Virginia’s General Assembly does not intervene this winter. The Alexandria program would require companies to encourage users to ride scooters on streets rather than sidewalks until Alexandria decides whether to make riding the scooters on sidewalks illegal. It would also require the companies work on something in their app that could ensure the bikes or scooters are parked properly, and Old Town Clean Team staff would be allowed to clear pedestrian paths or report issues to the companies. The District recently adopted final rules after many months of delays, and is accepting applications from companies for next year’s permits. Alexandria would charge a one-time $5,000 permit fee to each company to cover the entire pilot period, limit each company to no more than 200 total bikes and scooters unless ridership spikes, require the companies to communicate parking and use rules, and set up ways for city residents to report any problems. The dockless vehicles will not be permitted to be left anywhere that blocks a sidewalk, driveway, fire hydrant or bus stop. In Alexandria, regular bikes are allowed on streets, trails and sidewalks (except the sidewalks on parts of King and Union St. in Old Town). Electric pedal assist bikes are allowed to ride on streets and sidewalks where other bikes are permitted and on trails other than the Mt.

Bird’s plea to Mayor Bowser: Allow more scooters and don’t make us slow down,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,11,14,"Bird’s plea to Mayor Bowser: Allow more scooters and don’t make us slow down. New D.C. regulations go against the city’s sustainability goals, the scooter company says. Bird, one of the nation’s largest providers of shared scooters, is making the case to D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) that capping fleet sizes is counterproductive to her sustainability goals. The District last week unveiled new regulations that limit scooter services to a maximum of 600 vehicles and require them to deploy scooters with capability for a maximum speed of 10 mph. Under rules set to go into effect in January, e-scooter companies also will need to offer a cash payment option to customers and pay fees to the city. “The regulations are antithetical to Washington D.C.’s climate plan, and its long-standing history as a leader in sustainability,” David Estrada, head of government partnerships at Bird, said in a letter to Bowser this week. “While the city works to make progress toward meeting its ambitious goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by the year 2032, it threatens to advance a set of policies that stifle solutions that have proven to be helpful in achieving that goal.” Scooters are one of the solutions to taking vehicles off the road because they can replace cars for short trips, he said. Estrada wrote that more than 580,000 miles have been ridden on Bird scooters since they arrived in the District six months ago, which “helped the city avoid over 516,000 pounds of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere had those trips been otherwise taken by car.” In announcing the new regulations last week, the District Department of Transportation said the requirements signal Bowser’s commitment to “fostering innovation” and delivering “the safest, most sustainable, and most efficient transportation options to District residents and visitors.” Bowser’s office responded to Bird’s letter with a statement late Tuesday that said the program “is expanding in a way that addresses the needs of users and the concerns of residents"" and said her administration “is committed to embracing technology that provides more transportation options that reduce the impact of emissions on our environment.” The city is allowing the companies to increase the number of scooters in their fleet to 600 from 400. The companies can then request their fleet be increased up to 25 percent after an evaluation by DDOT. Companies that meet performance measures, and maintain safe and quality operations, could be operating up to 1,200 scooters in the city by the end of 2019. “We think that is a fairly substantial expansion,” said Sam Zimbabwe, a top DDOT official who has been overseeing the program. He said he understands the companies' position to want the fleet cap removed, but he said the city’s approach responds to both their calls for expansion and residents' concerns about safe operations. DDOT also wants to keep the program competitive, he said, to allow more companies to enter the market rather than limit the number of providers with an expanded fleet size. “We are committed to making this program work,” Zimbabwe said. In addition to Bird, three other companies — Lime, Skip and Lyft — also operate in the city. Spin plans to launch its scooter services in D.C. after suspending its bike-share operations this summer. JUMP operates electric bikes. A survey of Bird riders in the District found that nearly 90 percent use Bird to get to work, run errands or commute to school. And about one of every four users rides scooters to connect to public transit. A great majority of users — 90 percent — said they want more Birds on the road, Estrada said. Scooter companies have been lobbying the city to eliminate the fleet cap. Some say a city like Washington could need as many as 20,000 scooters and dockless bikes to serve all eight wards. ""The Department of Transportation’s proposed cap on e-scooters available to the people of D.C. eliminates any chance of this program being equitable, of solving issues related to transportation deserts in the city, and ultimately of getting more cars off the road,” Estrada said in his letter. “Critical to a successful e-scooter share program is convenience and accessibility.” Capping the size leaves e-scooter providers little incentive to spread their fleet outside the most popular, high-density areas. The city’s regulations, which also apply to bike-share providers, will require companies to have scooters and bikes in all wards of the city. But they will only be required to have at least six vehicles in each ward, which means companies are still unlikely to deploy significantly more vehicles to underserved areas east of the Anacostia River. Bird also protested DDOT’s requirement that companies deploy scooters capable of reaching speeds no higher than 10 mph, while e-bikes can go up to 20 mph, saying the policy ignores research about e-scooter and bike safety that suggests a disparity in speed between vehicles using the same shared infrastructure will make the roads more dangerous. “Vehicles traveling at significantly different speeds will create dangerous conditions, and could increase opportunity for collisions between cars, e-scooters, and bikes,” Estrada said. And, he said, there is no data to suggest that 10 mph is safer for e-scooter riders than 15 mph. “We hope that you will consider intervening in the current process and work with us on defining a more practical solution to improving mobility options in the District,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2018/11/14/birds-plea-mayor-bowser-allow-more-scooters-dont-make-us-slow-down/
Lyft offers a low-income discount on scooters in DC. It also lobbied against a tax to fund shelter beds in San Francisco.,Street Sense Media,,"Washington, DC",2018,11,14,"Lyft offers a low-income discount on scooters in DC. It also lobbied against a tax to fund shelter beds in San Francisco. Lyft recently added 250 scooters to D.C. streets and plans to bring the number up to 400 in the near future. This addition brings the district’s dockless scooter count up to 2,000. While the scooters cost $1 to unlock and an additional 15 cents per minute of use, Lyft is offering a cheaper option for low-income residents. For just $5 per month, residents who can show proof of government financial assistance can receive unlimited rides of 30 minutes or less on Lyft scooters. With rising Metro costs and data suggests longer Metro wait times for poorer neighborhoods, scooters are an attractive option. The Lyft “Community Pass” program launched last month and is available to area residents over age 18. Residents can apply online by entering their information and uploading a photo of a document that proves they qualify for a federal or state assistance program, such as Medicaid, SNAP, or a discounted utility bill. Lyft is the first brand of scooter in D.C. to offer this type of program. “Access to transportation is an everyday necessity,” Lyft says on its website. “These emissions-free modes of transportation offer a greener alternative to car ownership or ridesharing.” Similar low-income options are offered by competing dockless vehicle companies Bird, Lime, Skip and Spin, according to a spokesperson for the D.C. Department of Transportation. However, the low-income programs for Skip and Spin are not yet available in the District. WMATA offers reduced fares for certain populations, but not every low-income resident can qualify. Those with disabilities, a Medicare ID, a government-issued photo ID, elderly residents, and students from ages 5 to 21 can ride the Metro at discounted rates or even free fares in the case of elementary and high school students. The Lyft scooter would provide a cheaper method of transportation for those who don’t qualify for reduced fares and who are physically able to ride. A blue and red map highlighting that jobs are most accessible to people who are reliant on public transportation in the core of the city. Last year, Metro fares increased with a 10-cent hike on peak fares and a 25-cent hike on off-peak fares. Researchers at the Washington Post also found transit times were longer in low-income areas, despite shorter distances from inner D.C. For instance, residents in Gaithersburg or Bethesda, 20 miles outside of city limits, can make it to the White House in about an hour using public transit, whereas residents much closer in areas just across the Anacostia River or in the southernmost tip of the District have a commute just as long despite being 13 miles closer. According to districtmobility.org, Ward 8 residents have some of the longest transit times — roughly 46 minutes to the White House. According to Google Maps, this is longer than it would take to bike there. The drive time from the Ward 8 Farmers Market to the White House is only 26 minutes, in heavy traffic. While Lyft’s scooter program provides an alternative for low-income residents, in San Francisco, Lyft just spent $100,000 to oppose a ballot initiative that would tax corporations with gross receipts more than $50 million (roughly .5 percent more) to fund 4,000 beds for homeless residents in the city. Tech companies have mixed positions on Prop. C; Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff came out in support of the initiative, while Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is spending money to topple it. Because of Lyft’s opposition to Prop. C, some San Francisco residents are boycotting Lyft, once thought of as the more ethical rideshare app compared to Uber. Prop C passed overwhelmingly, but the city has put spending on hold until legal disputes around the vote are settled. According to the San Francisco Examiner, Lyft has responded saying “We support Mayor [London] Breed, Senator [Scott] Wiener, and Assemblymember [David] Chiu in implementing approaches that most effectively address homelessness,” referring to the elected officials’ stance against Prop. C, who believe the ballot initiative will jeopardize job opportunities in the city. Both Lyft and Uber, which owns the Jump dockless bike brand, have a record of systematic discrimination against Black users, according to a transportation equity study conducted by the University of California’s Institute of Transportation Studies.The study showed Uber and Lyft drivers had a roughly 4 percent higher cancellation rate for Black passengers. However, both Lyft and Uber have a “zero-tolerance” discrimination policy. On Nov. 5, the District Department of Transportation released new regulations for its dockless vehicles pilot program. The new rules will require dockless transportation companies to offer low-income pricing plans like what Lyft has already done. In addition, companies will now be required to offer cash-payment and non-smartphone options. The new regulations also require scooters and bikes to be deployed to all eight wards every day by 6 a.m. All five dockless transportation providers in the city will need to comply with these regulations in order to operate in the district in 2019. The new guidelines reflect the goals for the program and aim to address complaints the department received regarding safety and equity, according to a DDOT press release. The new regulations also increase the number of vehicles companies may provide from 400 to 600 and also allow that many vehicles per type — bicycle and scooter each — instead of a comprehensive vehicle limit per company. Despite the increase, this limit has received some pushback from providers, according to Greater Greater Washington. David Estrada, Bird’s head of government partnerships, sent a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser saying the new regulations “would render it impossible for any provider to serve the D.C. community and truly advance the shared mission of reducing short car trips,” as reported by DCist. “Our decision to require operators to provide equitable distribution and access to dockless vehicles is consistent with Mayor Bowser’s commitment to ensuring that all residents have access to mobility options,” said the DDOT spokesperson in an e-mail. “We support this effort through the Capital Bikeshare system by offering organizations deeply discounted memberships for their clients.",https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/lyft-lobbies-against-tax-to-fund-shelter-beds-in-san-francisco-offers-scooter-discount-in-d-c/
Spin scooters hit DC streets; company doesn’t like speed limits either,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2018,11,15,"Spin scooters hit DC streets; company doesn’t like speed limits either. San Francisco-based dockless electric scooter company Spin, which entered D.C.’s dockless pilot this year with bikes but decided to pivot to electric scooters, has begun deploying its scooter fleet in D.C. It also has opinions about new dockless rules that will take effect in 2019 in the District. Spin was acquired earlier this month by Ford. Spin has launched in D.C. with 100 scooters, and will increase its District fleet by about 50 scooters per week. It said that by the end of December, it will have a fleet of 400 scooters in D.C., in all eight wards, near transit hubs, shopping areas and office parks. Like its scooter rival Bird, Spin does not think a new rule capping scooter speeds at 10 mph is a good idea. “We think that a 10 mph speed limit is the wrong way to address the District’s safety concerns about electric scooters, and may actually deter usage of an electric vehicle designed to quickly take people to their first zero and last mile,” Spin said in a statement to WTOP. “While we are set up to comply, we hope the city reconsiders this piece of regulation so they don’t unintentionally limit usage of an environmentally friendly transportation lifeline,” Spin said. Unlike Bird, which opposes a cap on the number of scooters in any one company’s fleet to 600, Spin is OK with that regulation. “We have no problems in having operators capped at 600 vehicles in D.C. while the city understands demand and usage in service areas,” the statement said. Bird argues capping fleet size will make it hard to be profitable, and will encourage scooter companies to station their scooters in only high-use areas, not underserved neighborhoods. Spin scooters are currently in nine cities and five college campuses across the country. The company said its users have taken more than one million rides to date.

Scooter and bike companies say D.C.’s new rules for dockless vehicles are too restrictive,Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2018,11,17,"Scooter and bike companies say D.C.’s new rules for dockless vehicles are too restrictive. The companies criticize official limits on fleet sizes and scooter speeds. Mobility companies that deploy scooters and dockless bikes in the District are pushing back against new regulations for the vehicles that city transportation officials declared last week. Half of the companies say the rules, which are poised to come into effect in January, overly restrict growth for their D.C. fleets. Another half say they have concerns about the 10 mph speed limit for electric scooters in the regulations. Currently, six companies operate either scooters or dockless bikes in D.C.: Bird, Lyft, Lime, Spin, Skip, and Jump, an arm of Uber. Each operator could maintain up to 600 dockless vehicles per type on city streets next year as a starting point. With regulators’ approval, they could also expand their fleets by 25 percent every three months. As of now, 400 vehicles per operator (whether scooters or bikes, or both) are allowed, under a pilot program that the District has been running since September 2017. But in a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser dated Nov. 11, California-based scooter-share operator Bird said the proposed cap on dockless vehicles “eliminates any chance of this program being equitable, of solving issues related to transportation deserts in the city, and ultimately of getting more cars off the road.” Bird also asked Bowser to “consider intervening in” the District Department of Transportation’s (DDOT) implementation of the policies to ensure “fair and practical conditions” for scooters based on “convenience and accessibility.” The company added that DDOT “provided no guidance” for how it will decide whether an operator may grow its fleet after every quarter, and that the 10 mph restriction on scooter speeds could make D.C. roads more dangerous. “Vehicles traveling at significantly different speeds...could increase opportunity for collisions between cars, e-scooters, and bikes,” Bird said. “There is also no data to suggest that 10 mph is safer for e-scooter riders than 15 mph.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for DDOT says the agency seeks to balance “the needs of users and the concerns of residents.” “From the very beginning of this program, we have tried to keep an open playing field in this emerging industry,” she points out. “The Bowser administration is committed to embracing technology that provides more transportation options that reduce the impact of emissions on our environment.” People have taken more than 940,000 rides on the scooters and bikes since the pilot program launched, per DDOT. In its instructions for applying for 2019 dockless vehicle permits, the agency says it “will reward reasonably good stewardship of public space, vehicle safety and maintenance, and adherence to data sharing conditions” in assessing whether operators may grow their fleets. Companies must apply for separate scooter and dockless bike permits to operate either type. While scooter speeds would be capped at 10 mph, electric bike speeds would be capped at 20 mph. Additionally, DDOT is mandating that dockless vehicle operators deploy at least 100 vehicles throughout D.C.’s eight wards by 6 a.m. each day. The bikes must have self-locking capabilities, as Jump’s electric bikes do, and the operators must share data with regulators. Officials have said they want to make sure that the new technologies are safe and equitable. Not all operators say they disagree with how DDOT plans to control the number of dockless vehicles in D.C. Spin, which launched scooters in the District on Thursday after it had pulled its bikes off the streets over the summer, says in a statement that it sees “no problems in having operators capped at 600 vehicles in D.C. while the city understands demand and usage in service areas.” But it says the 10 mph speed limit for scooters is “the wrong way” to address officials’ safety concerns about e-scooters and could deter riders from taking them. “While we are set up to comply, we hope the city reconsiders this piece of regulation so they don’t unintentionally limit usage of an environmentally-friendly transportation lifeline,” adds Spin, which is based in San Francisco. Skip, another San Francisco-based scooter firm, says it “supports DDOT’s measured and thoughtful approach to fleet size growth,” given its experience in other cities. “We do have some concerns, including the 10 mph speed limit, and are in the process of working with DDOT to address this issue,” Skip explains in a statement. California-based operator Lime, which pivoted to scooters from bikes in D.C. in late August, is even asking its riders to advocate for a higher dockless vehicle cap by writing to officials. “The proposed 600 vehicles are simply not enough to met the City’s transportation needs,” says Maggie Gendron, Lime’s director of strategic development, in a statement. “The most common feedback we hear from our D.C. rider community is the need for more scooters.” Ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber, which operate scooters and e-bikes, respectively, are also hoping for changes. Chris Dattaro, Lyft’s marketing manager for bikes and scooters, says his company is “working closely” with the District “to grow the size of our fleet to better meet the demand of D.C. residents who want to take city-friendly trips on two wheels.” And Uber spokesman Colin Tooze says more alternatives to cars are needed as D.C.’s population grows. “A closer look at expanding e-bikes and scooter options would be a concrete demonstration of [Mayor Bowser’s] personal commitment to attract growth in a way that is good for the environment and can be shared by everyone in the District, regardless of where they live,” says Tooze.

D.C. receives twice as many applicants for scooter and dockless bike permits for 2019,Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2018,11,29,"D.C. receives twice as many applicants for scooter and dockless bike permits for 2019. Twelve companies submitted 16 applications, as compared with six current dockless operators. D.C. could welcome as many as a dozen operators of electric scooters and dockless bikes next year, up from six who are currently participating in a pilot program that runs until the end of 2018. That means the number of dockless vehicles on D.C. streets may increase significantly. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) says it received 16 applications from 12 companies for 2019 dockless vehicle permits before the application period ended on Nov. 21. Under new regulations that DDOT announced earlier this month, companies are required to obtain separate permits for electric scooters and dockless bikes, as compared with a single permit for both types of vehicles under the pilot. The 12 companies and permits sought are: Lime (scooters and bikes) Spin (scooters) Lyft (scooters) Ridecell (scooters and bikes) HOPR/cyclehop (scooters and bikes) Jump (scooters and bikes) Skip (scooters) Wind (scooters) VeoRide (scooters) Razor (scooters) Bird (scooters) Riide (bikes) “We are pleased by the growing interest from companies seeking to expand or launch operations in the District, and excited about the potential of these new transportation options for residents and visitors,” says DDOT spokesman Terry Owens in a statement. WTOP was the first to report how many 2019 permit applications the agency received. DDOT is reviewing the applications and is set to announce the awards “in the next few weeks,” Owens says. Each new permit will let a company offer as many as 600 bikes or scooters in D.C., so, theoretically, 9,600 total vehicles (3,000 bikes plus 6,600 scooters) could initially be permitted next year if every company receives the permits it requested. As of now, Bird, Skip, Spin, Lime, Lyft, and Uber-owned Jump deploy dockless vehicles in the District. Only Jump provides a fleet that is completely composed of electric bikes—the five other operators predominately offer electric scooters at present. The companies have been capped at 400 vehicles each (whether bikes or scooters, or both) in the pilot period. “DDOT developed the initial cap per permit after careful consideration using historical caps and observing best practices among other US cities,” says a recent FAQ by the agency. The new regulations for dockless vehicles, effective in January, will enable operators to expand their respective scooter and bike fleets by 25 percent on a quarterly basis, if given approval by DDOT. Scooter speeds will be restricted to 10 mph and electric bike speeds to 20 mph. Many of the companies involved in the pilot program have complained that these rules will prohibit the growth of non-car modes of transit in the District and make it difficult to spread dockless vehicles evenly across the city. Some have said the 600-vehicle-per-permit cap is too strict and others have criticized the 10 mph speed limit on electric scooters as baseless. Scooter operator Bird wrote in a letter to Mayor Muriel Bowser on Nov. 11 that the ceiling on fleet sizes “eliminates any chance of this program being equitable, of solving issues related to transportation deserts in the city, and ultimately of getting more cars off the road.” After the rules came out, Bird, Spin, and Skip all said they were concerned about the speed limit. But Owens, the spokesman for DDOT, says the increase in permit applications for providing dockless vehicles in 2019 “suggests that these companies see the District as a viable place to do business,” and that the new rules will not prevent companies from operating successfully.

More scooter companies aim to break into the D.C. market,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2018,11,29,"More scooter companies aim to break into the D.C. market. The District’s streets could have as many as 7,000 shared scooters and 3,000 dockless bicycles by early 2019. A dozen transportation start-ups are vying for permits to operate shared scooters and bicycles in the nation’s capital next year. If all are approved, the number of companies operating personal mobility services in the District would double, and the devices available for rent could reach 10,000 by spring. The District Department of Transportation is reviewing applications from 12 companies, including six already operating in the city under an extended pilot program ending this year. Those companies want to be part of an expanded, permanent program that will allow them to enlarge their fleets — though they will be subject to additional fees and regulations. “We are pleased by the growing interest from companies seeking to expand or launch operations in the District and excited about the potential of these new transportation options for residents and visitors,” said DDOT spokesman Terry Owens. Under the expanded program, each company will be allowed to operate 600 scooters — up from 400. Start-ups then can request their fleet be increased up to 25 percent every quarter after a DDOT evaluation. Companies that meet performance measures and maintain safe and high-quality operations could be operating up to 1,200 scooters in the District by the end of 2019. E-scooter companies that want to continue operating in the District also will need to offer a cash-payment option to customers and restrict scooter speeds to 10 mph. The city will charge companies a fee of up to $5 a month per scooter or bicycle — which could add up to $36,000 annually per company. Companies operating bikes and scooters are required to apply for separate permits for each mode. Four companies have done so, and if approved, each will be allowed up to 600 bikes and 600 scooters. The city is reviewing 16 applications from 12 companies. Scooter providers Bird, Lime, Lyft, Skip and Spin (owned by Ford) plan to continue scooter operations. Lime, which began its services as a bicycle provider but replaced its bikes with scooters over the summer, is also applying for a bicycle fleet. Jump (owned by Uber) is seeking a permit to continue its popular electric-bike service and has filed for a permit to deploy e-scooters. New entrants are scooter companies Wind, VeoRide and Razor. Ridecell and HOPR/Cyclehop are applying for scooters and bikes, and Riide wants to bring in bicycles. D.C. transportation officials said they will make a determination on the applicants before the end of the year. The high number of applicants is a good sign that the District continues to be a magnet for innovators, they said, and that its regulatory approach isn’t scaring away companies. “The growing interest suggests these companies see the District as a viable place to do business and that the proposed dockless regulations do not prohibit companies from operating successfully,” Owens said. The District has been criticized for taking a slow-growth approach toward the services, but companies say they want to continue to work with the city to grow and answer demand from residents and visitors who have embraced the scooters as another mode of transportation to navigate the capital and a busy downtown area. If all the applicants are approved and launch the maximum number of vehicles, the city would have nearly 10,000 scooters.

Six things D.C. says it’s learned about scooters and dockless bikes since they arrived,Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2018,12,21,"Six things D.C. says it’s learned about scooters and dockless bikes since they arrived. Overall ridership increased significantly, but the growth was uneven across the city. As District officials prepare to see more electric scooters and dockless bikes on city streets next year, they are also reflecting on what they have learned since welcoming the vehicles through a pilot program that kicked off last year. This week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration submitted an official report on the pilot program to District policymakers. The report shows that the overall use of dockless vehicles has grown significantly over the course of the pilot, from more than 10,000 trips taken in September 2017—the month it launched—to more than 100,000 trips taken in April 2018 and subsequent months. During that same period, the number of scooter and dockless bike riders also ballooned, from just under 6,000 riders to tens of thousands of riders. Individual vehicles saw more daily trips. The report includes other findings about electric scooters and dockless bikes, outlined below. But first, a couple of caveats: It is largely based on data provided to officials by the companies that supplied the vehicles, and covers only the first 10 months of the program, through June 2018. In a letter accompanying the report, Bowser writes that the District still has “so much to learn” about scooters and dockless bikes and will continue to evaluate their performance. 1) Scooters drove the growth in dockless vehicle ridership. “Bicycles saw steady usage across fall months with a decrease across the winter months,” the report says. “The number of [dockless] trips increased dramatically in spring 2018 with the introduction of scooters.” This could help explain why the majority of the applications for 2019 dockless vehicle permits that the District has received are for scooters (11 of 16 total applications). 2) Dockless vehicles do not seem to have eaten into Capital Bikeshare ridership or revenue and may actually have complemented them. “During the demonstration period,” says the report, “dockless ridership appears to be additive to Capital Bikeshare and has increased overall bikeshare ridership in comparison to 2017 and 2016.” Such a finding aligns with research on dockless vehicles, out of Georgetown University, that was based on similar data. (Capital Bikeshare piloted e-bikes from September 2018 through November.) 3) But more Capital Bikeshare bikes went missing during the dockless vehicles pilot than ever before in the service’s history. The report says the number of Capital Bikeshare bikes that were not returned to stations since the début of the program (126) was more than double the number recorded in the preceding seven years of Capital Bikeshare’s operations (61). Here’s how D.C. officials put it: “Capital Bikeshare is experiencing greater confusion among riders regarding the requirement to end a trip by docking a bicycle at a station.” Turns out scooters and dockless bikes aren’t the only vehicles witnessing misuse. 4) Dockless vehicle trips are concentrated in Wards 1, 2, and 6, and tend to be short. The report says most riders use scooters and dockless bikes to travel less than a mile. The majority of trips registered during the first 10 months of the pilot occurred within Ward 2. Meanwhile, as the Washington Post recently reported, Wards 7 and 8 remain underserved. New regulations for the vehicles that are set to go into effect in January require that mobility companies provide at least six vehicles each in every one of D.C.’s eight wards by 6 a.m. daily. A current 400-vehicle-per-company cap will also be raised, permitting more vehicles in total. 5) Dockless vehicles have been involved in some crashes. Thirty crashes were reported to the District Department of Transportation through July 2018, including 18 injuries, the report notes. The data came from the mobility companies and D.C. police. “Additional crashes and injuries may have occurred that were not reported either to [the Metropolitan Police Department] or the companies,” according to the report. Beyond the data period—in September 2018—a driver fatally struck a scooter rider in Dupont Circle. 6) Data on dockless vehicles can be hard to pin down. Although the companies that have participated in the pilot are required to share information about trips with the District, this has not always gone smoothly. “[T]here were initial challenges in standardizing the data and getting complete data from companies,” the report says. “Data compliance issues made it difficult to gauge the performance of the program at times and have highlighted that full and complete data is crucial.” To improve such issues, officials say they are considering working with Los Angeles, which has developed a means of systematizing data on dockless vehicles.",https://dc.curbed.com/2018/12/21/18150702/dc-scooters-dockless-bikes-pilot-ddot-report

The transit authority is expanding a policy of allowing them on trains in response to feedback from bike advocates, it announced this week. Since 2001, bikes have been banned on the rail system during rush hour—from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays—even as bike use in D.C. has surged. “We believe this change supports ridership growth by Metro and a commuting option for those who want to have a bike with them,” said Joe Leader, Metro’s chief operating officer, in a statement. The transit agency says it seeks to increase the share of its customers who arrive at its rail stations via bike to more than 2 percent by 2020, from less than 1 percent in 2016. Metro adds that it reviewed its most recent policy and concluded that it could end the rush-hour ban “without significant negative effects,” in part because its new 7000-series trains have more open space than their predecessors and most of its rush-hour trains are currently eight cars long. Metro says it expects the change to benefit reverse commuters in particular. Metro has not always allowed bikes on its rail system. They were completely banned when Metrorail first opened, in 1976, but were subsequently allowed, starting in 1982, under paid permits on weekends and holidays. The permits were done away with in 1998, notes Metro. The fine print of the new policy is that “standard-size bikes will be allowed at all times, on any car of any train, provided that space is available.” Metro is also reserving the “ability to restrict bicycles on the rail system during major events drawing high ridership, such as July 4 fireworks and Inauguration Day.” It says it will track how riders adapt to the new policy and discourages them from boarding with their bikes through center doors and blocking passage. Asked whether electric scooters and electric bikes would be allowed under the change, a Metro spokesman says nothing in the policy precludes them. “Same guidelines apply: give priority to seniors/people with disabilities, use the end doors (not the center doors), don’t carry them on escalators, and be courteous to your fellow riders,” he explains in an email. Metro’s buses can also carry two full-size bikes at a time, on existing racks on their fronts.",https://dc.curbed.com/2019/1/3/18166574/dc-metro-wmata-bikes-scooters-public-transit
Lime electric scooters are 1st for Alexandria’s dockless pilot program,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,1,8,"Lime electric scooters are 1st for Alexandria’s dockless pilot program. San Francisco-based dockless electric scooter and electric bike operator Lime has received a permit from the city of Alexandria, Virginia — the first operator to win approval there as part of a nine-month pilot program. The Alexandria City Council approved the pilot in November. The city is accepting permit applications from other operators in addition to Lime. Dockless scooters and bikes are now operating by way of formal agreements in the District, Arlington County, Virginia, and parts of Montgomery County, Maryland. While there is no formal agreement with Fairfax County, Virginia, for dockless mobility operators, there is also currently no requirement in Fairfax for such agreements. Montgomery County has gradually expanded its pilot dockless bike program, although it does not, as of now, include electric scooters. As of 2019, the District’s dockless program was permanent, with new restrictions on the number of scooters and bikes each company can operate, speed limitations on scooters and new requirements about how and where scooters and bikes can be parked. D.C.’s dockless program has also expanded to up to a dozen companies that have applied or been approved. In Alexandria, the pilot program will evaluate the safety and popularity of dockless scooters and bikes and the performance of companies that enroll in the pilot. Alexandria is also soliciting public input during the nine-month pilot. Dockless companies are charged a one-time $5,000 permit fee in Alexandria for the pilot period, and each company will be limited to 200 total bikes and scooters, unless ridership spikes. Alexandria has posted information about its dockless pilot online.",https://wtop.com/business-finance/2019/01/lime-electric-scooters-are-first-in-alexandria/
Everyday Advice: How to Ride a Scooter Without Killing Yourself,Washingtonian,,"Washington, DC",2019,1,11,"Everyday Advice: How to Ride a Scooter Without Killing Yourself. Hundreds more scooters are about to hit DC streets—and are more complicated than they look. Here's some advice. No one ever tells you how to operate a scooter. Easy as riding a bike, right? Or so you might think as you ponder the myriad dockless, app-driven electric scooters on city sidewalks, just waiting for you to hop on. Turns out it’s a bit more complicated. Judging by the number of scooter-related injuries in emergency rooms, Washington has its share of scooter dunces. Yet while self-respecting adults might feel perfectly comfortable asking for tips about some other form of motorized transport, there’s something vaguely embarrassing about seeking instruction on how to ride a vehicle usually associated with elementary school. But you know what’s even more embarrassing? Telling your family you spent the afternoon at urgent care after a scooter boo-boo. So although I was once an eye-rolling skeptic, I decided to give scooters a try in order to make myself an actual expert, the kind who can suggest best practices, to use a phrase typically not employed in conjunction with scooters. After all, someone has to be an expert: For all the scoffs they leave in their wake, scooters appear to be here to stay. Starting in 2019, operators including Lime, Bird, Lyft, Skip, and Spin may be permitted to maintain up to 600 scooters in the District, versus 400 during a pilot program that’s wrapping up. Those fleets could grow by up to 25 percent every three months, pending regulators’ approval. With more startups trying to secure permits to operate in the city, the total number of scooters available for rent could reach 7,000 by spring. One thing that became obvious the more I rode: Scooters are a really fun way to get around—and being amused isn’t always conducive to being alert. When I’m riding, I think about how nice the rushing air feels on my face and how much closer sustainable, convenient, and affordable urban mobility feels thanks to people like me. I don’t necessarily think about how great an idea it would be to look at the ground ahead of me. Clearly, I’m not alone. Since electric scooters first showed up here in September 2017, when the District Department of Transportation kicked off the pilot program, 28 crashes and 21 injuries for dockless scooters and dockless bikes, collectively, have been reported to DDOT. (The bike and scooter companies, which report the data, don’t yet separate out scooter mishaps.) Presumably, many more incidents go unreported. In September, DC saw its first fatal accident involving a rented scooter. An SUV struck 20-year-old Carlos Sanchez-Martin, who was riding near Dupont Circle. He was pinned under the vehicle and dragged about 20 yards. Police have yet to determine who was at fault, and no charges have been filed. James Phillips, an emergency physician at George Washington University Hospital, says GW’s trauma center is seeing victims of scooter-related accidents at least once a week. Some of the injuries are minor, such as scraped knees and elbows. “But we’ve seen much more serious injuries, such as dental trauma and facial fractures,” Phillips says. “We’ve seen head injuries.” One reason is that helmets aren’t required. Scooter companies can only suggest that riders wear protective gear. Yet another factor contributing to mishaps, says Phillips: “Alcohol. I’ve definitely seen intoxicated students riding these.” For those who’d like to scooter to their next meeting, date, or brunch and want to boost their chances of not getting injured, here are other things to keep in mind. Scootering 101 1. If you’re a novice, practice braking before riding at high speeds. It can actually take a while to figure out how to come to a stop smoothly. 2. The small wheels and low ground clearance make riders especially vulnerable to bumps, rocks, and unevenness. To stay stable, slow down when navigating tricky terrain, and keep your knees slightly bent. 3. Look out for grates. Those little wheels can get caught in the spaces. 4. Avoid wet roads. Scooter tires can lose traction fast. 5. On a congested sidewalk, walk your scooter. Scooters must stay off sidewalks in the Central Business District, an area that stretches south of Massachusetts Avenue, Northwest, to Foggy Bottom, then east to encompass the Mall. 6. When passing parked cars, watch out for drivers opening car doors. 7. Don’t ride with a passenger, and don’t ride one-handed. 8. If you have the option of a sidewalk or a bike lane, the bike lane is the safer call. 9. Don’t exceed the weight limit for riders, about 220 pounds. 10. Yeah, we know you’ve heard it before, but a helmet is always a great idea. Don’t have one? Companies including Lime and Bird will send you a helmet for free. 11. When parking a scooter, leave it out of the way of foot traffic. 12. Prepare for the unexpected. Even prudent riders can run into trouble when a scooter malfunctions—there have been reports of failing brakes and scooters coming apart mid-ride. Xiaomi and Segway are among the manufacturers supplying firms such as Lime and Bird, and they say scooters should be stored in a cool, dry place. Staying outdoors for long periods is apparently bad for them.",https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/01/11/everyday-advice-how-to-ride-a-scooter-without-killing-yourself/
Residents Review Alexandria's Dockless Scooter Program,Alexandria Living,,"Washington, DC",2019,2,27,"Residents Review Alexandria's Dockless Scooter Program. Alexandria’s pilot program testing dockless scooters (and bikes) is rolling along. There are currently five vendors working with the city on the pilot (or “demonstration”) program that is allowing residents to test using electric scooters and dockless bicycles for transportation. Those companies are Lyft, Lime, Bolt, Byrd and Jump. Skip and Spin have also indicated interest in participating in the program, said Christine Mayeur, Complete Streets Coordinator at the City’s Transportation & Environmental Services department. Each company is limited in the number of dockless scooters and bikes they can deploy in the region. “The purpose of this demonstration program will be to evaluate the safety and popularity of shared mobility devices (such as e-scooters and dockless shared bikes) and overall performance of the companies,” according to Alexandria’s dockless mobility website. Since the city started allowing dockless scooters and bikes to operate in Alexandria, city officials have received no reports of accidents or crashes. Some residents have expressed concern about the speed and safety of the electric scooters in comments city officials have received, Mayeur said. Other residents have noted that the dockless mobility devices are a good “last mile” option to get to and from their bus stop faster or fill in gaps between Capital Bikeshare stations. “Other people say they’re just fun to ride,” Mayeur said. The companies that have permits to operate in Alexandria deploy scooters daily based on projected demand, and collect them late at night for recharging and repair. The city has provided residents with rules for using the scooters, including the following: Scooters cannot be ridden on sidewalks. Certain trails, all bikelanes and streets are allowed. Riders must follow traffic laws, including stopping at stop lights and stop signs. The devices should not be left anywhere that impedes pedestrian or vehicle traffic in any way. Additional information on the demonstration program is available on the City’s Dockless Mobility webpage here. If you’re trying a scooter for the first time, Mayeur has a few recommendations: Definitely have a helmet for safety. Although there have been no reported accidents in Alexandria since the program started, it’s better to be safe. Obey the traffic laws -- including coming to a full stop at stop signs and red lights, yielding to pedestrians and using hand signals while turning. Try out a scooter for the first time in a place where you’d feel comfortable – on a low-traffic street or a parking lot. Scooters are not allowed on sidewalks in Alexandria. Try scooters from each company. Each model is a little bit different in how it rides, and you might like one better than another. Read the instructions. For example, some have lights that turn on automatically, others don’t. Make sure you know how to use the brakes. When the demonstration program ends in September, scooters will be removed from Alexandria until City officials are able to create final policies regarding usage. To provide feedback on the program, email dockless.mobility@alexandriava.gov.",https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/api/content/32e7855e-3af0-11e9-b63b-120e7ad5cf50/
Bolt joins Arlington scooters; top scooter complaints?,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,3,6,"Bolt joins Arlington scooters; top scooter complaints? There are now seven dockless electric scooter companies operating in Arlington, Virginia, with the recent addition of Bolt, as part of the county’s pilot program to see what works and what doesn’t with dockless bike and scooter companies. So far, it is mostly working. There are complaints, but complaints have tapered off significantly since fall, though that may partially because of less usage during the winter months. The Arlington County Board approved a demonstration project in September 2018, which started in October. To date, e-scooter operators include Bolt, Bird, JUMP, Lime, Lyft, Skip and Spin. Bolt was approved for deployment Feb. 14 and went live in the county Feb. 27. The county continues to solicit email feedback from county residents and it says the number of monthly complaints has declined from several hundred in October and November, to 75 in January. In addition to a weather related slowdown in use, the county also believes the drop off in complaints is because of increased compliance with rules as riders and residents become more familiar. The top issues Arlington has received about electric scooters are sidewalk riding, improper parking, unsafe rider behaviors and underage riders. (Individual companies set age restrictions in their terms of service, not the county.) Arlington’s dockless pilot program wraps up in July, with a decision to follow about allowing dockless companies to operate permanently and under what rules and regulations. Virginia’s Alexandria and Maryland’s Montgomery County are running their own dockless pilot programs currently.

Uber introduces Jump scooters to D.C. and changes its price structure for its popular e-bikes,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,4,16,"Uber introduces Jump scooters to D.C. and changes its price structure for its popular e-bikes. Some bike trips cost twice as much now. Good news for scooter lovers. Uber, which operates the electric-bike-share service known as Jump, is introducing electric scooters in the District ? most likely adding a few hundred more scooters to a city where a handful of other companies already provide the service. With the addition of scooters, Uber changed the usage fees for its popular Jump e-bikes, essentially replacing it with a pricing structure that applies to both scooters and bikes. Riders now can unlock the bikes and scooters for free and pay 15 cents per minute. The cost to rent the Jump scooter is more competitive than other scooter services in the region, including Lyft, Bird, Lime, Spin and Skip. All of those companies charge $1 to start a trip and charge a fee that ranges from 15 cents to 29 cents per minute, depending on the company. But for the loyal Jump e-bike users, the new pricing structure may not be such a sweet deal. Under the old pricing, users paid $2 for the first 30 minutes, then $0.07 per minute after that. Anyone who timed their trip to last 30 minutes would now pay $4.50 a trip — more than double what they used to pay. Uber officials say the new price structure, however, will benefit riders who make short trips, noting that while the minimum fare was $2 (up to 30 minutes), now the minimum is $0.15 for a minute ride. To save or break even at $2, a rider would need to complete a trip in less than 13 minutes. That’s unlikely, many Jump users say. They say they embraced the Jump e-bikes because they provide that extra power to go on longer trips, and helped them replace commutes via car, Metro or bus. Jump brought its e-bikes to the city in fall 2017 and almost immediately became one of the most popular private bike-share services. Uber acquired Jump a year ago. By essentially doubling the price of Jump bike trips, some users say, Uber may see declines in the usage of its bike fleet just as the company faces questions about the safety of its bikes. The company acknowledged Monday that it had modified some of its e-bikes recently after the company encountered a braking problem similar to the one that prompted rival Lyft to pull its own electric bikes in several cities over the weekend. But for regular Jump riders, the new pricing structure, announced a day before it was introduced, caught them by surprise. At $2 per 30-minute ride, some said, Jump was comparable to using Capital Bikeshare, the region’s subsidized bike system that offers conventional bike rides for $2 per 30-minute trip. Or taking the bus, which costs $2 a trip. “I’d rather that you not increase the price of Jump bikes, a service I have enjoyed and relied on,” Tucker Cholvin tweeted to Uber last week.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/04/16/uber-introduces-jump-scooters-dc-changes-its-price-structure-its-popular-e-bikes/
D.C. permits almost 5K shared electric scooters and electric bikes on city streets,Curbed Washington DC,Curbed,"Washington, DC",2019,5,1,"D.C. permits almost 5K shared electric scooters and electric bikes on city streets. The city has issued permits for an additional 735 dockless vehicles to be deployed in the District. The growth of shared electric scooters and electric bikes in the city continues to putter ahead. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) said Tuesday it had issued permits for an additional 300 dockless bikes and 435 scooters to operate on city streets, meaning that as of May 1, 4,935 total dockless vehicles may legally be deployed by various micromobility firms. Six companies currently operate the vehicles in D.C.: Bird, Lime, Lyft, Skip, Spin, and Jump, which is owned by Uber and provides both scooters and bikes here unlike the others. DDOT said the permit expansion is in line with rules it earlier established allowing dockless vehicle operators to grow their fleets by up to 25 percent each quarter, following official evaluations. In terms of sheer number, the expansion positions D.C. among American cities as relatively friendly toward dockless scooters and bikes. Still, critics have said some of the current rules for the vehicles are too restrictive, including a 10 mph speed limit on electric scooter speeds and a requirement for all dockless bikes to come equipped with self-locking functions. City lawmakers are also considering greater legal protections for electric bike and scooter riders. In a statement, DDOT Director Jeff Marootian called the addition of the new permits “the next step in [D.C.’s] incremental approach to integrating dockless vehicles in the District’s transportation network.” The agency said the new permits allow for 300 more Jump bikes, 75 more Lime scooters, 120 more Lyft scooters, 120 more Spin scooters, and 120 more Skip scooters. D.C. began welcoming these vehicles through a pilot program in September 2017. A 2018 DDOT report found that electric scooters were largely driving the growth of dockless vehicles in the District and that trips were concentrated in the city’s core areas, though data was limited. The report also found that such vehicles did not hamper Capital Bikeshare use.",https://dc.curbed.com/2019/5/1/18525517/dc-scooters-bikes-electric-dockless-micromobility-growth
DC set to raise e-scooter speed limit,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,5,3,"DC set to raise e-scooter speed limit. Electric scooters will likely be allowed to go faster in the District. The D.C. Council Committee on Transportation and the Environment approved a change requested by dockless scooter companies that will permit electric scooters to go up to 15 mph on flat ground rather than the current limit of 10 mph. The change would still require scooter users to go at the slower speed when riding on a sidewalk, but would allow the higher speeds on streets and in bike lanes. There is no plan to change the speed cap for electric-assist bikes from 20 mph on flat ground. As dockless shared bikes and scooters expand in the District, the council is also set to fund a $115,000 test of painted parking spaces for the vehicles in busy areas. At least one of the parking areas would be set up in each of the city’s business improvement districts. Those stretch from Anacostia to Adams Morgan. The spots would be only a recommendation to users, not a requirement. Similar “scooter parking” has already been set up in Arlington, Virginia. With marked spaces or stickers on the sidewalk, the hope is the scooters would be more likely to remain out of the way of people walking. After increases approved effective Wednesday, the District now has issued permits for up to 4,935 dockless bikes and scooters. Jump was permitted to add 300 more bikes; Lyft, Skip and Spin were permitted to add up to 120 more scooters each. Lime was permitted to add 75 more scooters. The increases were based on the District Department of Transportation’s review of compliance with city rules over the first three months of the year based on: compliance with handling big snow storms, resolving parking complaints, and keeping bikes or scooters out and available; submitting all required data on time and in a proper format; following through on equity requirements to reach out to low-income customers, ensure at least some bikes or scooters are available in all eight wards each day, and to offer a cash payment option; meeting safety requirements tied to speed tests, and checks of bikes and scooters in the field for maintenance and other issues. Three other companies that have not yet launched dockless shared electric bikes or scooters in the city remain eligible to if they pay permit fees.

How long do those e-scooters last? Not long,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,5,10,"How long do those e-scooters last? Not long. Despite the popularity of electric scooter rentals that are proliferating in the Washington area and other big cities, profitability for the companies is challenged by, among other things, the need to constantly invest capital to replace them. Scooter companies are beginning to address that challenge by investing in more durable scooters. E-scooter company Bird, one of several companies with fleets of scooters deployed around the Washington, D.C. region, said when it first hit the streets two years ago, the consumer-grade scooters it was using lasted three months, at best, because of the abuse and constant use the e-scooters were getting. Last year, Bird began upgrading its fleet with what it dubbed Bird Zero scooters, more commercial-grade versions built for sustainable use that it says will last on average more than 10 months in the sharing environment because of durability and increased battery capacity. Now it is introducing even more durable scooters it calls Bird One, based on the Xiaomi Mijia M365 model. “Bird One builds on the benefits and learning of Bird Zero, and is forecasted to last in the sharing environment for well over a year,” said Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden. The Bird One also has battery life that lasts two times longer, giving it greater range between when the company needs to collect and recharge the scooters. Bird is testing monthly scooter rentals in San Francisco, and monthly rentals may come to D.C. It has now moved into the business of selling its scooters. They sell for about $1,300",https://wtop.com/business-finance/2019/05/how-long-do-those-e-scooters-last-not-long/
"Scooters in Alexandria Part 2: For riders, e-scooters are more than just a fad ",Alexandria Times,,"Washington, DC",2019,5,16,"Scooters in Alexandria Part 2: For riders, e-scooters are more than just a fad. One mile. For drivers, it is a distance easily crossed. For runners, a mile is only the start of a workout. For commuters, though, that seemingly short distance can present problems; it might be only a 20- to 25- minute walk, but a mile can make all the difference. “There’s a lot of times where I need to go somewhere between a mile and a mile and a half [away],” Ethan McAfee, an Old Town resident, said. “For me, my house to my office in Old Town is 1.2 miles, and historically your options would be, I’m either going to walk – and walking would take like 20 minutes, give or take – [or] I would drive, which it kind of seems silly to drive a mile, but that’s kind of the default.” A 20-minute walk is nice for some, but when time is of the essence, that mile can seem like a gaping chasm. Recently, however, McAfee and others have found a solution to their mile-long problem. “I started taking scooters,” McAfee said. “All of a sudden you’re no longer having to drive; you’re no lon- ger having to find parking spaces. That 20-minute walk becomes an eight-minute scooter ride.” While a chorus of outrage echoes across Alexandria over the presence of e-scooters, many residents – mostly younger commuters – have flocked to the disruptive technology for convenience and accessibility. Others, including visitors, ride them for enjoyment. Within four months of the launch of the city’s scooter pilot program in December 2018, riders had taken more than 22,000 trips, according to the Department of Transportation and Environmental Services. For some, a simple joyride one sunny day quickly evolved into a daily routine. “That was kind of the genesis of it. ‘Hey, that looks fun; it will be interesting to try once and get it under my belt,’” Travis Niles, an Old Town resident who works in D.C., said. “… But then as time progressed, it legitimately started affecting my daily schedule.” Niles, like a lot of commuters, travels to and from the Metro every day. Before scooters, he’d either drive and face the challenge of parking near the Metro, or take DASH buses. “[Scooters are] far more predicable than DASH and more nimble than a car,” Niles said. West End resident Chris Sims relies on public transportation to get to his job in Old Town, since he doesn’t own a car. The scooters have become an extension of his daily travel routine, he said. “Usually I’ll take the bus to the Metro station at King Street Metro or Braddock Metro and then take the scooter somewhere I need to go,” Sims said. The ubiquity of the scooters, a quality that some residents have bemoaned, has opened up travel for other residents, especially commuters. “What it’s doing is for people who are using the Metro, it’s providing that last mile connectivity,” McAfee said. “… Now with the scooters you can be 10 blocks, 20 blocks away and still consistently use the Metro without having to walk half an hour to get there.” For these riders, scooters are more than just a fad; they are a convenient new mode of transportation that can remove the need for a car. “They are a great and green way to get around town, and I know we use our car less now that we’ve started using scooters,” resident Katie Ray said in a Facebook message. “Your short car ride can now quickly become a short scooter ride,” McAfee said. “That decreases the amount of traffic, decreases the amount of parking issues, decreases the amount of car congestion.” While some riders are using the scooters for business, just as many are using them for pleasure. On sunny days, the joyriders populate the city’s streets, parks and, to the concern of many pedestrians, sidewalks. According to the city’s memorandum of understanding that every scooter company must sign, riders must be 18 years or older and cannot ride on sidewalks. Several younger riders said they enjoy the scooters because they offer an easy way of getting around Old Town without the need to rely on their parents for rides. Some scooter companies now require riders to take a picture of driver’s licenses or other I.D. either during the sign-up process or before a ride. Rider behavior has been a sticking point for many who oppose the pilot program. Those who ride the scooters insist that many of the complaints – sidewalk riding and improper parking – are edge cases, highly visible examples of the worst behavior. “They sort of amplify, or make more visible, those bad habits that we have contained in all of us,” Niles said. “If you are already going to be inconsiderate and leave something in the way and diminish a public good, you were already going to do that. The scooter didn’t change it.” However, even riders like Niles admit to engaging in the alleged poor behavior, often out of necessity due to Alexandria’s road infrastructure. “Sometimes riding on the sidewalk is unavoidable because of where you are,” Niles said. “If you’re on certain permutations of one-ways, it’s faster to ride on the sidewalk.” Niles said he dismounts during these sidewalk detours; however, many riders do not take such precautions. Temporary signage reminding people not to ride on sidewalks has sprung up throughout Alexandria in recent weeks. Safety is one area of behavior where those who are for and against scooters differ. Virginia does not require riders over the age of 14 to wear helmets, and several riders admitted that wearing a helmet for the distance and duration of a scooter ride feels unnecessary. “In general, we all feel we ‘should’ but no one actually does,” McAfee said in an email. “I think most people just view it as a ‘short trip’ and are willing to risk it. I feel it is a different mindset than someone commuting 10 miles on their bike because the speeds are slower and the distance is much shorter.” A recent study conducted by University of California Los Angeles researchers found that in only 4 percent of 249 scooter-related injuries, the riders were wearing helmets. Some companies, including Jump and Skip, are starting to offer helmets to their riders. Jump is working on a partnership with VeloCity Bike Cooperative in Del Ray to offer riders free helmets, and Skip’s safety promotion allows riders to purchase a helmet for about $10. Niles did not initially use a helmet but has since purchased one through Skip’s safety promotion. While they may seem carefree, several riders said they, too, have concerns about scooters. Sims admitted that sometimes, especially late at night, the vehicles are not charged, at which point a convenience quickly becomes inconvenient. In many cases, riders shared the concerns of their fellow residents who oppose the scooters. “I think it’s a good thing for tourists and residents, I just wish people would take more care of them because sometimes you’ll see them stacked up on the corner and just on the ground and it looks really bad,” Sims said. Several riders voiced support for designated parking areas in high traffic areas like Old Town and Del Ray, an idea that T&ES staff has been exploring as part of the pilot program. “Obviously [scooters] are point-to-point and [you can] discard them wherever you want, but if you offer people safe places to leave them, like Capital Bikeshare has their docking stations, that’s something you can do as an incentive to cluster them in strategic areas and get people to return them in a responsible way,” Niles said. And even those who ride the scooters are troubled by the sheer number of scooters and scooter companies that have arrived in Alexandria. “The cost of entry was really low, so every scooter company did it. What ended up happening is that we have too many scooter brands and too many scooters,” McAfee said. “What will likely happen, my hope, is that the city agrees to go from seven scooter companies to two or three.” More distressing for riders is the discourse that has swirled around the scooters and between relatively younger riders and relatively older residents. “I am fearful that Old Town is becoming a place where any change is viewed as bad,” McAfee said. “With any change and with any technological progress, we have to look at it as a tradeoff.” If the 22,000 trips are any indication, many residents have embraced this latest form of transportation technology. For some, a mile makes all the difference. The sudden appearance of hundreds of scooters in Alexandria the last few months has left residents outraged and intrigued, while raising questions of accountability and safety. This is the second article in a multi-part series exploring the issue.",https://alextimes.com/2019/05/scooter-riders/
Dockless No More? Spin Will Test Solar-Powered Stations For Scooters,DCist,Gothamist,"Washington, DC",2019,5,23,"Dockless No More? Spin Will Test Solar-Powered Stations For Scooters. Spin will start installing its docking stations for the pilot program by the end of the week, according to the scooter company. Over the next two weeks, 40 docking stations will be placed in D.C., Arlington, and Alexandria, each of which can hold between four and 10 scooters. The company partnered with private property owners to place the docking stations, and the Spin app will show their locations. During the pilot, dockless scooters will remain available. The timing was first reported by the Washington Post. Original: This summer, you might see something new on D.C.’s streets: docks for otherwise dockless scooters. The city will play host to a 60-day pilot program, a partnership between electric scooter company Spin, which launched in D.C. last year, and docking system start-up Swiftmile. The big question: if you provide a place to dock scooters, will people actually put scooters there when they’re done using them? Thousands of scooters have appeared in D.C. over the last year as part of the city’s dockless vehicle program. Each operator can have as many as 600 vehicles at the outset, and companies are allowed to increase their fleets if they meet certain requirements. The scooter influx has prompted grumbling from pedestrians that the vehicles are often dumped in inconvenient or unsafe places. And then there’s the matter of needing to charge them. Most companies pay people a flat rate to collect and charge their scooters, while Spin employees pick them up and take them to a warehouse where they’re charged back up, according to Ben Fong, director of business development at the company. Enter Swiftmile, which has created a solar-powered docking station capable of charging up all brands of e-scooters. Co-founder and CEO Colin Roche tells DCist that the company debuted in February at SXSW and hopes to provide an antidote to the electric scooter chaos. “We put [the docking system] out on the streets guerilla-style, and it caused a total scene. There was a sea of scooters knocked over, and then you had this system that was very orderly,” he said, also touting the fact that the station’s batteries are fully solar-powered, making the system a fully renewable transit option. For the purposes of this summer’s pilot, the docks will be exclusively available for Spin scooters. The Washington Post first reported on the plan. In addition to decluttering streets and saving a trip to the warehouse, Fong believes they’ll make it easier and more reliable to find a scooter—much like riders always know where Capital Bikeshare bikes will be located. That’s a big selling point for the pilot program, which is on the hunt for private property owners who would be willing to host the docking stations. “It’s a real amenity for residents and employees,” Fong says. But it remains to be seen if scooter users will use the docks, especially considering the appeal of leaving a scooter behind the instant that it’s no longer needed. “We’re not saying that these scooters have to be parked in a docking station every time someone ends a ride,” Roche says. “But in busy areas where scooters congregate, and are sort of a nuisance at this point—that’s where you place the docking station.” Fong agrees, and says he sees it becoming “a hybrid model that retains the flexibility of a dockless model, but the reliability of having a docking station with scooters reliably there,” he says. Though the details aren’t yet clear, Spin plans to put some sort of in-app incentive for riders to bring the scooters to a dock when they’ve finished a ride. D.C. is one of two cities—Ann Arbor, Michigan is the other—that will host the pilot. “D.C. is a compact city that we think can benefit from having some dock stations around town, just given the geography,” says Fong of why Spin and Swiftmile chose to test the stations here. He also noted that general excitement from D.C. scooter users and an interest from potential local partners played a role in the decision. The pilot will focus on putting docking stations in areas that already see high traffic for the existing fleet of Spin scooters and parts of town that aren’t well served by public transportation, according to Fong, who cited Capitol Hill, H Street, and Adams Morgan as neighborhoods that could benefit. “People that travel more than a mile and a half is where the sweet spot is for when it’s helpful to have a scooter around,” he says.",https://dcist.com/story/19/05/23/dockless-no-more-spin-will-test-solar-powered-stations-for-scooters/
People Are Leaving Scooters All Over a National Park,Washingtonian,,"Washington, DC",2019,5,23,"People Are Leaving Scooters All Over a National Park. The Mount Vernon Trail offers unparalleled views of our nation’s capital and is a delightful route for cyclists, walkers, and joggers. It’s also a great place to see dozens of dockless scooters lying on their sides. I counted 34 along a three-mile stretch from just before Gravelly Point to the Roosevelt Bridge on my bike ride to work Monday morning—an average of one every 466 feet. There’s a delicious air of mystery to many of these scooters, which have been left in places with no obvious egress from the trail. Were the riders sucked up to heaven in some sort of multi-modal mini rapture? Did friends with tandem bikes happen by? Or maybe the riders just hoofed it after the batteries ran out? National Park Service spokesperson Jonathan Shafer says the agency doesn’t keep records on improperly parked bikes and scooters and suggests contacting the scooter companies when you see them strewn about. “Bikes or scooters that adversely affect visitor safety, orderly management of park areas, or threaten park natural or cultural resources may be impounded,” he says. Some of the scooters enjoy a long stay on the banks of the Potomac because they’re so inconvenient to pick up. Scooter companies tend to employ freelance “juicers” who collect and recharge the vehicles, then leave them in convenient spots for other riders. But even the most motivated juicer would have to spend a lot of time if they wanted to harvest some of these scooters. The scooter companies encourage people to contact them to report the vehicles, which are supposedly GPS-enabled but okay. I contacted all six that operate in DC, and most said they had a team that collects scooters; all encouraged park users to report strays. “In many cases, our team will locate and collect the vehicles on foot, such as on the Mount Vernon Trail,” a Jump spokesperson says. A Lime spokesperson praised the company’s “robust local operations team” and asks anyone who sees a scooter out of place to report it via the app or by texting 888-LIME-345. Bird says the company is “thrilled to see residents rely on options like Bird to commute from Arlington to DC and back” and asks people dismayed by the placement of one of the company’s scooters to report the fugitive in the “Community Mode” section of its app. Rob McPherson, the general manager for Skip in Washington, DC, says that, for hard-to-reach scooters, the company pays higher rates that escalate until they’re picked up. “This summer,” he says, “we are also hiring interns specifically to educate riders about proper riding and parking practices.” I like these scooters and want them to succeed. But those interns and operations teams have a big task ahead of them: on Thursday morning, I counted 29 scooters along the same stretch of path.",https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/05/23/people-are-leaving-scooters-all-over-a-national-park/
Montgomery County rolls out e-scooter program,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,5,31,"Montgomery County rolls out e-scooter program. The county will allow electric scooters and e-bikes on some county trails. The popular electric scooters available for rent in the District, Arlington and Alexandria will be rolling through the streets of Montgomery County starting Saturday. The county is launching a pilot program to allow shared scooters in Silver Spring, Takoma Park and North Bethesda, joining a growing number of jurisdictions in the Washington region and beyond that have welcomed the personal mobility services. Concurrently with the program, the county is set to allow electric bikes and scooters on some of its park trails, a shift from a long-standing policy banning the devices. E-scooters and e-bikes are not allowed on trails in the region, including those owned by the National Park Service. Montgomery County is one the first jurisdictions in the Washington region to change that policy, in part responding to a higher usage of e-bikes. Other jurisdictions in the region and across the U.S. are revising regulations that restrict their use, including bans against riding them on sidewalks and trails. Cycling advocates say the policies are outdated, unrealistic and confuse riders. The District is drafting rules to allow the pedal-assist bikes on trails and possibly sidewalks outside the downtown area, where conventional bikes are allowed, officials said. And the National Park Service, which operates major bike paths in the region, including the 18-mile Mount Vernon Trail and bans the motorized bicycles, has said that it is tracking what surrounding jurisdictions are doing. In Montgomery County, the six-month pilot will allow e-bikes with speeds up to 20 mph and e-scooters with speeds up to 25 mph on the Rock Creek Trail, Sligo Creek Trail, the Matthew Henson Trail, the Long Branch Trail and the Northwest Branch Trail. Montgomery Parks officials say they will closely monitor their use, keeping an eye for any conflicts with other trail users, to determine whether to permanently remove the ban and expand the new policy to other more popular trails, such as the Capital Crescent Trail. The new e-bike policy coincides with the launch of the e-scooter rentals, the latest phase in the county’s dockless program, which up to now included only bicycles. Montgomery is allowing companies — Lyft, Bird and Lime — to operate as many as 500 e-scooters each. As part of an agreement, the companies will be required to respond to reports of improper parking, monitor sidewalk scooter clutter and ensure that users are no younger than 18. Scooters will not be allowed to be operated on sidewalks. Sandra Brecher, the county’s chief of commuter services, said residents have been asking for the scooter options and the county views the addition of the services as another way to facilitate short trips including first- and last-mile connections to transit. “Our mission is to get people out of their automobiles and into any of the alternatives available,” she said. “We don’t expect people to take a scooter and ride all the way down to downtown D.C., but they can take a scooter and ride to the Metro station or to the nearest bus stop,” she said. Brecher said the county is requiring companies to provide regular and free public training sessions to acquaint users with how to properly use the devices and familiarize them with the rules of the road. She said the education can help reduce incidents involving scooters. A CDC study of scooter injuries recently found that first-time users are more prone to crashes. County transportation officials say their agreement with the companies establishes safeguards to ensure successful, safe and sustainable operations. Among those are performance measures like fleet size and condition, customer information and training on safe and appropriate operations, and quick response time to service requests such as the removal of scooters inappropriately parked. If issues with parking arise, official say, they will work with the companies to identify designated parking areas.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/05/31/montgomery-county-rolls-out-e-scooter-program/
"Skip scooter service suspended in D.C., Arlington and Alexandria after fires",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,6,19,"Skip scooter service suspended in D.C., Arlington and Alexandria after fires. There was a fire at Skip’s D.C. warehouse early Wednesday; city officials also discovered there had been two fires in the fall involving Skip scooters. E-scooter start-up Skip is temporarily pulling its fleet from the District, Arlington and Alexandria, after the District Department of Transportation suspended its operations permit Wednesday in the wake of another fire involving its equipment and revelations of two previously undisclosed fires. The action was prompted by a fire late Tuesday at the company’s D.C. warehouse, the second in a month involving Skip equipment in the city. Upon further investigation, DDOT officials said they learned Wednesday of two additional scooter fires, one in September and another in November. They notified Skip late Wednesday to remove its scooters from city streets within 24 hours. “DDOT’s priority is to maintain the safety of the public space and will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days,” the city transportation agency said in a statement. “The suspension requires that all Skip branded vehicles are removed from the public space in the next 24 hours.” Skip said it was complying with the city order to temporarily suspend service, but it expects to get its scooters back on D.C. streets soon. “This was not an issue with scooters in the field, either deployed or charging,” Skip said in a message to riders Wednesday night. “We are fully cooperating with authorities to ensure a speedy and responsible return to DC.” Skip’s permit allows it to deploy up to 720 scooters in the city, but it’s unclear how many the company has in service. The company started the year with a permit that allowed 600, but it was granted an expansion of 120 in April. Officials in Arlington and Alexandria, where Skip also operates, said the company was in the process of removing the devices from their jurisdictions Thursday. In San Francisco ?the only other market where Skip operates ? officials with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency said the company notified them of the issues in D.C. “We will closely monitor the situation as we move forward with our program here in San Francisco,” SFMTA spokesman Paul Rose said. Eric Balliet, an Arlington County spokesman, said once the scooters “are corrected” the county will have to review and re-approve the company’s participation in its scooter program. Alexandria spokeswoman Sarah Godfrey said the city will review its agreement with the company once it is ready to redeploy. Skip pulled its scooters from D.C. streets for a few days after a scooter burst into flames in downtown Washington on May 30, but it resumed operations June 6. While the cause of that fire was not identified, D.C. officials said Tuesday the scooters had been outfitted with additional safety features, including tamper-resistant battery cages, that they said would help prevent a repeat incident. The fire late Tuesday at the company’s D.C. warehouse renewed the concerns about the safety of the devices that have become a popular option for commuters and tourists to get around the city. DDOT said that it has suspended the company’s permit for at least 30 days, but it’s unclear when and under what conditions the city will allow Skip to resume operations. Skip announced this week’s fire in a tweet. “Our DC warehouse experienced a limited fire which investigators believe to be started in a bin of removed batteries,” the company tweeted. “This was not a scooter fire and it was not a charging-related fire.” The company said it is working with experts to expedite the disposal of used batteries. The storage bin contained batteries removed “as a result of the proper operation of Skip’s quality control process,” the company said. D.C. fire officials on Thursday confirmed three fires at Skip’s scooter facility on K Street NW since the fall, including this week’s. The first, on Sept. 28, involved a scooter being charged. The incident was ruled accidental. The second, on Nov. 22, also involved a scooter, according to dispatch notes, but investigators were not called to the scene. After the May 30 incident — where a scooter caught fire near 14th and I streets NW in front of a Compass Coffee shop — Skip said that it thought it was an isolated case and that its other scooters were safe to ride. D.C. fire and company officials said that fire appeared to have started around the battery pack while the scooter was parked. This week a DDOT spokeswoman said Skip did not “conclusively identify the cause” of the fire but discovered a number of “risk factors” and took steps to address them. DDOT, which regulates the shared e-scooter services, did not explain what those factors are and referred questions to the company. “Before Skip’s scooters were redeployed, DDOT required the company to implement new safety measures that mitigate the risk of a repeat incident,” DDOT said in a statement Tuesday. “As part of the safety protocol, Skip installed tamper-resistant battery cages and monitoring systems on all scooters and will visually inspect each vehicle before it is redeployed. DDOT will continue to monitor performance to ensure the public’s safety. ” Skip said this week that it redeployed its scooters on June 6, after a “thorough investigation” and after taking extra measures to prevent scooter damage. But it did not provide details about those new safety measures, nor did it respond to questions about what could have caused the fire. ""We have added additional fleet management features in our software to help guard against intentional and unintentional damage, which the investigation found to be the probable cause of the incident,” a company statement said. Experts say extra protection for the batteries could be helpful as exposure to dents and shocks, which could happen due to frequent drops, or to extreme temperatures can contribute to overheating. “The scooters can be engineered to withstand many conditions, but it is difficult to cover or anticipate all possible problems,” Virginia Tech professor Louis Madsen said. For example, frequent dropping of a lithium battery can disrupt the alignment and cause it to overheat more. But a fire in one scooter from an entire fleet is probably no cause to worry, as it could just be the work of one faulty battery, Madsen said. The May 30 fire prompted the company to temporarily pull its scooters in the District and San Francisco. It also led to questions about the safety of the devices, which have made headlines in recent months as more people report injuries from riding them. The San Francisco Examiner reported that another Skip scooter caught fire at the company’s San Francisco warehouse in December, just two months after the company launched service there. Skip’s competitor, Lime, one of the world’s largest scooter companies, pulled its scooters out of service last year after discovering that a number of them may have been carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire. Skip is one of six companies operating e-scooters in the District.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/06/19/skip-scooters-are-back-service-back-its-unclear-what-caused-one-burst-into-flames/

The city has told the company to remove its scooters from the streets. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) has suspended the permit allowing San Francisco-based mobility company Skip to deploy electric scooters in D.C., the Washington Post and NBC4 report. The permit suspension, expected to last for at least 30 days, follows a fire at Skip’s District warehouse early Wednesday that the company linked to used batteries. It also comes after a Skip scooter caught fire in downtown D.C. in late May, leading Skip to temporarily pull its electric scooters from service in the District and San Francisco. DDOT, which gave Skip 24 hours Wednesday afternoon to remove the vehicles, told the Post it had also learned of two other Skip-related fires that occurred last fall. Skip’s D.C. permit allows for as many as 720 scooters, out of the nearly 5,000 total shared scooters and bikes allowed currently. (The latter number could grow in the coming months with additional operators.) On Twitter, Skip said it was “fully cooperating” with the fire investigation and is working to accelerate how it disposes used batteries. The storage bin where the fire is believed to have originated “contained batteries removed as a result of the proper operation of Skip’s quality control process,” the company wrote. In a statement, a Skip spokesperson said the operator is complying with DDOT’s suspension order and noted that the fire started in a storage area. “This was not an issue with scooters in the field, either deployed or charging,” they added. “We are fully cooperating with authorities to ensure a speedy and responsible return to DC.” “DDOT’s priority is to maintain the safety of the public space and will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days,” the department told the Post and NBC4 in a statement.

Even more electric scooters coming soon to DC's streets,WUSA,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,7,16,"Even more electric scooters coming soon to DC's streets. DDOT announced Tuesday that it had given conditional approval to three new dockless vehicle operators. Even more electric scooters will soon be coming to D.C.

"Skip scooters to return to service in D.C. with safety revamp, ending suspension following fires",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,8,9,"Skip scooters to return to service in D.C. with safety revamp, ending suspension following fires. Skip is returning its electric scooters to the streets of the District, Arlington and Alexandria this month, ending a six-week suspension of service following two fires involving its equipment. Company officials say they have revamped safety procedures to minimize the likelihood of fires involving damaged batteries, beefed up monitoring and inspections of equipment, and improved employee training. The company acknowledged that past safety lapses contributed to the two fires: one in late May involving a scooter that burst into flames in downtown D.C., and another two weeks later in a bin of batteries at the company’s D.C. warehouse. “We want a flawless safety track record, but we’ve made some mistakes in the past,” the company said in a blog post published Friday. “We didn’t just let our cities and riders down, we let ourselves down.” Skip co-founder and chief executive Sanjay Dastoor said a company investigation found issues with some faulty batteries after the May fire. That led to an inspection of all the equipment and the replacement of some batteries that had sustained damage. But improper disposal of those batteries led to the second fire. The District Department of Transportation suspended Skip’s operations permit on June 19 after those two fires and revelations of two previously undisclosed fires last year. Dastoor said the company determined that the fires resulted from damage — intentional or unintentional — to the battery packs. “We have taken some very important steps to minimize the likelihood that that would happen again,” Dastoor said. “It’s impossible to prevent these things completely and this is true for everything from gasoline cars to electric cars. It doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t be around, but we need the right set of safety standards around them.” He said the company has enhanced operations and audit procedures for handling and disposing of damaged or vandalized equipment. It is increasing monitoring and diagnostics of its scooters and requiring additional safety training for all its warehouse employees. Any damaged batteries, Dastoor said, will be properly disposed of before they show noticeable damage. After the May 30 incident — where a scooter caught fire near 14th and I streets NW in front of a Compass Coffee shop — Skip said the scooters were outfitted with additional safety features, including tamper-resistant battery cages to help prevent a repeat incident. Experts say the extra protection could be helpful because dents and shocks, which can happen because of frequent drops or extreme temperatures, can contribute to the batteries overheating. DDOT director Jeff Marootian said Skip has demonstrated it is taking “clear steps” to ensure it is following best safety practices for the batteries. “After reviewing the revised procedures and finding there will be increased oversight to operation practices, DDOT believes that Skip will be able to operate safely in public space,” Marootian said in a statement. The company is expected to provide more frequent reports to DDOT, which regulates the industry’s operations in the city, to include data on tampering, vandalism, damage, fires and electrical issues. Skip’s permit allows it to deploy as many as 720 scooters in the city, but it’s unclear how many the company has in service. The company started the year with a permit that allowed 600, but it was granted an expansion of 120 in April.

Just How Environmentally Friendly Are All Those Scooters?,DCist,Gothamist,"Washington, DC",2019,9,17,"Just How Environmentally Friendly Are All Those Scooters? DCist is providing special coverage to climate issues this week as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of 250 news outlets designed to strengthen coverage of the climate story. Many of these stories originated as questions from our readers. Eighteen months after the rechargeable, dockless scooters began popping up in the city, they’ve evolved from an oddity to a ubiquitous presence on streets and sidewalks. The District Department of Transportation says seven firms (two others have conditional approval) are operating 4,635 total scooters here. While D.C.’s drivers and pedestrians have complained of obstructed sidewalks and restricted accessibility for the visually or physically impaired, not to mention rider injuries and one fatality last year, scooter companies and transportation advocates say they’re getting more cars off the road—and are starting to amass some data and research to support that narrative. A city-issued 2018 survey in Portland, Oregon, found one in three residents said they’d have driven themselves or taken a ride-hailing service during their last trip if not for the e-scooter they hopped on; the rate was higher among tourists and visitors at 48 percent. The same was true for 50 percent of e-scooter and rentable bike riders in a survey this past winter by the City of Santa Monica. And a study, partially funded by Bird, by two professors from DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development, determined they offer a “preferable alternative” to privately owned autos for trips between half a mile and two miles. The District Department of Energy and Environment declined to comment on e-scooters and carbon emissions, deferring to the District Department of Transportation. DDOT did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Companies have touted their disruptive technology’s green benefits on apps and in marketing materials. Bird notes in a recent PR email that “research shows 30-50 percent of scooter trips would have otherwise been made by car.” Lime says every mile traveled on one of its scooters mitigates 350 grams in carbon emissions. But a first-of-its-kind study published last month in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters casts doubt on that angle by attempting to account for all of the emissions produced in an e-scooter’s life cycle. Calculating carbon output from a single e-scooter in Raleigh—from making its parts to shipping it from overseas to rounding it up and recharging it—North Carolina State University researchers concluded the vehicles produce more emissions per mile traveled than a bus with high ridership, electric mopeds, conventional and e-bicycles and, unsurprisingly, walking. They did find the devices have a smaller carbon footprint than cars. Production was to blame for half of one e-scooter’s emissions, while 43 percent was tied to the charging and redistribution process, which often involves freelance chargers driving around in cars. Researchers also surveyed 61 Raleigh riders and gathered that, had no e-scooters been available at the time of their last trip, 49 percent would have used a bicycle or walked and 11 percent would have ridden the bus, all greener options, they found. Thirty-four percent said they would have the less eco-friendly option of a personal automobile or rideshare. The authors recommended, among other proposals, that companies aiming to cut emissions build longer-lasting scooters and streamline the whole scheme of charging, by incentivizing contractors to use more vehicles with better gas mileage or letting them “claim” e-scooters ahead of time to keep multiple people from driving to the same spot. That part of the study bears out the experience of Alexis Fearing. Hoping to bring in some extra cash, she gave charging e-scooters a shot in in May 2018. Several nights a week, Fearing would grab five or six Birds and squeeze them into her Honda Accord, then drop them off around 6 a.m. the next morning. She called it quits by August, finding the extra $25 to $50 she made daily wasn’t worth the money she spent on fuel, not to mention the wear and tear inside her car. “It was not all that super-lucrative. It started getting more competitive,” she says, noting that competing freelance chargers were beating her to her targeted two-wheelers. “I was using up gas, driving to the scooters, and people were already there.” Outlets quickly picked up on the most damning part of the study’s conclusion—that e-scooters ”do not necessarily reduce environmental impacts from the transportation system.” The MIT Technology Review summed it up as, “Sorry, scooters aren’t so climate-friendly after all.” Companies have some gripes about how the study was conducted, saying it made incorrect assumptions about their business models and didn’t account for steps they’ve already taken to cut emissions in the less-than-two years that e-scooters have been around. Melinda Hanson, Bird’s head of sustainability and environmental impact, said in a statement that “assumptions used in the North Carolina study are not reflective of Bird’s operations.” Case in point, she said, Bird’s scooters are custom-produced, unlike the China-made Xiaomi model researchers used in their calculations. (Bird, Lyft, and Spin, who are licensed in D.C., have reportedly all used Xiaomi scooters at one point; Bird has since moved on to a custom model.) She added that “the study’s comparison cases were also based on assumptions that don’t necessarily reflect what we see in cities today,” like the fact that buses often aren’t 100 percent full. Lime said in a statement that it “welcomes research into the environmental benefits of new mobility options,” but similarly maintained the findings are “largely based on assumptions and incomplete data that produces high variability in the results.” The statement didn’t elaborate, but Lime has already announced it’s purchasing renewable energy credits and carbon offsets to account for electricity used in charging its scooters (as has Bird), and has also already adopted one of researchers’ suggestions in letting “juicers” reserve scooters for 30-minute windows, keeping contractors from duplicating efforts to round them up. But even with these changes, e-scooters largely rely on people driving cars to charge them. One now-former charger from Northeast D.C., who asked to remain anonymous because of a conflict of interest with his day job in transportation research, said he encountered competitors using rented pickup trucks or vans with far more storage capacity. Fearing, who tried out the hustle while living in Bloomingdale, said D.C.’s licensed scooter providers could do more to track chargers’ emissions, including asking them to record their mileage on the job. Both ex-chargers also suggested companies try out a different framework entirely, like bringing the new charge to the scooters instead of having people pick up and drop them off daily. That’s just what Bolt, co-founded by Olympian runner Usain Bolt, is doing by offering swappable, rechargeable batteries in its recently debuted devices. A spokesperson said the firm assigns employees with sprinter-style vans to service the vehicles, rather than allowing chargers to sign up and collect them in their own cars. Skip, which recently returned from an operating suspension in the District after multiple scooters unexpectedly caught fire, is doing something similar by rolling out a new line of devices with replaceable batteries. In a statement, a Skip spokesperson said that the company testing them out in its only other market, San Francisco, before eventually replacing its existing fleet in D.C. this year. “Rather than trucks and vans driving about to pick-up and re-deploy, a single electric cargo bike can make the rounds to replace batteries with a full (and significantly longer) charge,” Skip CEO and founder Sanjay Dastoor said in a statement. And Spin, a Ford-owned company that arrived last fall, is piloting solar-powered docking stations in D.C., in part to eliminate the need for freelancers to come pick them up and charge them overnight. The firm partnered with startup Swiftmile to install 40 total docking stations in busy areas in the District, Alexandria, and Arlington. The idea banks on users taking it upon themselves to dock their scooters to recharge after use, instead of leaving them out on sidewalks. Lime, for its part, said it’s established “a robust repair and reuse program” to make its scooters longer-lasting, and is “making rapid advances in both technology and operations.” Hanson, Bird’s head of sustainability, said the firm is “committed to making Bird a net-zero carbon emission service,” including with those aforementioned renewable energy credits. The company is also exploring other ways to cut emissions and hopes to be able to track its entire carbon footprint, she said. Only two years have passed since the first e-scooters were dropped off on Santa Monica streets, and even less since they arrived in D.C. “It’s moving so fast that I don’t think anyone has the right answers,” says Sebastian Castellanos, research lead for the World Resources Institute’s transportation technology-focused New Urban Mobility alliance. But he points out to the positive finding that was overlooked in numerous reports on that recent life-cycle study—“Even if scooters have a shorter life span,” says Castellanos, “it’s still much better” than cars.",https://dcist.com/story/19/09/17/just-how-environmentally-friendly-are-all-those-scooters/
"More Dockless Scooters, Fewer Operators Under New District Proposal",WAMU,NPR,"Washington, DC",2019,10,1,"More Dockless Scooters, Fewer Operators Under New District Proposal. Dockless scooter devotees may be delighted to see more vehicles zooming around the District next year, but with less variety if the city adopts new draft proposed rules from the District Department of Transportation. Under the rules, which are currently up for public comment, up to 10,000 dockless scooters would be allowed to roam D.C. streets in 2020 — a 60 percent increase from today’s 6,210 permitted limit, Greater Greater Washington first reported. Dockless bikes won’t be left out of the fun either; up to 10,000 also would be permitted, making for a potential 20,000 dockless vehicles on the road. But not every company currently operating in the D.C. market would get to participate. The permit would cut the number of current scooter operators in half, allowing just four companies to deploy between 500 to 2,500 vehicles throughout the day, with no more than 1,000 vehicles allowed in the Central Business District at any point. There are eight dockless scooter companies in the District: Bird, Bolt, Jump (which also operates dockless bikes), Lime, Lyft, Razor, Skip, and Spin. Two other dockless vehicle sharing operators, Hopr and Ridecell, could also enter the ring, both of which operate bicycles and electric scooters. It isn’t clear how DDOT would decide which companies get to stay and which ones have to go. DCist has reached out to DDOT for comment. The new regulations would also require companies to deploy 20 vehicles in each ward by 6 a.m. each morning (current rules only require them to deploy six vehicles). In addition, each operator must also deploy at least 400 vehicles in “Equity Emphasis Areas” — parts of the District that have significant concentrations of low-income and/or minority population groups, as determined by the National Capital Region Planning Board (TPB) in 2017 — within a two-hour time period each morning to help make the dockless scooters more accessible. Dockless vehicles have been operating in the city since DDOT began a pilot program in 2017. While bicycles initially were the main attraction in town, scooters took over the scene last year. The city extended its pilot program several times, and released its first permit requirements for the dockless vehicle program late last year. The new rules are proposed to govern dockless companies in operation in the city next year. Public comments on the new proposal are open until Oct. 7.",https://wamu.org/story/19/10/01/more-dockless-scooters-fewer-operators-under-new-d-c-proposal/
Scooter Companies Offer Discounts to Low-Income Riders,NBC Washington,NBC,"Washington, DC",2019,10,5,"Scooter Companies Offer Discounts to Low-Income Riders. Electric scooters are for everyone, the companies want D.C. residents to know. A number of scooter companies offer discounts to those whose budgets are the tightest. Here's the rundown of scooter company discounts available to people with low incomes. Lime recently partnered with Building Bridges Across the River to sign more people up for its Lime Access plan. ""The Lime Access Plan is something that we see as sort of a pillar of our equity work,"" spokeswoman Laura Miller Brooks said. Some D.C. policymakers see scooters as a way to improve mobility in low-income areas. Under proposed new rules for 2020, scooter companies would be allowed to increase the number of scooters in the city, but would be expected to deploy at least 400 vehicles in Equity Emphasis Areas, including large swathes of Southeast and the westernmost portions of Northeast. Recently, Lime tested placing up to a quarter of its fleet in economically disadvantaged areas of D.C. After analyzing the program, Lime found the demand is there for scooter companies if their release is part of a broader outreach effort. ""We found that scooters can be a really meaningful form of first- [and] last-mile transit connection if there’s adequate supplies,"" Miller Brooks said. Lime doesn't consider itself to be the sole transportation provider for these areas. Rather, Miller Brooks said, they see Lime as just one way that scooter companies can provide mobility to everyone in the city. ""In cities across the U.S. transit has not historically been an equitable system,"" Miller Brooks said. ""There are key gaps and still work to be done but we do see ourselves as a supplement.""",https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/scooter-companies-offer-discounts-for-low-income-riders/2049601/
"Future of scooters in Arlington: Keep program going but improvements needed, report says",Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,10,7,"Future of scooters in Arlington: Keep program going but improvements needed, report says. Love them or hate them, electric scooters and bikes are omnipresent in the D.C. area. While they’re popular and continue to provide commuters with alternatives, improvements to their implementation are needed in Arlington, according to a recent report on the county’s pilot program. One determination found by the Arlington Mobility Lab report is that e-scooters and bikes need to be more evenly distributed among upper- and lower-income areas of the county. That comes from the discovery that many trips start in neighborhoods below the median income level. “Results of the pilot confirm that shared mobility devices are popular, with high number of trips and adoption, they are positively perceived by those who them and could provide sustainability and equity benefits as it increases active transportation and access,” the report said. “Certain aspects of the pilot have shown more mixed results, with inconclusive results as to a clear success or failure in terms of performance. This includes the focus on equity concerns (with a disparity in normalized deployment between North and South Arlington), and the clear communication of rules and regulations to the Arlington community.” Protected bike lanes and infrastructure improvements are also needed. Many riders feel it’s irresponsible to use scooters on the sidewalk but the roads are too unsafe, and residents are concerned about parking and clutter from the program. Here are eight main recommendations presented by Mobility Lab: (1) Accelerate infrastructure investments to address rider and community safety and comfort concerns, while focusing on available route detail data. (2) Continue working on innovative ways to address parking. (3) Create, monitor, and refine equity expectations, going beyond geography. (4) Focus on and invest in communicating the rules and regulations to the public, including riders and nonriders. (5) Continue monitoring operations and requiring complete and robust data from operators. (6) Share results and county initiatives with the public; make the integration of shared mobility devices (SMD) into Arlington an inclusive and interactive conversation. (7) Collect or compile more robust data within and outside the SMD program and mandate periodic evaluation of SMD trends. (8) Undertake additional research or studies including more detailed analysis of specific issues of interest flagged in the pilot evaluation. The report also found that 453,690 trips were taken in Arlington County, for a total of 425,124 miles, between October 2018 and June 2019. The average trip distance was 0.94 miles; 90% of trips were for less than two miles. One striking find: 73% of nonriders who responded to Mobility Lab’s survey did not feel safe as pedestrians around riders. For drivers, 76% of them felt “very uncomfortable to uncomfortable” around riders. Arlington’s pilot program started in September 2018 and has been extended to Dec. 31, 2019.",https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2019/10/future-of-scooters-in-arlington-keep-program-going-but-improvements-needed-report-says/
That scooter ride is going to cost you a lot more,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,10,18,"That scooter ride is going to cost you a lot more. 'It’s more expensive to rent a little electronic scooter than hire an Uber,’ one rider said. Justin Snow had a commuting routine. He’d take Metro to Ballston, then grab a Bird scooter and ride the rest of the way home — a little less than two miles. That last leg of the trip was his favorite — and so was the price, at just a bit more than what he would pay for the bus. But recently he was shocked to learn the quick scooter trip that had cost him $2.80 in April had jumped to $7 in late September. “Now I don’t see this as a commuting option at all anymore because it is outrageously expensive,” said Snow, a 24-year-old government contractor. “It’s more expensive to rent a little electronic scooter than hire an Uber car. It makes no sense.” Scooter companies operating in the Washington region have raised their rental prices, dropping the introductory 15-cents-per-minute rides that were widely appealing in exchange for per-minute charges that range from 24 cents to 39 cents, depending on the company. That’s in addition to the $1 unlocking fee some charge. Experts predict prices may go even higher as companies face more fees from cities and increasing pressure to turn a profit. The price hikes have unsettled riders who have come to depend on the services to commute and are finding the cost of their rides more than doubling in some cases. Bird, one of the first providers in the District, raised its per-minute price to 39 cents from 15 cents. The companies would not discuss their decision to raise prices, but some have hinted that higher rates are necessary to keep operations fluid. All eight companies operating in the District said they offer special packages to make their services more affordable for low-income residents, such as unlimited rides for as low as $5 a month. Bird, the most expensive service, said frequent riders can purchase a monthly membership for $59.99; however, the program is at capacity. “Increasing prices will allow us to improve operations and make sure scooters are available throughout the city,” a Lyft spokesman said. Lyft operates 720 scooters in the District. A Lime spokesman concurred, saying the company increased its price in July “to ensure our scooters are always available when and where riders need them so D.C. residents can continue relying on Lime.” But some riders say the new prices can be comparable to taking Uber Pool and much higher than taking the bus, which costs $2. A 20-minute ride on Bird runs nearly $8.80, plus tax; the same ride is $5, plus tax, on a Jump scooter, the cheapest option. D.C. residents have access to more than 5,200 scooters for rent. New proposed regulations would allow up to 10,000 scooters on city streets starting in January. Scooters also are available in the city of Alexandria and in Arlington and Montgomery counties. Experts say it is not surprising companies are raising prices. As cities have begun to regulate the services, the companies have been required to pay permit and ridership fees, they said. Additionally, there are fines associated with impounded scooters and capital costs to replace vandalized equipment or scooters that reach the end of their life span. Some cities have also begun to require companies to use geofencing technology to ensure greater control over their fleets. All of that costs money, said Sarah Catz, a research associate at the University of California at Irvine’s Institute of Transportation Studies. In addition to growing expenses, she said, companies are feeling more pressure to make a profit. Some, she said, may be using price hikes to steer their customers into monthly passes. “There are all types of costs,” said Catz, who studies the micromobility industry. “I think they are raising prices to maintain financial stability.” Snow said he first noticed an increase in June or July when his $2.80 ride went up to $4.40. Then by late September, he was paying $7 and could no longer justify using Bird. “It’s upsetting,” said Snow, who has gone back to riding the bus. He used Bird almost exclusively because of the company’s wide availability in both the District and Arlington. “I was at the point where I was bringing my helmet to work every day and it was my favorite part of my commute,” he said. “I was very loyal and very excited and happy to use them.” On top of the price increase, the companies were forced to lower the top speed of their devices. For example, Snow used to be able to ride up to 20 mph in Arlington. Now he’s limited to about 12 mph. The slower speeds mean trips take longer and therefore cost more, he said. “There should be a middle ground where it is more expensive than a bus but cheaper than actually taking an Uber or a taxi,” he said. “Maybe I will be completely wrong and people will keep using them, but I know not everyone will be using it at this price.” The companies and some experts say many users will stay for the convenience. “You walk outside and there is a scooter and you can automatically take it. There is no waiting,” Catz said. In the meantime, she said, there are more complaints about the length of time people are waiting for Ubers and stuck in traffic. “There is a convenience factor in taking the scooter, and these companies must be aware of that. A lot of time, they can charge for convenience.” Here’s how scooter companies have changed their prices since they arrived in D.C. Bird. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company rolled out in the District in March 2018, offering scooter rentals for $1 to start and 15 cents per minute. It recently raised its per-minute fee to 39 cents. It is the most expensive service in the District. Bolt. One of the newest scooter companies to enter the D.C. market, Bolt launched in July with rentals at 30 cents a minute, with no unlocking fee. Jump. Uber’s e-scooter company launched in Washington in April. The company already had e-bikes in service in the nation’s capital. With the addition of scooters, it introduced a new pricing structure of 15 cents per minute with no unlocking fee. By June, the price had increased to 25 cents a minute. Lime. One of the original dockless bike companies to operate in the region, Lime began to deploy scooters in the District in March 2018. It launched with a price of 15 cents per minute and $1 unlocking fee but in July raised its price to 24 cents a minute. Lyft. The ride-hailing company added scooters in the D.C. market in October 2018, charging 15 cents per minute, plus a $1 unlocking fee. In August, it raised its per-minute rate to 24 cents. Razor. The company rolled out in region in late August with a price of $1 to start and 24 cents per minute. Skip. Formerly Waybots, Skip was among the first to deploy rental scooters in the Washington area with the original price of $1 to start plus 15 cents per minute. In January, it raised its per-minute price to a quarter. Spin. In late August, the company, owned by Ford, eliminated its $1 unlocking fee but raised the per-minute rate from 15 cents to 29 cents. In Northern Virginia, however, rentals are $1 to start and 25 cents per minute.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/10/18/that-scooter-ride-is-going-cost-you-lot-more/
D.C. residents weigh in on future of e-scooters in the nation’s capital,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,11,4,"D.C. residents weigh in on future of e-scooters in the nation’s capital. At D.C. Council hearing, officials weigh scooter operations and bill that aims to “control” the devices. Nearly two years after electric scooters entered the nation’s capital, residents Monday weighed in with their views on the now-ubiquitous devices. More than two dozen people signed up to speak at a D.C. Council hearing where representatives for some of the eight scooter companies operating in the city highlighted their benefits, from closing gaps in the transit network to replacing cars for short trips. They faced critics armed with a long list of concerns, including that scooters are carelessly parked or ridden on sidewalks, creating hazards for pedestrians, the elderly and people with disabilities, and have made streets more dangerous for all road users. During some of the early-morning testimony, the mother of a child who was struck and seriously injured by a scooter in a park called on the city to ban them altogether. Representatives of some of the city’s nightlife businesses warned against over regulation, saying the scooters are facilitating the transportation of patrons and workers to bars and restaurants. Between the two sides, residents and officials appeared to agree on one thing: there is a lack of enforcement of scooter rules. “Who is enforcing?” Chuck Elkins, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner representing Upper Northwest, told the panel’s transportation committee. “Part of the problem is we have these rules and people know they really don’t have to abide by them.” Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), who chaired the hearing and was the only council member present for the four-hour discussion, said serious concerns about scooters are in part because the technology is so new that the city does not have a scooter culture, resulting “in many users neglecting to follow important safety rules.” “Many scooter users weave in and out of pedestrians on the sidewalk at high speeds, do not follow important safety rules, ride while inebriated, and routinely discard scooters that block pedestrian walkways, private driveways, and handicap accessible ramps,” Cheh said. “Users have also been seen riding with two people on a single scooter, which is both against the rules and extremely dangerous. This bad behavior is not just dangerous to the user, but to the public at large as well.” The debate comes as scooter use appears to be on the rise in the District, one of the first U.S. cities to allow the services, and as the District Department of Transportation moves to establish new rules for the services next year, seeking to reduce the number of operators while doubling the number of scooters on city streets. Residents offered their views on a bill that aims to “control” scooter operations and set rules for where scooters can be parked and establish new speed limits. The legislation would give DDOT the authority to fine operators that fail to address complaints and revoke their operations permit if they consistently fail to abide by the rules. Cheh introduced the proposal in June in part, she said, because scooters have created a “Wild West” environment. Cheh announced at the start of the hearing that following input from residents and business leaders she had dropped a controversial provision in the bill that would ban their use between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Brooke Finland, a Ward 4 resident, urged the city to ban the scooters, recounting how her 8-year-old son was struck by a Lime scooter while playing on a sidewalk. He was hospitalized with serious injuries in what was “a terrifying and emotional experience,” she said. “If your children cannot play safely at the neighborhood park, where can they?” she said, urging the panel that if it doesn’t ban the devices to enforce the rules, including the prohibition of multiple riders on one scooter, require helmet use and enforce the requirement that riders be at least 18. She also lobbied for a ban on scooters in school zones. “Scooters need to be banned from sidewalks,” she said. But she asked: “Is it actually feasible to enforce these rules, are police going to ticket users?” Steven Reichert, a personal fitness trainer who works with the elderly and people with disabilities who struggle to navigate city streets, said city regulations, and the proposal before the council, do not do enough to address the sidewalk conflicts. Cheh’s bill, he said, allows scooters to continue to be ridden on sidewalks outside of the central business district. “It lacks any enforcement mechanism whatsoever, and it doesn’t define liability when accidents occur,” said Reichert, who for months has been documenting badly parked scooters and illegal riding behaviors such as two people riding one scooter or riders ignoring the ban on riding on downtown sidewalks. Some company representatives and scooter supporters warned city officials may be over-regulating and failing to take into consideration the high demand for the devices, even after dark. Representatives from Bird, Lime, Lyft, Skip and Spin offered vague answers to questions about liability waivers and how they ensure users follow the rules of the road and response to citizen complaints. Some said their companies offer incentives for good parking, but acknowledged challenges tracking bad behaviors. “Complaints have definitely gone down over time,” said Hannah Smith, senior manager at Bird. Scooter users and companies spoke against any effort to ban riding on sidewalks citywide, citing a lack of in-road infrastructure where scooter riders would feel safe. “I know the sidewalks are a huge issue, but there are many areas of the city where you cannot safely ride on the road,” said Andrew Shapiro, a frequent scooter user. “You don’t have any other options.” Robert Gardner, Lime’s director of government relations for the Washington region, said the company will continue to urge the council to not be “overly prescriptive and instead to use data to drive decision-making. ” Thousands of city residents rely on scooter services, he said. “It’s critical we don’t stifle their use and continued adoption.” The rules in the council bill mirror some already set by DDOT, which regulates the services. The city agency has established fees for operators and a cap on the number of scooters each company is allowed to deploy. DDOT Director Jeff Marootian told the council that despite the challenges, the agency views scooters and other personal mobility programs as tools to address residents’ travel needs. He said in fiscal 2019, there were nearly 5.3 million trips on shared bikes and scooters in the city. To address concerns about sidewalk clutter and conflicts with pedestrians, he said, the city is creating more on-street parking zones for scooters and bikes. “We require the companies to ensure users know the rules,” Marootian said. He said DDOT opposes Cheh’s proposal to increase the speed limit for scooters to 15 miles per hour from 10 mph on streets or bike lanes and reduce it to 6 mph on sidewalks. “DDOT recommends that there be a single speed limit for these devices, rather than attempting to set distinct speed limits for sidewalk and roadway operation,” Marootian said. DDOT recently announced a plan to limit the number of companies authorized to operate scooters in the city to four, allowing each to deploy as many as 2,500 devices. Under that plan the companies will also have the choice to apply for a separate permit to operate bikes — as many as 2,500 each — for a total of 10,000 bikes citywide. The new guidelines would bring exponential growth to the program that now permits eight companies to operate 5,235 scooters combined. One company, Jump, also operates e-bikes. Nearly 1 in 6 District residents used e-scooters in the past year, according to a recent Washington Post poll, including 6 percent who used them at least a few times a week.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/11/04/residents-lawmakers-debate-future-e-scooters-nations-capital/
"Speeding, riding double, parking anywhere: DC leaders consider regulating electric scooters",Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,11,4,"Speeding, riding double, parking anywhere: DC leaders consider regulating electric scooters. Some drivers hate sharing the road with electronic scooters. Many people have come to rely on them to get around. Now, D.C. leaders are discussing how to curb what many consider the Wild West of commuting. “For these devices to be part of our future plans, the behavior has to be fixed. Scooter users must have safety at the forefront of their minds,” said Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh, chair of the Committee on Transportation and the Environment, in a hearing Monday. “Many scooter users weave in and out of pedestrians on the sidewalk at high speeds, weave in and out of traffic on the road, do not follow important safety rules, ride while they are inebriated and routinely discard scooters that block pedestrians’ walkways, private driveways, and handicapped-accessible ramps,” Cheh said. Integrating the latest mode of transportation has been a challenge, and Cheh said changes are needed so scooter riders can coexist on the streets with cyclists, drivers and pedestrians. Before the council are two bills on the topic to regulate how e-scooters are used in the city. Cheh said the District Department of Transportation has added rules to the terms and conditions that they signed with each electric mobility device operator. “But we need more enforcement, and we certainly need better education than is provided by the terms and conditions,” she said before hearing public comment. Multiple witnesses testified throughout the hearing, but Brooke Finland’s testimony stood out: She was nearly brought to tears recounting how her 8-year-old son was hit by a teenager driving a scooter. “As things currently stand, the electric scooters feel very lawless and unregulated, and underage drivers are taking full advantage of this,” she said. “Take a drive through Tenleytown, when school gets out, and you will see many kids on these scooters — some riding double, some driving on the sidewalk and some on the road.” She added that she doesn’t see any of the teens wearing helmets, and wants scooters banned from school zones. Cheh wants to see enforcement in the city center and anticipates signs will need to be put up asking scooter users walk on the sidewalk in that area. ANC Commissioner Chuck Elkins asked for more stringent education criteria for users to increase safety. He echoed others’ suggestions that a driver’s license should be required and that the minimum age to drive a scooter, 18, should be enforced. Cheh said she hopes to move quickly on the Electric Mobility Devices Amendment Act of 2019 before a surge of e-scooters floods the city next year. Cheh said the council had been told that by the beginning of 2020, there could be up to 10,000 scooters available in the District — “about two times what we have now” — and up to 20,000 by next summer. “So, we need to think about the basics — you know, who can ride, where can they ride, and how fast can they go,” Cheh said. The amendment aims to set a scooter speed limit of 15 mph on the road and 6 mph on the sidewalk. The move “will allow scooter riders to keep up with bikes in bike lanes and feel less compelled to ride on sidewalks,” said resident Mark Sussman. Every morning, D.C. requires that 10% of a scooter company’s inventory be redistributed to each of the city’s eight wards to increase the equality of their use. However, Cheh said, the council needs to address how users are parking the scooters, often haphazardly. “I understand that the DDOT is working on identifying areas … where scooters can be parked so that people can know where to put them,” she said.",https://wtop.com/dc/2019/11/speeding-riding-double-parking-anywhere-dc-leaders-consider-regulating-electric-scooters/

The District Department of Transportation is now taking applications for its 2020 Shared Dockless Vehicle Program, and if vendors take full advantage of the new fleet size limits, the number of dockless scooters and bikes in D.C. will more than double next year DDOT increased the total potential dockless fleet for 2020 to a maximum of 20,000 — 10,000 scooters and 10,000 bikes — up from just over 6,200 allowed currently. The city will also limit the number of operators to four per vehicle type, and cap the number of dockless vehicles each can deploy to 2,500. DDOT also has new plans to address dockless vehicle clutter and illegal sidewalk use by riders. The city will install 100 parking corrals for dockless vehicles, and in a new effort to keep them off sidewalks in the Central Business District, DDOT will be painting stencils on sidewalks identifying them as a “dismount zone.” “The 2020 shared dockless vehicle program is representative of our approach to introducing new transportation options while being responsive to stakeholder feedback,” said DDOT Director Jeff Marootian in a statement. Currently, Jump is the only vendor in the District operating a fleet of dockless bikes. Jump, along with Bird, Bolt, Lime, Lyft, Razor, Skip and Spin, all have fleets of dockless scooters in the city, each with between 600 and 720 scooters. The D.C.

New e-scooter regulations passed in Arlington County,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2019,11,18,"New e-scooter regulations passed in Arlington County. The Arlington County Board’s newly adopted regulations lay out expectations for e-scooter riders and companies, with the hope of providing low-cost mobility in a safe and responsible environment. Motorized scooters and skateboards will be required to have speedometers and achieve a top speed of 15 miles per hour, while e-bicycles can top-out at 20 miles per hour on streets and trails. When operated on public sidewalks, the top speed of all devices is restricted to six miles per hour. However, the devices will not be allowed on sidewalks if a protected bicycle lane is available. In addition, the county is considering whether mobility devices should be banned from certain sidewalks based on how crowded the sidewalks are — in a news release, the county said it will evaluate the Rosslyn- Ballston corridor first, based on it being the most-heavily used during a previous pilot program. As for parking, scooters are required to be parked against a sign or light pole, in a rack, or parked along the curb or at the back edge of a sidewalk, where they are not obstructing pedestrians. The county says it will install corrals on streets and will encourage riders and companies to deploy and park scooters there, rather than on sidewalks.

"Bolt, Bird, Lime, And Razor Scooters Will Be Off D.C. Streets In 2020",DCist,Gothamist,"Washington, DC",2019,12,3,"Bolt, Bird, Lime, And Razor Scooters Will Be Off D.C. Streets In 2020. The District Department of Transportation has cut the number of scooter operators in the District in half for next year, granting permits to just four dockless scooter companies: Jump, Lyft, Skip, and Spin. That means that four scooter operators that currently have thousands of vehicles on D.C. streets will no longer be able to operate in the District next year. Say goodbye to Bird, Lime, Razor, and Bolt scooters (the latter are part of Usain Bolt’s mobility company). DDOT announced its decision on Tuesday. It’s in line with the new permit applications the agency released for public comment back in October and confirmed the following month: up to 10,000 scooters would be permitted for 2020, a near 60 percent increase from the previous limit, but only four scooter operators would be granted permits. But even if the pared down number of operators isn’t surprising, it will likely come as a shock to many dedicated scooter-riders to hear exactly which companies they’re losing. Some of the companies DDOT left out have had a huge presence in the District from the very beginning of its dockless vehicle pilot program, most notably Lime. If you’ve walked around the city for any length of time over the last two years, you know precisely what those lime green scooters look like. Black Bird scooters have been equally ubiquitous. As they’ve become increasingly popular, the scooters have become the center of some controversy around safety. Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh introduced legislation earlier this year that would cap scooter speed at 10 miles per hour and prevented riders from using scooters at night (Cheh ultimately walked back the latter regulation). Scooter operator Skip (which received a permit) was suspended for a few months this year after a scooter caught fire on the sidewalk and other fires occurred in the company’s downtown warehouse. (In another incident, a Skip scooter literally exploded in a resident’s backyard.) DDOT also approved two dockless electric bike operators for next year: HelBiz (a new operator for the District) and Jump, which is the only company that will be operating both bikes and scooters in the city. Each scooter operator will be allowed an initial number of up to 2,500 scooters on the street, which makes for a potential total of 10,000 electric scooters in operation D.C. The two bike operators will also be allowed 2,500 vehicles, making for a potential 5,000 dockless electric bikes in the city next year. Per DDOT, the agency received a total of 19 dockless vehicle permit applications for next year: five for bikes and 13 for scooters. Four of the applications were immediately disqualified because the vehicle they were peddling didn’t qualify as a “personal mobility vehicle,” as DDOT defines it. The agency then scored each remaining company on a 198-point scale, with a minimum of 121 points needed to be considered for a permit, per DDOT. The four highest-scoring companies got a 2020 permit. In the next few months, DDOT is going to begin installation of 100 parking corrals for dockless scooters and bikes, which will be located off the sidewalk and out of the way, per the agency’s press release.",https://dcist.com/story/19/12/03/bolt-bird-lime-and-razor-scooters-will-be-off-d-c-streets-in-2020/

This will be the third city for HelBiz bikes, in addition to Milan and Rome, Italy. Though headquartered in New York, D.C. will be the first U.S. market for HelBiz bikes, according to its website. Lyft, Skip and Spin will all continue to operate scooters in the District. DDOT is in the process of installing 100 off-sidewalk parking corrals for dockless scooters and bikes in all eight wards in D.C. to address sidewalk and neighborhood clutter complaints, and all operators have agreed to data collection to monitor compliance and plan for the future. “The District’s 2020 dockless vehicle sharing program is rooted in thoughtful expansion, program evaluation and feedback from stakeholders,” said DDOT director Jeff Marootian. The D.C. Council is currently considering bills to further regulate how e-scooters are used in the city; those are likely to come up for debate and votes next year.",https://wtop.com/business-finance/2019/12/10000-scooters-5000-e-bikes-approved-for-dc-streets-in-2020/
Scooters No Longer Allowed on Sidewalks in Alexandria,Alexandria Living,,"Washington, DC",2019,12,16,"Scooters No Longer Allowed on Sidewalks in Alexandria. Phase II Pilot Program for dockless mobility includes new rules for scooters. Scooters are no longer allowed on sidewalks in Alexandria. That was the outcome of the Saturday City Council meeting, when council voted to move forward with Phase II of the Dockless Mobility Pilot Program. The Phase II Pilot Program will run through December 2020 with much stricter requirements, no sidewalk usage and new speed limits for street usage. The City is also strongly encouraging scooter riders to wear helmets. Changes implemented during the first phase of the pilot program in 2019 have helped — there are fewer scooters along the waterfront thanks to geofencing and more people are using the available parking corrals. Among the changes to scooter usage rules in 2020: No scooters on sidewalks in the City of Alexandria. Scooter companies must distribute scooters more equitably throughout the city, and must use parking corrals when they are available. One rider per scooter. A Dockless Mobility Evaluation Report released by the City on November revealed five key findings. According to the report: Scooters have provided increased access and mobility in Alexandria. Scooters are a new form of mobility and safe riding is a concern. Improper scooter parking can disrupt the pedestrian right of way and impede ADA access. Scooters could improve transportation equity but new policy is needed. The program recouped costs but modifications to management will minimize City financial and staff resources. Residents are invited to continue to email dockless.mobility@alexandriava.gov with feedback on scooter usage. The popularity of scooters in Alexandria prompted Fairfax County to write its own regulations, including rules on usage.

The nightmare of D.C.’s sidewalks,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,12,20,"The nightmare of D.C.’s sidewalks. Howard Marks is the founder of Take Back Our Sidewalks. My wife and I moved to the District 14 years ago searching for a walkable city with a robust public transportation system. Because my wife and I both were working downtown, we bought a condo near the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. We both were able to walk to work. It was safe and convenient. After all, the District was considered one of the most walkable cities in America. Fourteen years later, the pedestrian paradise has turned into a nightmare in the Chinatown neighborhood where we now live. Without any meaningful citizen participation, the District Department of Transportation agreed to allow eight battery-powered, dockless, electric scooter companies to operate in the city in September 2017. There appears to have been no effort to seek feedback or learn from other cities that were already using e-scooters. The safety of riders and pedestrians seemed to be a low priority. Thousands of the e-scooters flooded the District, with most winding up in the Central Business District where I live. These e-scooters were a far cry from the well-managed Capital Bikeshare with its docking stations neatly tucked away without interfering with pedestrians. The chaos permitted by DDOT is evident to me daily. It starts before dawn when the e-scooters are dropped off by contractors in front of my building at Seventh and H streets NW. Often, the e-scooters block the bus stop at the busy Gallery Place-Chinatown Metro station. Metrobus passengers in wheelchairs and using crutches struggle to board some of the most popular bus routes in the city. Hardest hit are the sight-impaired who must use their canes to maneuver around the e-scooters. DDOT’s actions are clearly inconsistent with the spirit of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Later in the day, it gets worse. Convention-goers and tourists begin to rent the e-scooters. Warnings to use helmets go unheeded, and new users hop on the narrow e-scooter platforms with no training as to how they work. Not infrequently, they load up the kids and ride double. They then set off at speeds of up to 10 miles per hour on the narrow and crowded and bumpy sidewalks of downtown. We don’t know exactly how many people have been injured or killed by e-scooters because of poor record-keeping by DDOT and the companies. However, just a few days before Thanksgiving, a 16-year-old e-scooter rider was killed by a tow-truck operator in Elizabeth, N.J. Collecting damages from the e-scooter companies is virtually impossible because of the terms in one-sided multipage documents to which all riders must agree, waiving the right to sue the company. As a senior citizen, I have been frequently frightened by e-scooters approaching from behind with no warning bells or whistles. A member of the coalition I founded, Take Back Our Sidewalks, carries a small dome mirror when she walks to scan behind her to avoid being hit by an e-scooter. Dogs and dog walkers are particularly at risk of being struck because the dogs can move suddenly into the path of a scooter, with the dog walker dragged along by the leash. Incredibly, DDOT Director Jeff Marootian promises doubling the number of permitted e-scooters to as many as 10,000 next year. Ward 3 D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D) has introduced legislation to begin tightening the regulation of these scooters. Members of Take Back Our Sidewalks testified at a hearing on the legislation. We are hoping the legislation will be greatly strengthened and then pass the D.C. Council and be signed by the mayor. Opposition to commercial e-scooters is mounting here and elsewhere. They are banned in Manhattan, New Orleans, Boston and Chicago. Paris restricts sidewalk use, and Singapore recently stopped their operation on sidewalks after at least one death. Take Back Our Sidewalks is dedicated to educating public officials and citizens on the dangers of e-scooters and seeking sensible regulation of their use to protect pedestrians. The first order of business will be to impose a moratorium on any further expansion of the e-scooter fleet in the District pending study by an independent safety organization of means to restore safety to our sidewalks.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/local-opinions/the-nightmare-of-dcs-sidewalks/2019/12/20/a23f2f72-17b0-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html
D.C.’s planned expansion of e-scooter services is paused,Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2019,12,23,"D.C.’s planned expansion of e-scooter services is paused. The District is holding off on changes for 2020 while it reviews appeals from excluded scooter companies. Users of some of the most popular electric scooter services in the nation’s capital won’t have to worry about those scooters going away in the new year. The District will allow all eight scooter companies operating in the city this year to continue their operations at least through March 31. But the decision also puts on hold the city’s biggest planned expansion of the e-scooter program. The District earlier this month had selected four of the eight companies to deploy as many as 10,000 scooters in the new year, nearly twice as many as are available today. But some of the companies that were left out of the program challenged the city’s selection method and sought to appeal. The District Department of Transportation said Friday it will consider “all valid appeals” submitted no later than Jan. 2 and will issue a final decision on the program by Feb. 28. In the meantime, all 2019 permit holders will get a three-month extension to operate in the city. In early December, DDOT selected Uber’s Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin to continue operations under the 2020 permit, allowing each company to deploy as many as 2,500 scooters starting Jan. 1 for a total of 10,000 scooters, or nearly double the number of devices currently available for rent in the city. In addition, the city issued two permits for e-bike operations to allow a total of 5,000 e-bikes beginning Jan. 1. Scooter companies Lime and Bird, two of the early entrants into the scooter scene in the District and nationwide, and Bolt and Razor, which had arrived in the city more recently, didn’t make the cut. Some of those companies challenged DDOT’s scoring system and selection process. An interagency committee rated the applications on a 198-point scale and selected the top point-earners, officials said. The scoring evaluated factors including innovation, safety, labor practices, dedication to accessibility and accountability. Successful applicants had to earn a minimum of 121 points, but only the four highest-scoring applicants were granted 2020 permits. Bird, Lime and Razor all secured more than 121 points but ranked below their competitors. Executives with Bird and Lime said they are pleased with the extension and appeal review. “We look forward to continuing our conversations with the city and remain committed to providing sustainable, safe transportation to residents of the District of Columbia,” a Bird spokeswoman said. Robert Gardner, Lime’s director of government relations for the Washington region, said in an email: “We are eager to continue providing district residents with the high-quality service they have come to expect from Lime. We are committed to DC and will continue to explore our options to serve the city beyond March.” Bird and Lime, which rolled out their scooters in D.C. in March 2018, had touted their roots in the region and gains in building community connections to make their services more accessible citywide. Even though the companies have a presence in other parts of the region, the District is their busiest market. It is unclear how DDOT will evaluate the appeals and whether the process will lead to the agency’s including more companies than the four already selected. City officials had said having a smaller number of operators would allow for better oversight and response to public complaints about issues such as badly parked scooters. It also would make the program more manageable for users who wouldn’t have to navigate among multiple apps to find their next ride. Some people familiar with the discussions say the agency could end up adding more operators and changing the share of vehicles each company can operate in the 10,000 cap. The companies operating during the extension period will continue to abide by the 2019 rules, DDOT said, keeping existing fleet size maximums and paying fees per device on the ground. The eight companies operate up to 5,235 scooters combined. The two e-bike permits for 2020 will go into effect in January as planned. Those permits allow Jump and HelBiz, a new company to the District, to deploy up to 2,500 e-bikes each.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/12/23/dcs-planned-expansion-e-scooter-services-paused/
DC officials announce 100 new bike and scooter parking zones,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2020,1,25,"DC officials announce 100 new bike and scooter parking zones. The growth of bikeshare and electric scooter companies across D.C. has made getting around without a car so much easier — but it’s also meant finding dockless scooters and bikes strewed across streets and sidewalks. Now, the District Department of Transportation has hopes your days of tripping over the scooter someone left in the middle of the sidewalk will soon be over. The city plans to build 100 off-sidewalk corrals for dockless bikes and scooters in all eight pf D.C.’s wards during the coming months. And since they’re off-sidewalk, that means they’ll be going on the street. But DDOT said that doesn’t mean a reduction of available parking in your neighborhood. The corrals will be built adjacent to intersections, putting to use the space between the stop sign and where residential parking zones begin — areas you’re not supposed to park your car in anyway. DDOT said the corrals will have the added benefit of preventing illegal parking in that zone, improving visibility at crosswalks and intersections. Commuters will be allowed to park their personal scooters and bikes in the corrals, as well as picking up and dropping off for-rent, dockless vehicles. The District said these corrals should also serve as natural vehicle deployment points for electric scooter and bikeshare companies. This is the second phase of DDOT’s off-sidewalk corral installation, which emphasizes residential neighborhoods with narrow sidewalks easily blocked by an improperly parked e-scooter or e-bike. The corrals were first piloted in business improvement districts and commercial areas where officials anticipated high volumes of dockless vehicle traffic.",https://wtop.com/dc/2020/01/ddot-new-parking-for-scooters-bikes/
Arlington Reveals ‘No Scooter’ Zones,ARLnow,,"Washington, DC",2020,2,10,"Arlington Reveals ‘No Scooter’ Zones. By the end of the month, Arlington County will start posting signs making it clear where e-scooters and e-bikes are not welcome. The county today revealed that the sidewalks along nine different stretches of road, in six Arlington neighborhoods, will be off-limit to scooters and similar personal mobility devices. That follows the November passage of an ordinance allowing e-scooter and e-bike operation in the county, following a temporary pilot program. The new no-go zone for scooters and the like, deemed “key sidewalk conflict areas,” are: Ballston: North Quincy Street between North Glebe Road and 9th Street North, westbound Fairfax Drive between North Glebe Road and North Wakefield Street Court House: North Veitch Street between Wilson Boulevard and Lee Highway Crystal City: South Eads Street between 12th Street South and 22nd Street South, and between Fort Scott Drive and South Glebe Road Lyon Park: North Pershing Drive between Washington Boulevard and North Barton Street Pentagon City: Army Navy Drive between South Nash Street and South Joyce Street, South Hayes Street between 15th Street South and 18th Street South Rosslyn: Westbound Wilson Boulevard between North Oak Street and North Courthouse Road “Later this month, new signage prohibiting sidewalk-riding will be installed next to protected bicycle lanes, where people biking are separated from drivers with a parking lane or other physical barrier,” Arlington County said in a press release. “When a protected bike lane is available in the same direction of travel, shared e-scooter and e-bike riders must use it instead of the sidewalk.” “Signage will be placed at the start of a sidewalk where sidewalk-riding is banned,” the press release said. “Initial enforcement of the new restrictions will focus on education and warnings.” The county is now evaluating other stretches of sidewalk that are not next to protected bike lanes for possible scooter prohibition, “in the interest of public safety and welfare.” Arlington has set up a website — ridedockless.com — that lists information about e-scooter and e-bike riding in the county, including rules, parking etiquette and info for businesses.",https://www.arlnow.com/2020/02/10/arlington-reveals-no-scooter-zones/
"Bird, Lime, Bolt, And Razor Scooters To Leave D.C. After Unsuccessful Appeals",DCist,Gothamist,"Washington, DC",2020,2,27,"Bird, Lime, Bolt, And Razor Scooters To Leave D.C. After Unsuccessful Appeals. The District’s Department of Transportation has made a final decision on which four scooter companies will operate in the city come April 1: Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin. That’s the original list of companies DDOT said it would issue 2020 permits to late last year. But then, facing frustration from operators that didn’t make the cut, the department allowed unsuccessful companies to appeal the decision, and extended their permits until the end of March. “We wanted to make sure that companies who were not selected as part of the initial review had an opportunity to appeal the decision, to have an independent review of their application to make sure it was scored and evaluated fairly,” said DDOT Director Jeff Marootian. But none of those appeals were successful. Bird, Lime, Bolt and Razor — companies that have scooter fleets in D.C. — will now have to close up shop in April. “The conclusion of the hearing officer was that the overall process was fair,” said DDOT Director Jeff Marootian. On the original permit application, companies were scored on a 198-point scoring system. 25 percent of the score dealt with companies’ “historical behavior,” and the rest looked at the company’s future operational plans, education and equity proposals, and data collection and protection methods. Some companies that didn’t make the cut have raised questions about the rubric. Published results from the permit application process show, for instance, that Lime received the highest score for its track record in the District — but didn’t ultimately secure a 2020 permit. “We’re disappointed with this decision and will continue to explore our options to keep serving D.C. residents,” a spokesman for Lime said in an emailed statement. And one company that will continue operating in D.C. doesn’t have a spotless safety record. Over the summer, a number of Skip scooters caught fire, prompting DDOT to temporarily order the company to suspend its operations in D.C. for 30 days while Skip performed an internal safety audit. The company’s examination found that the culprit was faulty lithium batteries. Nevertheless, Marootian was confident that the scooter operators selected in the 2020 permit process were up to standard. “Safety is the most important component of this program,” he said. “Companies were evaluated not only on their past safety performance but also on their plans to ensure the safety of riders in the future.” In fact, the original reason DDOT decided to scale back the number of scooter companies operating in the District, Marootian told WAMU, is to allow the department to provide better oversight. That includes equipment testing conducted by the department. “We know that by limiting it to four companies, we’re able to better manage the program, allow those companies to add more scooters, but also to make sure that the public is safe, that our sidewalks are clear, and that we have a well-managed scooter micromobility process going forward,” he said. The four successful companies — Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin — will now be able to scale up significantly. Each operator will be able to put 2,500 vehicles on D.C. streets, for a total of 10,000 scooters in the city. Currently, the operators have fewer than 1000 scooters apiece. As for the other companies that will now have to end their D.C. operations? Marootian said DDOT would re-evaluate the program again at the end of this year, and there would be a chance to re-apply.",https://dcist.com/story/20/02/27/bird-lime-bolt-and-razor-scooters-to-leave-d-c-after-unsuccessful-appeals/
"Lime, Bird, three others lose appeals to operate scooters in D.C.",Washington Post,Washington Post,"Washington, DC",2020,2,27,"Lime, Bird, three others lose appeals to operate scooters in D.C. The decision by the District Department of Transportation means only Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin can operate in the city. The scooter companies Lime and Bird will have to leave the District come April 1 after losing their appeals to continue operating in the city. The District Department of Transportation announced in December that it had selected four of the eight companies that had been operating in the city to continue providing service under its revised e-scooter program. Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin won bids to deploy a combined total of up to 10,000 scooters in the city. Lime and Bird appealed the decision, as did three other companies — Helbiz, Wheels and Clevr Mobility — who had hoped to operate in the District. Neither Bolt or Razor, which had been operating in the city, choose to appeal the decision. Bolt stopped operating at the end of December, when its permit expired, and Razor will cease operations at the end of March. “Having fewer companies enables us to more effectively manage the program and create an easier user experience for people who are hoping to access these,” DDOT Director Jeff Marootian said in explaining the decision. “We’re obviously disappointed by the ruling and are actively exploring ways to continue serving District residents in 2020,” a Lime spokesman said. “We’re proud of our partnership we’ve enjoyed with the District, the community organizations we support, and our performance as the longest-serving operator in the city.” Since their arrival in 2017, scooters have become a popular option for those looking for an easy way to move around the District, which was one of the first U.S. cities to allow the services to operate. And while the two-wheeled vehicles have their share of detractors, there is no sign they are going away. In October, the city announced plans to reduce the number of scooter operators in the District to four. Four slots were also set aside for e-bike operators. Thirteen scooter companies and five e-bike companies applied, according to DDOT. An interagency committee evaluated the applications on a 198-point scale and selected the top point-earners — Jump, Lyft, Skip and Spin. The selection of Skip raised some eyebrows after one of its scooters caught fire last summer. The company suspended operations for six weeks and acknowledged that past safety lapses had contributed to the scooter fire downtown and another at its warehouse involving batteries. The city allowed the company to resume operating in August, saying it had demonstrated that it was taking “clear steps” to ensure it was following best safety practices. Under the new rules, the four companies can apply to expand their fleets on a semiannual basis. DDOT says it will grant expansions after evaluating a company’s performance. For example, a company that starts with 2,500 scooters in April could potentially have 5,000 in service. If all four companies were to be approved for the maximum expansion, there could be 20,000 scooters operating in the city. As part of their agreement to operate in the District, the companies must allow DDOT to install GPS trackers on a random sample of devices for research purposes and also must report within 24 hours any issue that could affect public safety. That includes criminal activity, traffic crashes and fires involving their devices. The scooter companies also will be required to provide scooters in all eight wards of the city and will be limited to a maximum of 1,000 vehicles in the central business district. The 2020 permit increases to 20 the minimum number of vehicles that must be deployed in each ward by 6 a.m. daily and establishes “equity” zones, primarily east of the Anacostia River, where companies will be required to deploy at least 400 vehicles for use during the morning rush hour. As part of the effort to better manage complaints of scooters cluttering sidewalks, DDOT officials announced last month they are installing 100 off-sidewalk parking corrals for e-scooters and bicycles. The corrals will be placed in the area between stop signs and the start of parking zones to ensure that illegally parked cars do not block the visibility of crosswalks and intersections. The corrals were first piloted in business-improvement districts and commercial areas where there were large numbers of dockless vehicles. The new locations will be placed in residential areas where sidewalks are narrower and more likely to be blocked when dockless scooters or bikes are left on them.

Bike and scooter-sharing companies implement new cleaning practices amid coronavirus outbreak,Wtop news,CBS,"Washington, DC",2020,4,2,"Bike and scooter-sharing companies implement new cleaning practices amid coronavirus outbreak. On a normal day, thousands of people use shared bikes and scooters to get around D.C. and suburban neighborhoods. With concerns about the coronavirus prompting stay-at-home orders in place for the foreseeable future, ridership is down. Despite that, the companies all say they will continue normal operations, for now. As a result of World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the companies have modified their cleaning and sanitizing protocols, and they’ve also added new safety practices. Here’s a compilation of what some of the shared transport providers are doing during the coronavirus outbreak: Capital Bikeshare Capital Bikeshare is disinfecting high-contact surfaces each time a bicycle is returned to the company depot. Bikes at docking stations are being cleaned, with a special focus on high-traffic stations. Transport vans are disinfected at the start of each shift. In addition, Capital Bikeshare has temporarily closed a number of stations surrounding the Tidal Basin and National Mall. Helbiz Helbiz, which is new to D.C., is implementing cleaning procedures similar to Capital Bikeshare, adding that it’s taking every safeguard to ensure the safety of its employees. JUMP JUMP by Uber operates both bicycle and scooter-sharing in D.C. The company said it has increased how often employees clean its bicycles and scooters. Uber said it’s also disinfecting all JUMP vehicles going to and from its warehouses. “Staff responsible for handling JUMP vehicles are wearing gloves and washing their hands often. We will be vigilant in our cleaning process, but we also encourage riders to clean the handles of their vehicle before and after use (for instance, with a disinfectant wipe),” said Susan Hendrick, a spokeswoman at Uber, in a statement to WTOP. The company is urging as many people stay at home as possible during the coronavirus pandemic. Lyft Lyft scooters are disinfected each time vans transport the vehicles and when scooters are docked for recharging. Employees wear gloves at all times when cleaning and disinfecting. Skip Skip operates shared scooters and it said it’s following health guidance from the CDC, the World Health Organization and local authorities. Spin Spin increased the frequency of its scooter fleet disinfection, with a particular focus on the upper-mast and handlebars. Work spaces within Spin are cleaned daily.

The District Department of Transportation suspended Capital Bikeshare service and asked micro-mobility companies to remove their scooters from the streets as a safety precaution ahead of the third night of protests. The changes are unusual, but a DDOT spokesperson says the decision was made early Sunday morning at the request of law enforcement after the protests rapidly evolved into looting late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. According to DDOT, the Metropolitan Police Department said scooters were being used as projectiles during Saturday’s protest. MPD and the office of D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser did not respond to requests for comment. At least one scooter was seen just outside a smashed window of a business in Georgetown this morning. “At the point where it is a safety issue, we listen to the safety professionals,” a DDOT spokesperson tells WAMU. Four scooter companies current operate in the District: Spin, Lime, Lyft, and Skip. Moped company Revel also temporarily shut down in response to the DDOT order. Robert Gardner, public relations officer for Lime, confirmed the company has removed its scooters from the city in response to an order from DDOT: “We take public safety seriously and will continue to be in touch with the City about redeployment.” The bikes were only removed from the District. DDOT partners with six other jurisdictions on the bikeshare, but bikes were available in Virginia and Maryland cities. Meanwhile, Bowser has instituted a citywide curfew beginning at 11 p.m. Sunday. Some residents said the suspension affected their ability to get to the protest. DDOT’s other service, the Circulator bus and Streetcar are still operating, as is WMATA buses and trains.

"Shareable, electric scooters infiltrate downtown Denver Friday to riders’ delight and the city’s concern ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,5,25,"Shareable, electric scooters infiltrate downtown Denver Friday to riders’ delight and the city’s concern. City of Denver “concerned” about the dockless scooters that cost $1 to unlock via app and 15 cents per minute to use. A few hundred electric scooters were set free in Denver Friday and curious folks didn’t waste time before hopping aboard and navigating the sea of small dogs, activists asking for petition signatures and lunch breakers downtown. Lime, known for its Aurora bikeshare program, is giving the people of Denver what they never knew they wanted: a fleet of shared, dockless electric scooters that cost $1 to unlock via app and 15 cents per minute to zoom around town. Sam Sadle, Lime director of strategic development in Denver, said the company is on a mission to help the city achieve its goal of getting 30 percent of in-town traffic out of vehicles by 2030. “So far, Denver has only reached 13 percent nonvehicle travel,” Sadle said. “By taking cars off the roads and replacing them with scooters, we believe we can alleviate traffic congestion, help Denver reach its Vision Zero goals, improve urban mobility and transform the way people get around the city.” Hit the brake on that scooter, the City of Denver says. “While Denver Public Works is supportive of new alternative transportation options, we feel these technologies should be deployed in a way that works with the city’s goals of increasing pedestrian safety and mobility,” Public works spokeswoman Nancy Kuhn said in an emailed statement. “We were not notified of LimeBike’s plans to deploy in our community today until a couple of days ago.” The city is concerned about the use, placement and number of scooters operating on Denver’s sidewalks, particularly in high-pedestrian traffic zones. “Our department will be removing scooters that are blocking sidewalks and other public spaces,” the statement read. “At the same time, we are working to develop new rules to regulate these activities in the public right of way that we aim to put into effect in the very short-term.” Sadle said he doesn’t think it’s worth the time or effort to impound the scooters. “We want to work with the city, and we hope they’ll be willing to work with us.” While there may be tension between Lime and the city of Denver, residents walking the streets on Friday afternoon were delighted by the devices parked outside Mutiny Information Cafe along Broadway. The handful of scooters near the cafe were part of a roll-out of a few hundred scattered around downtown, Five Points, LoDo, and along East Colfax Sadle said. Kristina Hall and Clint Mitchell zipped around the block, parking their temporary steeds outside of Sweet Action Ice Cream while they dug into an afternoon treat. “Riding them around is like being in Europe,” Mitchell said. “It’s like we’re on vacation, except we live here.” Mitchell needed some convincing before entrusting his life to a two-wheeled, motorized contraption that would fly down a busy city sidewalk, but once Hall cajoled him, he was hooked. “I’m so glad I did this,” Mitchell said. “It was just fun, and I love that you can drop it anywhere.” Brandon Gayeski was on his lunch break when he and some colleagues came across a pod of scooters. “I was just in San Diego where they have these, and they were awesome,” Gayeski said. “I think they’ll be super popular. I like showing up in style.” Gayeski said he could imagine going out for the night and using the scooter to get around downtown rather than taking an Uber or Lyft. “It’s way cheaper,” he said. Anthony Gengaro, with the Metro Denver Local Redevelopment Corp., said this is exactly the kind of public transportation progress that’s needed in the city. “It’s kind of like you just put them in the public realm and now see what happens,” Gengaro said. Once interested users unlock the dockless scooter through a phone app, hop aboard and push off into the bustling world, the Lime scooter offers a throttle to accelerate the device and a hand brake to stop. You can get scooting up to a cool 14.8 mile per hour maximum speed, whizzing past those making do with their slower, however free, legs. The scooters can roll more than 20 miles before running out of charge, according to the Lime website. Among the rules listed on Lime’s electric scooter rundown: you have to be at least 18 to scoot; you need to have a driver’s license; helmets are encouraged; parking curbside is considered proper. And sorry thrill-seekers, no stunt riding is allowed. “This is going to be helpful for areas of our city that still lack access to bike share programs. And fun,” Denver District 3 councilman Paul Lopez said.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/05/25/electric-scooters-denver-lime/
"Yes, you can get a DUI on a Lime scooter (Denver)",9 News,NBC,"Denver, CO",2018,5,29,"Yes, you can get a DUI on a Lime scooter. Denver Public Works, meanwhile, is trying to develop regulations for things like Lime scooters. If you happened to be in downtown Denver this weekend, you might have noticed a few hundred green, motorized residents that have descended on the town and are either the best or worst things to have ever happened to the Mile High City. No, we’re not talking about Californians (that was a joke, don’t @ me). Instead, we’re talking about Lime scooters. And if your weekend travels happened to take you to areas such as the breweries in River North, you might have considered the possibility that some of the folks who paid $1 to unlock these new transportation devices (and $0.15 for each ensuing minute) might have had something to drink. So, we asked the Denver Police Department the obvious question: can you get a DUI on a Lime scooter? Sgt. Josh White said yes. It’s just like how you can get a DUI on a bike. Of course, this led to more questions: has anyone actually been arrested or cited for riding a Lime scooter under the influence? Have there been any reported injuries? DPD said they’d try to find out and get back to us. We sent an email with multiple follow-up questions and will post a follow-up report. But in the meantime, take this as a warning: don’t drink and ride Lime scooters. For what it’s worth, Lime scooters can only be ridden on the sidewalks, and not in the bike lanes or streets unless they’re crossing an intersection, according to Denver Public Works. Denver Public Works said it will remove scooters left in the middle of the sidewalk, so park them appropriately. The department also said the city is developing new rules to regulate activities like the scooter-sharing service and it aims to put them into effect in the very short term.",https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/yes-you-can-get-a-dui-on-a-lime-scooter/73-559639789
LimeBike E-Scooters Land In Denver After ‘Begging For Forgiveness’ In Other Cities,Colorado Public Radio,NPR,"Denver, CO",2018,5,31,"LimeBike E-Scooters Land In Denver After ‘Begging For Forgiveness’ In Other Cities. Where were you when the scooters arrived? The fleet of a couple hundred bright-green electric scooters took Denver streets by storm Friday, May 25. Created by dockless bike share company LimeBike, the scooters offered a cheap ($1 to start, 15 cents per minute thereon out) and car-free transit opportunity. But while some were delighted by the Memorial Day weekend surprise, others saw chaos as the scooters launched without city permission, clogged sidewalks and blocked driveways. Denver isn't the first city to reckon with the two-wheeled invaders, Curbed reporter Patrick Sisson said. Three scooter companies set up shop in Sisson's homebase, San Francisco, also without receiving explicit permission: Bird and Spin in addition to LimeBike. In San Francisco, the city has required the three companies to pull their scooters from the streets by June 4 as they establish a permit program. They also launched without permission in Austin, where the scooters were impounded and only returned to the streets earlier this month. ""I think I’d liken it to the Uber model,"" Sisson said. ""It’s sort of a situation where they're begging for forgiveness, not asking for permission."" Fox 31 reports that Denver has started to take similar action as it confiscates scooters that block sidewalks or public spaces. And residents in multiple cities have started to publicly shame bad scooter etiquette with the hashtag, #ScootersBehavingBadly. Many scooters are inconveniently or even illegally parked because of a lack of infrastructure that encourages street riding. That public transportation reality often butts heads with people's desires for car-free transit options. ""On one hand, yes, these scooters are responding to a desire for a multi-model transportation. That’s something people really want,"" Sisson said. ""The flip side to this is, cities really aren’t prepared for this."" It's a problem cities will only continue to have to solve. The three main bike share and electric scooters companies -- Bird, LimeBike and Spin -- all have several million dollars in venture capital money. Bird is planning to expand into 50 new cities and announced another multi-million funding round. No one has it 100 percent figured out yet. ""There’s a lot of things like this coming, and we need to figure out how we’re going to regulate them,"" Suisson said.",https://www.cpr.org/show-segment/limebike-e-scooters-land-in-denver-after-begging-for-forgiveness-in-other-cities/
Electric Scooter Sharing Has Arrived In Denver But the City is Concerned,303 Magazine,,"Denver, CO",2018,6,1,"Electric Scooter Sharing Has Arrived In Denver But the City is Concerned. Denver Public Works has released a statement saying it will remove any unattended or illegally parked scooters. The city stated that LimeBike and Bird are in violation of Denver Revised Municipal Code Chapter 49, Article IX, which states it is unlawful to utilize any street, alley, sidewalk, parkway or other public places for the storage of goods, wares or merchandise. That means that via city rules and ordinances, “these scooters are not allowed to operate in the roadway except to cross the street at an intersection, nor are they allowed in bike lanes, on the city’s trail system, or in city parks.” Lime has also made a correction to their below quote to explain they want to help Denver reach its Denver Mode Shift Goal not its Vision Zero Goal. ] Denver now has a new mode of transportation. Last Friday, Lime (formerly LimeBikes) introduced Denver to shared electric scooters called Lime-S. Similar to its bike sharing program, Lime’s electric scooter users are able to look for a scooter near them using the Lime app and ride it wherever they need to go. Electric scooters have been rolled out in San Diego, Washington D.C., Miami, San Jose, Charlotte and now Denver. “We see Lime-S as an integral component in helping Denver achieve its Denver Vision Zero goal of 30 percent non-vehicle travel by 2030,” said Lime Spokeswoman, Mary Caroline Pruitt. “So far, Denver has only reached 13 percent non-vehicle travel, and by taking cars off the roads and replacing them with scooters, we believe we can alleviate traffic congestion, help Denver reach its Denver Mode Shift Goal, improve urban mobility, and transform the way people get around the city.” According to City Lab, Denver has the eighth-largest rail system in the country, but only 34 percent of people within the city of Denver live within walking distance from stops where the bus comes every 15 minutes or less. With Lime, 40 percent of their transportation services (i.e. bikes and scooters) start or stop at public transit stations. This means that people are using Lime as a way to either get to a public transit station or get home from a public transit station. Even though the hopes for the new scooters are pinned on improving alternative transportation methods, some of Denver’s public departments have mixed feelings on the launch. Denver Public Works (DPW) will be monitoring the scooters in the coming weeks and plan on releasing an official statement addressing questions and concerns. When Lime-S launched the scooter program, DPW sent out a tweet, expressing their own concerns. “We were not notified of LimeBike’s plans to deploy in our community last Friday until a couple of days beforehand,” Nancy Kuhn with Denver Public Works explained. “While Denver Public Works is supportive of new alternative transportation options, we feel these technologies should be deployed in a way that works with the city’s goals of increasing pedestrian safety and mobility. Specifically, we are concerned about the use, placement, and quantity of these scooters operating on Denver’s sidewalks, particularly in areas of high pedestrian activity. In addition, city ordinance prohibits anything from encumbering the public right of way without a permit and our Department will be removing scooters that are blocking sidewalks and other public spaces.” Backlash to these dockless systems isn’t new. Everywhere from Washington to Dallas and even China, has experienced some level of pushback to these systems due to their ill-conceived placements. Nonetheless, these systems continue to rise in popularity and growth — as seen here with the expansion to scooters. If you want to use Lime-S, you must be 18 years or older and have a valid drivers license. Lime’s website tells users to follow local traffic laws and local helmet regulations. The scooter has a maximum range of 37 miles and a maximum speed of 14.8 m.p.h. To use the scooter, users will have to download the Lime app in order to unlock the scooter, as well as lock it and end their ride when they are finished. It costs one dollar to unlock it and 15 cents per minute of riding.",https://303magazine.com/2018/06/electric-scooter-denver-lime/
Electric-scooter sharing company Bird lands in Denver but city puts up stop sign ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,6,1,"Electric-scooter sharing company Bird lands in Denver but city puts up stop sign. Bird deployed its first fleet of scooters in Los Angeles in September 2017. The electric-scooter infiltration of Denver continued as Bird, an electric vehicle sharing company, launched its fleet of electric-scooters Friday. And the city isn’t happy about it. Bird joins Lime, the well-known Aurora bikeshare program, as the second electric-scooter provider in Denver. Lime let its fleet of scooters loose in Denver on May 25. Bird’s scooters are now available in Downtown Denver, Curtis Park, Five Points, LoDo, and Villa Park. They have plans to expand to all of Denver as ridership grows, but that prospect faces a big hurdle. Denver Public Works on Friday gave notice to Bird and LimeBike that they are in violation of the city’s municipal code and ordered the companies to remove their scooters from the public right of way. In a news release, the city said it would remove unattended scooters found in rights of way. Further, the city stated that scooters aren’t allowed to operate on roadways except to cross the street at an intersection, in bike lanes, on the city’s trail system or in city parks. Denver will work toward developing regulations for dockless transportation companies, the city’s release said. Bird deployed its first fleet of scooters in Los Angeles in September 2017 and has since moved into San Francisco, Washington D.C, Nashville, Miami, Austin, and Charlotte, N.C. Company spokesman Kenneth Baer said the Mile High City was a next logical step. “Denver has 300 plus days of sunshine, and is also a growing and thriving city that is grappling with congestion, traffic, and trying to get people out of cars, and Bird offers a solution,” Baer said. Like Lime, Bird riders use the mobile app to find scooters and pay for rides. Bird scooters cost $1 to unlock and 15 cents per minute. Riders can zip around the city on the sleek black and white electric-scooters at speeds of up to 15 mph for about 15 miles per charge. Riders can also request helmets through the app. Bird was founded by Travis VanderZanden, a former Uber executive and first COO of Lyft, and has so far logged 1 million rides.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/01/denver-electric-scooters-bird-lime/
Why Have Electric Scooters Infiltrated Denver—And Are They Here to Stay?,5280,,"Denver, CO",2018,6,1,"Why Have Electric Scooters Infiltrated Denver—And Are They Here to Stay? Two companies dropped hundreds of dockless, electric scooters in Denver recently. But city officials are not impressed, and if the companies don't comply with regulations, the scooters may be gone for good. Last week, electric scooters invaded Denver. Suddenly, in an already bustling downtown, the scooters were everywhere: Weaving through traffic, buzzing around Coors Field, passing pedestrians on sidewalks, and sitting idly in public spaces. The proliferation of scooters—brought to the city by two separate companies, LimeBike and Bird— left some Denver residents thrilled and others a bit puzzled. The scooters didn’t just bewilder Denver residents—city officials were also caught off guard. On Friday, Denver Public Works (DPW) ordered the immediate removal of these scooters from the public right of way in Denver, says Nancy Kuhn, director of the department’s public information office. According to a statement released Friday by DPW, both companies have been notified that they are in violation of Denver Revised Municipal Code Chapter 49, Article IX, which prohibits utilizing any street, alley, sidewalk, parkway, or other public place for the storage of goods, wares, or merchandise. One of the reasons the scooters violate city code is because they are “dockless,” meaning a scooter can be left anywhere throughout the city. Anyone who downloads the respective Bird or LimeBike App can then find it, ride it, and leave it in a new location. It costs only $1 to activate a scooter, plus an additional 15 cents per minute thereafter. But because of this system, many of the scooters have been left on city sidewalks and trail systems, which DPW prohibits. Per company policy, Bird retrieves all of its scooters each night and redistributes them the next morning on private property—businesses or personal residences that have given permission for scooters to be docked. Additionally, Bird riders are instructed to leave the scooters near existing bike racks or in places that do not block public rights of way. LimeBike also collects its scooters and charges them every night and redistributes them in “approved” areas, says Mary Caroline Pruitt, the company’s communications manager. She also says LimeBike tries to ensure that the scooters are “parked responsibly” so that they are not blocking pedestrian right-of-way or obstructing any sidewalks or roadways. LimeBike is also working with local businesses so that the company can park scooters on private property. According to the DPW statement, scooters are not allowed to operate in roadways (except to cross an intersection), nor are they allowed in bike lanes, city trail systems, or in city parks, per city rules and ordinances. Therefore, the scooters are only permitted to be ridden on Denver’s sidewalks “in a controlled fashion,” yielding to pedestrians. However, Bird’s website says users should ride their scooters “in bike lanes when available” and instructs users: “Do not ride on sidewalks.” The regulations outlined by DPW seemingly give the electric scooter companies very narrow latitude with which to operate, and as such “the city will be removing scooters left unattended in the public right of way to the extent that its resources allow,” the statement says. However, as of Monday morning, unattended scooters could still be found throughout the city. Two Bird scooters were docked outside of the 5280 office on the Wazee Street sidewalk Monday morning and several scooters were still parked along the Cherry Creek Trail on Sunday night. The dockless scooters first arrived in Denver on May 25, when LimeBike brought its fleet to the city with a goal to help reduce the number of cars on city streets. Kuhn says DPW learned the afternoon of Wednesday, May 23, that LimeBike was going to be dropping 450 scooters in Denver on May 25. Bird then launched its scooter service on Friday, June 1, and according to Kuhn, the city “never received any notice.” Later that day DPW released its statement expressing concern and making clear city ordinances were being violated. Denver is not the only city dealing with this issue. Similar scooter services are available in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Washington D.C., and many California cities, and they pose similar concerns. On May 24, San Francisco took measures in response to “disruptive” scooter services, requiring companies to vacate the city until they’d gained a proper permit. It remains unclear what the future of dockless scooters in Denver will look like. As of Monday, June 4, Bird is still operating in Denver and hopes to work with the city regarding how that service will evolve. Likewise, Pruitt says the company reached out to DPW upon the notification of confiscation of their scooters to “better understand the reasoning behind taking them off the streets and whether there were other ways for the city and our team to effectively and efficiently partner on next steps.” Pruitt also noted that LimeBike wants to collaborate with the city on a regulatory framework that “enables the company to best serve Denver residents and visitors, while also working to overcome the initial community learning curves of a new form of transportation.” Kuhn says that the city removed five to seven scooters last week and picked up a similar number today. As for penalties for leaving the scooters in public places, “the owner(s) of the scooter(s) may be fined, according to city ordinance,” she says. As for creating a new regulatory framework, Kuhn says the city is “not yet” working with Bird or LimeBike, but is “discussing the next steps.”",https://www.5280.com/2018/06/why-have-electric-scooters-infiltrated-denver-and-are-they-here-to-stay/
Free-wheeling scooter companies Bird and Lime aren’t rushing to comply with Denver’s removal order. But they’re eager to get legal. ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,6,6,"Free-wheeling scooter companies Bird and Lime aren’t rushing to comply with Denver’s removal order. But they’re eager to get legal. Public works official says regulations could take a while, but emergency rules might be proposed sooner. Two companies this week still were ignoring Denver’s order to remove their dockless electric scooters from public streets and sidewalks, four days after the city spoke up. Instead, as Lime and Bird still displayed dozens and dozens of available scooters on their mobile apps Tuesday afternoon, they said only that they looked forward to working with the city’s Department of Public Works on rules that could legalize the zippy transports. That probably will take “at least several weeks,” DPW spokeswoman Nancy Kuhn said, and possibly longer, given the complexity of regulating a new industry. “We want to ensure any rules we enact are broad enough to cover both anticipated and unanticipated new mobility options,” Kuhn said. “I think we are probably looking at later this summer” for permanent regulations or an ordinance change. One possibility is to create emergency regulations that would apply for up to six months. Judging by scooter companies’ purposely disruptive playbook as they’ve rolled out dockless scooters in other cities, their experience in Denver — including the apparent disregard of a city removal order — is more or less going according to plan, by forcing the city’s hand while at the same time attracting users. A statement from Lime’s spokeswoman said the company wanted to help Denver overcome “the initial community learning curves of a new form of transportation.” It cited user data showing that in the first six days after its May 25 launch in Denver, more than 7,000 people rented scooters, taking upward of 16,000 trips and traversing 22,000 miles across the city. “We reached out to DPW upon the notification of confiscation of our scooters to better understand the reasoning behind taking them off the streets and whether there were other ways for the city and our team to effectively and efficiently partner on next steps,” Lime’s Mary Caroline Pruitt wrote in an email. So far, users have been delighted by the scooters, which cost $1 to unlock and then 15 cents a minute for a ride. The scooters go as fast as 15 mph. But they’ve also prompted plenty of grumbles — some scooters have been left blocking sidewalks or garages in alleys — and even aggression. One Denver Post reader reported that he spotted at least five scooters inside a dumpster off the 16th Street Mall last week. Denver Public Works said late Friday that its removal order was “immediate,” and it could issue citations and fines if officials decide to crack down on the companies. So far, Kuhn said, DPW workers have been seizing scooters on a case-by-case basis when they see them unattended in public areas. With big investor backing, the tech companies began breaking into cities in California earlier this year — often sparking resistance, since city ordinances typically weren’t written with the intent of allowing shareable devices that can be left pretty much anywhere. That’s the case in Denver, which doesn’t allow the storage of goods or privately owned equipment on public streets, alleys, sidewalks, parkways and other public places. But some urban advocates have argued that dockless scooters and bike-share systems offer opportunities to bridge transportation gaps and connect to transit, if only cities embrace them and make room for them. Austin, Texas, last month unveiled an extensive list of emergency rules, prompting mixed reaction from the companies. Los Angeles is working out a test program, as is San Francisco. The latter’s pilot-permit program will allow up to 1,250 scooters in the first six months. Planned requirements for the companies include keeping scooters from blocking sidewalks, providing insurance and protecting renters’ information. Before they could apply, three companies operating in that city since March had to pull all their scooters from public property — and they did so by Monday’s deadline, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Denver officials were on notice in recent weeks that the company behind LimeBike — which has a popular dockless bike-share program in Aurora — was interested in unleashing its scooters in Denver. But the company still caught city officials off guard when it launched in late May. Bird followed suit Friday, rolling out a fleet that looks to be even larger. Later that day, DPW put its departmental foot down — or tried to, at least. Neither Lime nor Bird this week would directly address whether it planned to remove its scooters. “We have received the Department of Public Works’ notice and look forward to working with the city of Denver so that Bird can continue to provide our convenient, affordable transportation solution that gets cars off of the road and reduces carbon emissions,” said Bird spokesman Kenneth Baer. Denver city officials in coming weeks and months will sort out whether and how the companies can operate legally, but they’ll also consider questions about where users can ride the scooters. As DPW’s statement pointed out last week, city rules bar the electric scooters from being used on streets (except to cross at intersections), in bike lanes, on city trails and in parks — all common places where riders have been seen zipping by in recent weeks.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/06/electric-scooter-rental-denver/

For starters, companies will have to apply for a permit and pay a $20,000 annual operator fee, plus a $130 annual charge per device.

Denver Public Works will limit the one-year pilot to five providers each under the e-scooter and bike categories. And each provider will be capped at 250 scooters or 400 bikes — with 100 more allowed if they’re targeted to “opportunity areas,” such as low-income neighborhoods. “Starting today, prospective applicants can apply for a permit,” DPW spokeswoman Nancy Kuhn said. “Denver Public Works will require some turnaround time to review permit applications, but will be working to get back to the companies that apply within a short time frame.” The rules for the program will allow scooter users — who pay $1, plus 15 cents per minute — to take them wherever they want, although trips ending at a bus or transit stop will be encouraged. Users will be asked to ride on sidewalks and park the scooters so they don’t block sidewalks or pedestrian sight lines at intersections. But the onus will be on the companies to “rebalance” the scooters back to transit stops periodically, with a full location reset required each morning. Lime was first to launch its scooter program in Denver on May 25, following on the heels of dockless scooter rollouts in several other U.S. cities. But as happened in many of those places, Denver city officials cracked down, pointing out that leaving privately owned devices in the public right-of-way violated local ordinance. It ordered the scooters removed, then began seizing hundreds of them and issuing $150-per-scooter fines. Last week, both companies agreed to remove their scooters after the city gave notice that it was working on an expedited permit program. No word yet from Lime on the program’s particulars, but a Bird spokesperson said: “We look forward to working with the city of Denver so that Bird can continue to provide our convenient, affordable transportation solution that gets cars off of the road and reduces carbon emissions.” Kuhn said DPW officials decided to use its existing “Transit Amenity Program” as the vehicle for the pilot, which sped up the process. This also signals that officials intend for the dockless transport pilot to test out ways to connect more people to public transportation. Here are some of the basics: To apply, each company must pay a $150 fee and then, if the one-year permit is granted, a $15,000 permit fee. It also will have to pay $20 per bike and $30 per scooter toward a city property repair and maintenance fund. The program overview sets out rules about where scooters can be placed by the companies, but they will be asked to paint parking zones on the pavement near some bus and transit stops. But operators will have to seek approval from the Regional Transportation District to park bikes and scooters at light rail and commuter rail stations. Scooter users are not supposed to ride electric scooters on streets, bike lanes and trails or in parks, since local and state laws consider e-scooters to be “toy vehicles.” Use also isn’t allowed along the 16th Street Mall.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/29/denver-scooter-bird-lime-legal/
Uber partners with one of the electronic scooter companies that infiltrated downtown last month ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,7,9,"Uber partners with one of the electronic scooter companies that infiltrated downtown last month. Lime first brought dockless bikes to Aurora in fall 2017, but faced legal battles with the city. Electric scooter rental company Lime is teaming up with Uber to bring an unconventional mode of transportation to the world. Uber Technologies Inc. is investing in Lime as part of a $335 million financing round, the companies plan to announce on Monday. The deal, led by Alphabet Inc.’s venture arm GV, values the scooter business at $1.1 billion. While details of the partnership are still being finalized, Uber plans to promote Lime in its mobile application and slap its logo on the scooters, executives from the two companies said. Uber took a similar step with a startup called Jump Bikes, which rents electric bicycles, before acquiring the business for more than $100 million in April. Uber said it still plans to roll out e-bikes in more cities around the world. The Uber-Lime alliance has implications for the brewing scooter ground war. Since Lime was founded 18 months ago, the San Mateo, California-based company has raised $467 million. Los Angeles-based Bird Rides has nearly as much cash. It was founded by Travis VanderZanden, a onetime Uber executive who has adopted a similar aesthetic to his former employer: In contrast to Lime’s bright color scheme and affable executives, Bird uses darker tones, and its founder is a controversial figure. Investors recently valued VanderZanden’s year-old company at $2 billion. Lime first launched a dockless bike-share program in Aurora in October 2017, before bringing dockless scooters to Denver in May this year. The company clashed with the city of Denver, which threatened to remove scooters if Lime didn’t clear them from obstructing public sidewalks and streets. Eventually the city followed through on this threat, confiscating 250 Lime and Bird scooters. It later launched a pilot program to guide the use of dockless scooters in Denver and Lime announced it would temporarily remove its scooters from Denver’s streets while it worked to get legal. Lime said its service, which lets customers rent scooters scattered around cities and leave them on the sidewalk for the next person to pick up, is available in more than 70 markets in the U.S. and Europe. The new cash will go toward buying tens of thousands of lightweight electric scooters. The scooters are manufactured in China to the company’s design specifications. Brad Bao, a former Tencent Holdings executive who co-founded Lime, is proud of the company’s investment in custom vehicles, as opposed to buying ones off the shelf. However, there’s a looming threat of a price hike as the U.S. targets scooters on a list of potential China tariffs. Lime said it doesn’t expect the trade war to impact its business. “We choose the harder path,” said Bao. “We’re a capital-heavy business.” Lime’s partnership with Uber raises as many questions as it answers about the ride-hailing company’s scooter strategy. Uber has filed an application in San Francisco to introduce a scooter service of its own. There’s also the risk of cheaper forms of transportation eating into Uber’s main business of car fares. “As a company we’ve leaned into self-cannibalization throughout our history,” said Rachel Holt, the former head of Uber’s North America ride-hailing business who’s now leading scooter and bike-rental efforts along with public transportation partnerships. She said Uber undercut its original ride-hailing business with a cheaper carpooling service. “We are going to continue to double down on the Jump acquisition that we’ve made, and we’ve got a very expansive roll-out strategy there that we’re excited about,” she said. Since taking over as Uber chief executive officer last year, Dara Khosrowshahi has articulated a strategy that would make the company’s app a central place for all kinds of urban transportation. This includes public transit, rental cars, scooters and bicycles. Uber was drawn to Lime because it’s already available in major cities. “We feel like their footprint is obviously quite expansive at this point, and we’re really excited to see where it can go,” Holt said. However, the deal doesn’t preclude Uber from entering the scooter business on its own, she said. Lyft Inc., which has gained popularity in the U.S. over the last year as Uber has stumbled, is also poised to get into the scooter and bike-rental businesses. It said last week it’s buying Motivate, the operator of Citi Bike in New York and similar services in other cities. But Lime said it was most impressed by Uber’s strategy and its global heft. “Not many ride-share programs are global,” said Chief Executive Officer Toby Sun. Lime is developing “Uber-type market share and Lyft-type reputation,” Sun said. “In this kind of market, they go together.” While the pact with Uber is set to have a more visible and immediate impact on Lime’s business, Google’s parent company is making the largest financial commitment to the scooter startup. Alphabet is investing both directly and through its GV fund. Alphabet is also an Uber investor, but the two have a tortured history. Alphabet’s Waymo has sparred with Uber in the courtroom and on the road, where people can hail rides from the search giant’s self-driving minivans in Arizona. GV partner Joe Kraus is joining Lime’s board, and he’s very excited about scooters. He said: “This reminds me a tremendous amount of the early days of the internet.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/07/09/uber-scooters-rent-lime-partnership/
Denver’s dockless scooter pilot program prompts permit applications from 7 companies ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,7,10,"Denver’s dockless scooter pilot program prompts permit applications from 7 companies. Four companies have submitted permits for dockless bikes. Soon there may be more than just the green and black scooters of Lime and Bird buzzing around Denver’s streets. Since Denver Public Works launched its pilot program for “dockless mobility technology” last month, seven companies have applied for permits that would allow them to unleash their scooters in the city. Those companies include Lime and Bird, as well as ride-sharing giant Lyft, and a few other familiar names: Spin, Razor, Skoot and Jump. Lyft also submitted a permit application for bikes, alongside Jump, Zagster and Ofo. The company may also begin competing with Uber in the areas of bike and scooter-sharing, after Uber announced it was partnering with Lime. Denver Public Works will grant permits to a maximum of five scooter-sharing companies and five bike-sharing companies. Each business will be allowed to release 250 scooters or 400 bikes in the city. They can add 100 additional bikes or scooters to their fleets if they are released in “opportunity areas” including low-income neighborhoods. The city’s pilot program was announced after the city clashed with Lime and Bird for obstructing public sidewalks and streets and began removing scooters.

"Despite Ban In Denver (And Elsewhere), Bird Scooter Sharing Company Grows",CBS Denver,CBS,"Denver, CO",2018,7,10,"Despite Ban In Denver (And Elsewhere), Bird Scooter Sharing Company Grows. Scooter rental startup Bird Rides is now valued at $2 billion after a recent $300 million funding round, according to a source close to the matter. That’s a fast rise for the Los Angeles-based company, which launched its first scooter pilot program in Santa Monica, California, last September. It now operates scooter shares in 22 US cities. “The investors love the growth … and the numbers, but I think they also like the mission of Bird,” said CEO and founder Travis Vanderzanden told CNNMoney. “People have been trying to find ways to get Americans out of cars for a long time, and we think Bird can have a big impact.” The scooters, which can go up to 15 miles per hour, give city residents an alternative commuting option. The scooters, rented via an app, cost $1 to unlock and about $0.15 to ride per minute. They operate on the same lithium ion batteries that cell phones and tablets use. “What we learned over time is that people are not only having fun on Birds and using them to explore cities, but they’re actually using them to commute to and from work,” said Vanderzanden, who was once the COO of Lyft and later a VP of growth at Uber. But not everyone is onboard with the electric scooter craze. Scooter startups like Bird allow riders to park them anywhere that doesn’t block pedestrian walkways. However, residents in cities such as Los Angeles say they often litter sidewalks and pose a danger to pedestrians. On Instagram, #ScootersBehavingBadly showcases photos of electric scooters blocking traffic and parked on top of city benches. Some cities like San Francisco and Denver have even banned them until new regulation is passed. Vanderzanden said he believes the scooters should be regulated, too. “We want to work with cities and figure it out,” said Bird’s Vanderzanden. “It’s been hard for [cities] to see this wave of electric scooters coming and so there’s really not a lot of laws around the electric scooters yet. We’re actually supportive of regulation.” Although Bird was among the first scooter share companies to market, it faces increasing competition from companies such as San Francisco-based Lime, which operates scooter and bikeshare programs in 70 cities. On Monday, Uber announced it is partnering with Lime to offer scooter rentals within its app. Meanwhile, Lime put hundreds of the scooters on the streets of Paris last month. “The numbers have been crazy [in] the first few days,” said Arthur-Louis Jacques, the head of Lime in France. “We put a few hundred scooters, and it’s not enough. We need to [add] more because people are looking for them.” Lime said one million people in the US already use its bike and electric scooter sharing services. The company raised $135 million dollars from investors since its launch a year and a half ago, according to Jacques. He declined to share Lime’s valuation. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo approved Lime’s scooter operation in the city, as long as riders stay on the road or city bike lanes. “For the moment, the scooters that I see are properly parked,” she said. “I have yet to see any scooters on the sidewalks.” She emphasized how this proper use is key to making the scooter system work in Paris. “If there were any [on sidewalks], they would be sanctioned,” she said. “You don’t have the right to ride on the sidewalks and to block the movement of pedestrians.”",https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/07/10/ban-denver-scooter-sharing-company-grows/
Denver issues permits to five dockless electric scooter companies and three dockless bike companies,Denverite,NPR,"Denver, CO",2018,7,25,"Denver issues permits to five dockless electric scooter companies and three dockless bike companies. The scooters are expected to be back on the streets starting this week. Lime, Bird and three other dockless electric scooter companies have been issued permits to operate within the city of Denver. The scooters are expected to be back on the streets starting this Friday, nearly two months after the city ordered them gone and began confiscating and issuing fines. The other companies to receive permits — which are one-year, revocable permits as part of a pilot program — are Lyft, Spin and Razor. Three dockless bike companies have received permits, too. Here’s the full list, per Denver Public Works, including fleet size and expected deployment dates: Other applications in the bike category are still under review. Denver Public Works has also shared these rules for parking dockless vehicles: Do not block the movements of pedestrians and always provide 5 feet clear width. Park adjacent to transit stops when available and at least 1.5 feet from the back of curb/flowline. Preserve pedestrian sight triangles at intersections, alleys, and driveways as well as to bus/LRT operations at stops. Vehicles should be upright when parked. Vehicles shall not impede access to utilities, or access from the street to the sidewalk. At least 8 feet of clear walkway shall be provided for all sidewalks on arterial streets. Additional clear width may be required in high pedestrian areas, as determined by DPW. Park in painted dockless parking areas, when available. Just yesterday, the Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure committee heard a presentation from Public Works on the Dockless Mobility Vehicles Pilot Program, and there are still some big concerns about how the scooters and bikes will operate safely and achieve the city’s mobility goals.

"Electric Scooters (Nearly 2,000 This Time!) Are Coming Back to Denver",5280,,"Denver, CO",2018,7,31,"Electric Scooters (Nearly 2,000 This Time!) Are Coming Back to Denver. Denver officials forced electric scooter companies to cease operations in the city two months ago. Now, the scooters are back and operating under new rules. Here's what you need to know. You thought things were crazy when a few hundred scooters infiltrated Denver back in May? Get ready for a heck of a lot more. Nearly 2,000 of the two-wheeled rides will be landing in Denver over the next two months. Last week, city officials cleared the way for five electric scooter and two electric bike companies to begin operating in the Mile High City. The first are already popping up. When electric scooters first arrived in Denver—seemingly out of nowhere—nearly two months ago, city officials were not impressed. Two companies, LimeBike and Bird, gave the city little (if any) notice in May before dropping off hundreds of scooters, which left Denver Public Works (DPW) scrambling to adjust. At the time, few regulations existed to accommodate the new mode of transportation, which meant Denverites were scooting pretty much wherever they pleased—weaving through traffic, cruising in bike lanes, and dodging pedestrians on the sidewalks. Equally as troubling, according to the city, was that people were leaving the scooters in random places, and in some cases they blocked public rights of way. After only a few days of chaos, DPW began confiscating scooters and ultimately, in early June, ordered both LimeBike and Bird to suspend their scooter operations until regulations could be agreed upon between the city and the companies. It took most of the summer, but as of last week the electric scooters have been cleared to relaunch in Denver as part of the city’s Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program. On Wednesday, July 25, DPW approved permits for Bird, Lime, and three other docklesss scooter companies to operate in the city with 350 scooters each. Lime and Bird scooters are already back on the streets, and over the next 60 days, as many as 1,750 electric scooters could infiltrate Denver, in addition to 1,000 electric bicycles by early 2019. But this time there are rules. According to a DPW statement, current City and County of Denver ordinances (as well as state law) classify e-scooters as “toy vehicles,” and therefore they are required to be ridden on the sidewalks. It’s currently illegal to ride electric scooters in roadways or in bike lanes, though the city is reviewing the ordinance language to determine whether the regulations should be changed. Per the DPW statement, “riders are urged to watch speeds and yield to pedestrians at all times,” though a DPW spokesperson confirmed that at this point there is no defined speed limit for scooters operating on sidewalks, but it is something the department will consider. (A Lime spokesperson said a scooter’s max speed is approximately 15 mph.) In order to ensure that the scooters are not strewn about the city and inhibiting the public right of way, DPW worked with Regional Transportation District (RTD) to develop guidelines for users. The guidelines mandate that the scooters be parked in an upright position adjacent to existing bike racks at RTD bus stops in a way that does not impede pedestrian flow. Painted parking areas may even be added to some RTD stops in the near future. If riders do not return the scooters to bus stops, the operating companies (Bird, LimeBike, etc.) are required to collect and return them to these locations every day. However, as of Tuesday morning, three electric scooters (two Bird, one Lime) were parked on the Wazee Street sidewalk outside of 5280‘s office, something that DPW public information specialist Heather Burke confirmed is not allowed. Burke says that the permits issued to these companies by DPW are revokable, and if users fail to adhere to the new requirements, the operating companies may lose their ability to continue service in Denver. Members of DPW’s right-of-way enforcement team are monitoring scooter activity in the city and reporting back to the companies as to whether users are riding and parking responsibly. But the city of Denver is not responsible for rider education, Burke says. Instead, the operating companies are tasked with informing riders how to stay compliant. Sam Sadle, who oversees government relations for Lime in Denver, says the company is taking various steps to educate potential riders. First, when users activate a scooter, an in-app alert will instruct them that in Denver they must ride on sidewalks and park the scooters at bus stations. Moreover, Sadle says, Lime is partnering with organizations like BikeDenver, Bicycle Colorado, Walk Denver, and Denver Regional Council of Governments to provide more information to prospective Lime users. Sadle says Lime also has a team of Denver-based employees who are on the streets advising riders. According to a company spokesperson, Bird scooters also provide an in-app tutorial on how to ride the scooter and how to park it. Moreover, Bird riders must upload a driver’s license to confirm they are 18 or older. Denverites will surely notice the return of Lime and Bird scooters this week, but here’s a look at the other companies that will soon bring similar services to Denver: Lime: Permit to deploy 350 scooters, launched July 27 Bird: Permit to deploy 350 scooters, launched July 30 Lyft: Permit to deploy 350 scooters, launching in September Spin: Permit to deploy 350 scooters, launching within 60 days Razor: Permit to deploy 350 scooters, launching within 30–45 days The city also granted Lyft—the popular ride-sharing company—and a business called Jump permits to deploy 500 electric bicycles each. Lyft is expected to deploy its e-bikes within the next six months, while Jump is launching with 250 bikes immediately and scaling up to 500 by early 2019. So, if you’re going to ride an electric scooter around Denver, here’s what you need to know: Download the respective app (Bird, LimeBike, etc.); it costs $1 to activate a scooter, plus an additional 15 cents per minute thereafter. Then follow the damn rules: Ride it on the sidewalk, park it at a bus station, and—most importantly—don’t hit any pedestrians.

Confusion Surrounds Controversial Electric Scooters In Denver,CBS Denver,CBS,"Denver, CO",2018,8,8,"Confusion Surrounds Controversial Electric Scooters In Denver. In May, electric scooters for rent through smartphone apps suddenly appeared on Denver streets. The city pulled them off and fined the companies nearly $40,000. Then in July, the city allowed them to return after the companies agreed to pay for permits and abide by a list of rules. CBS4 investigator Rick Sallinger found those rules are repeatedly being violated. Rule number one … No riding in bike lanes. So we wondered: Why are there so many scooters in those lanes? “Did you know you are not supposed to be in the bike lane?” One rider was asked. “Okay, I didn’t read that rule,” he replied. CBS4 found quite a few people weren’t aware of that rule. Another rider in a bike lane said he thought the bike lane is where he needed to be. “I think it (the app) says you are supposed to.” He’s right. The Lime app vaguely states, “Do not ride on sidewalks other than permitted by law. Use the bike lanes when available and permitted by law.” Bird has its app tailored to Denver’s specific rules. In fact, sidewalks are exactly where you are supposed to ride in Denver. Heather Burke, a spokesperson for the Denver Department of Public Works, says there is a steep learning curve and the scooter companies must inform the riders. “It’s a revocable permit, and it’s in the operator’s best interest to educate riders,” she said. She added they are already discussing possible changes to the existing laws regarding use of the scooters. Another rule says no riding on the streets, but it didn’t take long for us to find plenty of people violating that rule throughout the downtown area. The scooters are to be left at bus and other transit stops. But CBS4 found them just about everywhere. They were on street corners, sidewalks and wherever they happened to run out of their electric charge. Burke says there will soon be corrals at the stops for the scooters to be left. The city has been emphatic that there’s absolutely no scooter riding on the 16th Street Mall. How carefully is that obeyed? CBS4 found one rider after another with the rental scooters on the mall. In some cases the riders were slowing down mall buses and had to get out of the way. A group of riders on the mall was asked, “Did you know you’re not supposed to riding on the 16th Street Mall?” “Didn’t know that,” was the reply. A spokesperson from Bird issued this statement: Safety is our top priority and we are committed to partnering with the city of Denver to ensure that the community safely embraces our affordable, environmentally friendly transportation option. We strive to enhance the safety of Bird riders in Denver by taking concrete steps including: restricting the speed of our scooters to a 15 mph maximum, requiring riders to upload a driver’s license and confirm they are 18 or older, and providing an in-app tutorial on how to ride a Bird and how to park it. In addition, we were the first in the industry to offer free helmets to our riders. To date we have distributed nearly 40,000 free helmets to Bird riders.",https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/08/08/confusion-controversial-electric-scooters-denver/
Where Are Scooters Allowed In Denver? There Is Still A Lot Of Confusion,CBS Denver,CBS,"Denver, CO",2018,9,7," Where Are Scooters Allowed In Denver? There Is Still A Lot Of Confusion. Discussions are taking place on whether to seek a change in the law to allow electric rental scooters into the bicycle lanes in Denver. So far that’s not allowed, but CBS4 found riders are either ignoring the law or not clear on it. The rules are simple, no electric scooters allowed in Denver’s bicycle lanes. But the bike lanes are populated in some places by as many scooters as bikes. Some on cyclists are happy to put up with it, others aren’t quite as tolerant. Callum McCance rides his bicycle in the designated lanes and told CBS4’s Rick Sallinger, “The scooters are definitely somewhat of a nuisance if there were more consistent rules that would clear things up.” The problem is since the scooters are classified as “toys” they must ride on sidewalks. To allow them to legally ride in the bicycle lanes would require a change in Colorado law and Denver city ordinances. The legislative process could take many months. Bicycle Colorado, which lobbies for bike riders, is all in favor of allowing the scooters according to spokesman Jack Todd. “At 10 to 15 mph they are a hazard for pedestrians and really shouldn’t be on the sidewalk,” he said. He points out the scooters, like bikes, are better for the environment than cars. But for now, riding any electric scooter including the latest entry from Lyft is contrary to regulations. Lyft added its scooters to the streets of Denver this week bringing the total number of scooters to more than 1,000 with more to come. The scooters can be located, unlocked, and paid for on the Lyft app. Rideshare scooters and bikes are the newest additions to Lyft’s mission to improve people’s lives through improving transportation. Lyft’s app for Denver scooters does indicate you are not allowed to ride in bike lanes. But as CBS4 previously reported, instructions for other scooter companies are not as clear. Denver Public Works oversees the scooter program and notes a “learning curve” is involved since the permits and regulations are brand new. Denver Public Works spokesperson Heather Burke said other cities are now turning to Denver for guidance. So, what happens if you get caught by police riding a scooter in the bicycle lanes? According to Denver police, no enforcement is taking place at the present time unless there is an accident. Lyft is charging $1 to unlock a scooter and .15 cents for each minute the ride is open. The scooters will be available to ride from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. Riders must be 18-years-old with a valid driver’s license.",https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/09/07/electric-scooters-denver-lyft-lime/

This has been Denver's summer of the scooter, and the city's sidewalks are about to see hundreds more as its residents trade in their iced coffees for pumpkin spice lattes. Companies that make dockless electric scooters and bicycles have come a long way since June, when Denver Public Works was confiscating them from sidewalks. The city has since formed a Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program that allows as many as 10 firms (five for each mode of transportation) to be permitted to operate fleets of scooters and bikes, so long as they follow certain guidelines like providing unique identifiers for each vehicle, maintaining insurance and keeping them in designated parking areas so they don't clog the city's sidewalks.

Bird: Bird was right behind Lime — dropping its scooters on the Mile High City in late May. It's also maxed out at 350 scooters. Lyft: The ride-hailing service is getting into the scooter game, and has deployed 50 scooters. It plans on scaling up to 350 within the next week or two, according to the city. Spin: Newcomer Spin is already operating in Aurora and 18 other cities, according to its website. It has been licensed to operate 350 scooters in Denver within the next 30 days. Razor: This scooter and hoverboard retailer is getting into the rental space. It plans on deploying 350 scooters later this month, according to tentative plans provided by the city. Bikes Jump: This e-bike firm was acquired by Uber last year, and its signature red frame already has a major presence on Denver's streets. There are currently 250 Jump bikes in Denver, and the the company plans to max out at 500 in the first quarter of 2019.

"Scooter rider slapped by pedestrian as confusion reigns, injuries mount in Denver ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,10,1,"Scooter rider slapped by pedestrian as confusion reigns, injuries mount in Denver. Pedestrians, drivers confused over rules concerning where scooters are allowed. Eric Lazzari thought he was doing everything right. He needed to get across downtown Denver for a meeting, so he grabbed one of the electric scooters that have saturated the central city. He had closely followed the bureaucratic drama around the rollout of these dockless devices, so he knew all the rules. “I was up on the sidewalk,” Lazzari said. “Even though I hate being there, I know that’s where I’m supposed to be.” He was right — but this rule follower was about to feel the growing pains of this new mode of transportation. Literally. And he’s not the only one. Talking smack The 40-year-old nonprofit employee pulled the vehicle to a stop at an intersection. A large man with a big, fluffy white dog came striding up. “Those things are supposed to be on the street,” the man said. Lazzari tried to explain the subtleties of the law. City staff’s interpretation of state and local law says that the scooters are “toy vehicles” that are restricted to sidewalks. The guy didn’t care. He declared that it was a “motorized vehicle” and announced that he was “going to teach me a lesson,” Lazzari recalled. With that, the stranger delivered a swift smack to the back of Lazzari’s head, according to Lazzari. “My guess was he’s a downtown resident either ignorant of the law or sick of encountering them on the sidewalk, and decided to deal with it in a very inappropriate way.” Lazzari called police, he said, but a Denver Police Department official could not find an official report of the incident. Making adjustments City officials say they’re researching state and local laws, looking for a way to legalize the use of scooters in bike lanes. State law places toy vehicles alongside “skis, toboggans, coasting sleds (and) skates,” and bans them from the road. “In the meantime, we’re asking riders to watch their speed on the sidewalk and yield to pedestrians at all times,” wrote Nancy Kuhn, a spokeswoman for Denver Public Works. As of Sept. 24, the companies Lime, Bird and Lyft had deployed 750 scooters in Denver. By the end of October, that number could grow to 1,750 as Spin and Razor join the fray. The city also is home to 250 dockless electric bikes from Jump; that number could grow to 1,000 in 2019. As it grows, Denver is tinkering with the program — for example, riders will soon see painted parking zones near transit stops, and the city is trying to create a real-time data system to track all the vehicles. But that won’t solve one emerging problem. “I think it has all the setup to be a high rate of injuries,” said Dr. Nick Rosen, medical director of the emergency department at Porter Adventist Hospital. High impact There is no official count of scooter injuries, but people have been trickling into Denver’s emergency rooms with injuries such as broken wrists, lacerated faces and at least one concussion. “There’s been an uptick at Rose (Medical Center) in the injuries. I wouldn’t say it’s dramatic — probably one to three a week,” said Dr. Andrew Ziller, chair of emergency medicine at Rose. One member of Rosen’s group treated a man who broke his wrist by trying to speed around a group of pedestrians and hitting a stair. Rose and Porter are outside of downtown, so they likely see fewer injuries than downtown Denver Health. A Denver Health representative did not provide information about injuries. Nationwide, a Washington Post report described a “spike” in ER visits. Deaths and injuries from vehicles are already common. But what concerns Ziller and Rosen, they said in separate interviews, is the fact that few scooter riders wear protective gear. They see a system that could create preventable injuries. “I’ve never seen a person with a helmet riding it,” Rosen said. “They’re just out, they see them there, and that inspiration is in the moment.” That’s a worrying trend, Ziller said. “We don’t often see bad head injuries from bicyclists,” he explained, “because so many are wearing helmets.” Bird and Lime offer helmets to riders for free through their apps, and Lyft has free helmets at its “Lyft Hub” in Denver on Wednesdays and Fridays from 5 to 8 p.m. Colorado law does not require helmets for bicyclists, scooter riders or motorcyclists. Lazzari said he later tried to order a helmet from Bird, but found the process too cumbersome. If he had been wearing one, it might have spared him a stinging slap to the head.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/01/denver-dockless-scooters-confusion-injuries/
Are electric scooters worth the headache? ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,10,2,"Are electric scooters worth the headache? Getting slapped up-side the head by an angry pedestrian — as Eric Lazzari was while riding a scooter downtown Denver — isn’t the only way dockless electric scooters are causing headaches in Denver. They crowd the sidewalks where they are parked awaiting customers or clog the right-of-way where they get left by riders not following the rules. The motorized scooters move too fast for the sidewalk, but are banned from bike lanes and the roadway by law. Helmets aren’t readily available for riders, most of whom have no experience riding the machines when they insert a credit card and zip off either for fun or for serious transportation needs. Accordingly there has been an increase in scooter related injuries. So, are these devices that were dropped on our city with little notice by profit-making entities worth the headache? We certainly hope so. Because the little lime-green nuisances hold the potential to overcome some of Denver’s biggest transit woes — getting folks over that last-mile, first-mile hurdle that discourages them from getting out of their single-occupancy vehicle and using transit. Many things keep two-thirds of commuters in their cars alone while they drive to and from work in Denver — speed, convenience, the need to transport children or stop at a grocery store, the cost of transit, parking problems at rail or bus stations and a sense that riding bikes (or scooters) is unsafe in Denver. Not to mention the incompatibility of riding in dress clothes or adverse weather. Dockless electric bikes and scooters can alleviate some of those impediments. The city is working on it with a Ditch Your Car pilot program that offers riders pre-paid cards to access these unconventional modes of transportation. Dedicated parking spaces for the dockless devices are being painted at transit stops, and city officials were admirably quick in developing a Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program and using public works right-of-way enforces to keep abandoned devices from clogging our sidewalks. But much more needs to be done in the way of safety. Doctors at both Porter Adventist Hospital and Rose Medical Center report an uptick in injuries related to the devices, and all it takes is one inexperienced rider zipping through traffic, or a driver distracted by a cell phone for this experiment to turn fatal. All of this is to say, the city should proceed with caution. Yet, perhaps the greatest solution to all of these issues is creating more dedicated bike lanes, and a corresponding change in the law to allow motorized bikes and scooters to operate in those lanes. Commuters are more likely to get out of their cars if they feel safe, and cyclists or scooter riders are safest in dedicated lanes. If these soon-to-be-in-the thousands of motorized scooters and bikes turn out to be as popular as the companies investing in them think they will be, it’ll be one more reason to invest transit dollars on bike lanes instead of widening roads. In November Colorado voters have the opportunity to approve Proposition 110, a sales tax increase that would fund billions in state-wide transportation projects but also will direct money to the municipal level for roads, bridges, bike lanes, and transit. For Denver it could mean $846 million over the next 20 years, and that’s in addition to the $431 million voters approved in 2017 for the mobility portion of the Elevate Denver bonds. It’ll take money and ingenuity to dull Denver’s collective transportation migraine.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/02/are-electric-scooters-worth-the-headache/

Spin is the last competitor in Denver’s scooter showdown. Here’s why they still expect profits. ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,10,19,"Spin is the last competitor in Denver’s scooter showdown. Here’s why they still expect profits. The company plans to roll out 250 vehicles around LoDo and River North. The first act of Denver’s scooter saga is nearly over: Today, the last of five competing companies deployed its dockless fleet in Denver. “We’re coming in a little late, but we’re very confident in our service and our ability to work collaboratively with the city,” said Ben Bear, vice president of business for Spin. Spin is rolling out 250 vehicles around downtown, Lower Downtown and River North, and the company will add 100 more in a second wave. Healthy market? Spin’s entry comes four months after Bird and Lime surprised the city by deploying hundreds of scooters without getting city permission. Razor and Lyft followed as Denver established a pilot program to legalize the dockless programs. The city has authorized up to 1,750 scooters, divided evenly between the five companies — and Bear is confident that the market can support much more. Spin has found that its dockless scooters get used up to 15 times more often than its bicycles, Bear said. The individual units are profitable to operate, he added. “That gap (between costs and revenue) drives the excitement,” he said. Rides across the industry cost $1 upfront and $0.15 per mile. In Charlotte, North Carolina, riders took 100,273 scooter trips for a total of about 139,000 miles in a single month, according to city data. That would be about 125 rides for each of the city’s 800 authorized scooters. In Portland, Oregon, the scooters have averaged about 187,000 rides per month, or about 91 rides per authorized scooter, according to city data. Denver is working to collect similar data, but the system isn’t ready yet. Design to change In fact, Bear’s greatest concern is whether manufacturers can make enough scooters. “The supply chain is just not at a level yet where it can keep up with how fast the industry is moving,” he said. Bird, Lime and Spin use similar designs that were adapted from a consumer model and based on technology from the Segway scooters that were introduced in 2001. The Chinese company Segway-Ninebot is the largest manufacturer. In the near future, Bear expects the common design to evolve to include turn signals, a rear-facing light and potentially a lock to attach the vehicles to bike racks or poles. Future versions also could hide cabling inside of the vehicle frame. “It’s just an issue of the supply chain needing to move really fast and innovating at the same time,” he said. There’s also the question of bike lanes and sidewalks. Denver’s current rules say scooters have to ride on sidewalks. Spin plans to lobby for a change — part of its broader strategy to partner with governments and bike and pedestrian advocates, Bear said. “We have a partnership promise. We never launch without a permit. And we’re very focused on this being a reliable and lasting form of transportation,” he said. Spin’s rollout here will include a local warehouse overseen by a regional general manager. A staff of part-timers and contractors will charge and maintain the vehicles. It won’t rely as heavily on the “gamified” or Uber-style model, in which other companies use their apps to pay people to find and charge scooters each night. Denver’s pilot scooter program will run until next summer.",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/19/spin-scooters-denver-dockless/
Denver electric scooter provider recalled scooters in other markets amid fears some could catch on fire ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2018,10,30,"Denver electric scooter provider recalled scooters in other markets amid fears some could catch on fire. Lime said the recall impacted service in the Los Angeles, San Diego and Lake Tahoe markets. Lime, one of the nation’s largest electric scooter companies, pulled thousands of its scooters off the streets this summer after discovering that a small number of them may be carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire, according to company officials. The company said in a statement that it learned of a risk in August that a “manufacturing defect” in some of its scooters “could result in the battery smoldering, or in some cases, catching fire.” The statement came in response to questions from The Washington Post about Lime’s scooters catching on fire. Though company officials said in an interview Lime recalled about 2,000 scooters, they said the risk of smoldering and fires was only real in a tiny percentage of cases. The company said it took off the streets the much larger number out of an abundance of caution. “All vulnerable scooters were quickly removed from circulation, minimally impacting service to our Los Angeles, San Diego and Lake Tahoe markets,” the company said in the statement. “At no time were riders or members of the public put at risk.” There was no mention of any scooters in Denver being affected. After about three weeks on Denver’s streets, Lime’s scooters were temporarily removed from the city in June. That came after Denver Public Works said it was initiating a new pilot program for “dockless mobility technology” to keep the city’s streets and sidewalks clear but allow riders to take advantage of dockless forms of transportation. Earlier this month, a California attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against Bird, Lime, Xiaomi and Segway, saying motorized scooters were causing numerous serious injuries across the country. The company acknowledged it may face continuing challenges. It said it has received an unconfirmed report that another scooter model it uses “may also be vulnerable to battery failure.” And it said that, in an unrelated issue, it is exploring whether some of its scooters “can sometimes break when subjected to repeated abuse.” The company said it’s possible for these scooters “to crack or break if ridden off a curb at high speed.” Before Lime’s statement, some employees raised concerns internally about whether the company was doing enough to address safety risks with its scooters, according to a Lime mechanic, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the employee still works for the company. The mechanic provided images of internal Slack messages in which another employee also raises concerns. “I feel that these scoots, or the product as a whole, should be removed from the market until they are safe to handle and operate,” wrote the other employee in the “mechanics” slack room. “I get that the scoots are expendable and replaceable, but are we now resigned to say the same for the safety of employees and customers?” On one occasion, the Lake Tahoe Fire Department was summoned to the company’s Lake Tahoe facility in August after a scooter burst into flames, according to a department report. Like much of its competition, Lime has raced across the country in recent months, depositing their vehicles in dozens of cities. Scooter startups have become powerful forces at the local level, pushing city officials to rewrite regulations with promises of valuable data-sharing and less traffic. But the companies’ rapid growth has come at a price, according to critics. Emergency room physicians have reported an uptick in severe injuries — including head trauma and broken bones — since electric scooters appeared on streets around the country. Critics have raised concerns that some scooter companies have failed to properly maintain their vehicles, most of which were designed for personal, but not widespread public use. In response to criticism, the scooter industry has emphasized that safety is its top priority and that cars cause far more deaths and injuries than scooters. “Scooters are a new mode of transportation and Lime, together with the micro-mobility industry, remains committed to ensuring everyone knows how to ride safely,” Lime said in the statement. Lime said the battery issue concerned a brand of scooter manufactured by the mobility company Segway Ninebot. (Segway did not respond to requests for comment.) Lime said some of the welding surrounding the battery may have had weak spots, causing the batteries to short. External cases that hold Lime scooter batteries often sustain damage from vehicles hitting the ground and colliding with objects. While saying he’s unable to make a determination without examining the battery directly, Tim Ellis — a metallurgical engineer whose company, RSR Technologies, specializes in recycling batteries — said that damage could make a lithium ion battery more prone to catching on fire. “Anything you do that mechanically juggles, vibrates, bangs or runs into things will absolutely enhance the possibility of failure,” Ellis said. “The box the battery is in looks really heavy. That suggests it can handle a huge amount of damage, but at some level everything breaks.” Inside the company, some employees have been worrying about the safety of its products for months. In an interview, the Lime mechanic described sharing fears with managers that the people who Lime pays to recharge scooters in their homes overnight — so-called “juicers” — may not be aware of the risk of fire. The employee cited an internal Slack messages provided to The Washington Post in which a Lime manager instructs an employee to retrieve a “code red” scooter — shorthand for the scooters with the battery defect — from a juicer’s home in August. When the juicer refused to hand over the vehicle, the manager instructed the employee to “warn him that it’s urgent,” but did not mention the threat of fire. “These people are plugging these scooters into their house at night and going to sleep thinking they’re safe and that they just earned an easy $15,” the employee said. “When I asked my managers if we were going to tell them, all I got was shrugged shoulders and ‘I don’t know.’ ” Lime did not comment on the mechanic’s assertion, but said in its own statement that going forward Segway Ninebot scooters will be only be charged at Lime’s “scooter storage facilities” and “no longer available to Juicers for after hours charging.” The company said it is also staffing charging global charging facilities with 24 hours a day with employees trained to handle “these particular batteries.” The only known case where a Lime scooter caused a fire was at the company’s Lake Tahoe facility on Aug. 27. By the time the fire department arrived, a flaming electric scooter had been blasted with a fire extinguisher and placed in a back parking lot, according to the fire department’s incident report. The vehicle was still smoking, the battery periodically re-erupting in flames, the report states, its fumes filling the air with an acrid chemical stench. A night employee told investigators the fire began with “a loud bang,” prompting the employee to walk inside a “scooter repair room,” where he witnessed “flames showing from the battery area of a scooter as well as an adjacent chair,” according to the incident report. The fire prompted the fire department to tell the company to remove all scooters suspected of having faulty batteries to the parking lot “to ensure that there wouldn’t be another scooter fire inside the building.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/30/lime-recalled-scooters-amid-fire-fears/
It’s Time for Denver to Rethink Electric Scooters,5280,,"Denver, CO",2018,11,14,"It’s Time for Denver to Rethink Electric Scooters. It's been nearly six months since e-scooters first descended on Denver's sidewalks. If the dockless machines are going to stick around, a few things must change. When electric scooters suddenly infiltrated Denver’s streets this past summer, I was skeptical, but curious and eager to learn more. Working for 5280 offered me an opportunity to explore the new transportation method through reporting. Scooters became my beat. I wrote about scooters when Bird and Lime arrived essentially unannounced in May and subsequently got booted from the city. I wrote about scooters when they came back in July under stricter regulations, and when Lyft and Razor joined the party this fall. For the past six months, I’ve covered Denver’s transformation into a scooter city, while carefully withholding my prejudices. I wanted to see how the scooters would integrate into the city, and I even became cautiously optimistic that Denver’s pilot program would be effective. But as summer gave way to fall, scooters of every brand were left toppled on sidewalks. They were discarded on our bike trails. They were found snapped in half and abandoned. At least one was even tossed off a bridge into the Platte River. Because the 5280 office is in LoDo, the epicenter of scooter activity, I’ve probably had more exposure than the typical Denver resident. But from what I’ve seen, the hippest two-wheelers in town are looking less like an innovative solution to our transportation woes, and more like urban litter unworthy of the Mile High City. Sure, the scooters themselves are a nuisance, but the unrealistic and unenforcible rules set by the city have left the companies with an uphill climb. City guidelines mandate that the scooters be parked upright and adjacent to existing bike racks at RTD bus stops so they don’t impede pedestrian flow. But cruise around downtown, and you’ll find many scooters have been parked randomly on sidewalks, posing a risk to pedestrians and creating accessibility concerns for those in wheelchairs or pushing strollers. What’s more is that Denver ordinance classifies scooters as “toy vehicles” that must be ridden on the sidewalk and, unlike most other cities, are prohibited from operating in roadways or in bike lanes. So, local pedestrians must avoid riders cruising down city sidewalks at 15 miles-an-hour, something that “doesn’t really make sense for anybody,” says James Waddell, executive director of BikeDenver. “The fact that they can only be on the sidewalk is pretty limiting and quite dangerous.” The city is considering updating the “toy vehicle” ordinance (spring 2019 is the target date for proposed changes), but for now the scooters must remain on the sidewalk. When I was reporting this summer, I asked city officials about these issues, and was told “these things take time” and that with every new form of transportation there are “learning curves.” Fair enough. I waited to see if the scooters would become less disruptive. But as more arrived—Spin was the last company to launch here, bringing the total number to 1,750—the more I’ve become convinced Denver residents and visitors are unwilling to treat the new technology, and the city itself, with respect. I recently reached out to Lime and Bird—the two longest-operating e-scooter companies in Denver—about some of the challenges facing scooters in the city and sent along several photos of discarded scooters taken by 5280 staff. Bird did not respond to a request for comment. A Lime spokesperson wrote in an email that less than one percent of the company’s 35,000 scooters nationwide have been vandalized and that each scooter is “equipped with built-in sensors that can track when a scooter or bike has fallen down or if someone is trying to steal it.” The spokesperson wrote that Lime is testing a system in which users take a picture of the scooter at the end of each ride to ensure that it is parked correctly. Lime also recently announced that it is pledging $3 million to a campaign called “Respect the Ride,” which encourages more responsible riding, including addressing improperly parked scooters. When I approached the city this week for comment, a spokesperson wrote that Denver Public Works “continues to monitor behavior and is in close communication with the operators about any compliance issues.” The extent to which the city is holding the operators accountable is still unclear, but the Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program runs through next summer and the permits are revokable. The city spokesperson noted that it’s “too early to determine at this time if the [pilot program] will be extended” next July. Now, I understand there are many advocates who want rentable scooters to work in Denver and in cities across the country. And for good reason. The scooter companies claim they’re taking cars off the streets and reducing emissions. Earlier this summer, a Lime spokesperson told me that over a one-week period, 7,000 Denver residents and visitors made more than 16,000 trips on their scooters, covering 22,000 miles and saving 20,000 pounds of would-be CO2 emissions. If accurate, that’s an encouraging metric. But I can’t help but wonder to what extent that benefit is offset by scooters left abandoned around the city and then retrieved by company representatives via vehicles—an impact which is surely harder to measure. The cycling community (to which my daily commute to and from work makes me an active member) is largely receptive of the dockless scooters’ growth, as well. In July, BikeDenver and Bicycle Colorado issued a joint statement, arguing “these technologies can play a pivotal role in achieving the goals laid out in Denver’s Mobility Action Plan,” which aims to increase the number of people utilizing alternative transportation modes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The cycling community is an active and powerful coalition, both locally and nationally, and the fact that cyclists support e-scooters is worth our attention. For instance, when I spoke with Waddell, he told me he had just hopped off an electric scooter. “[Cyclists] generally believe scooters are a good thing,” he said. “It’s giving people a chance to move around the city in some way other than a vehicle, which is what we’re trying to change behavior around.” It also can’t hurt that scooter companies have pledged to help fund bike lanes in cities where they operate. Maybe the cycling community is embracing scooters because it recognizes a common ally in the ongoing discussion to expand infrastructure, but most of the cyclists I’ve spoken with seem patient and at least mildly supportive (if not downright enthusiastic) about the influx of scooters. Outside magazine even sent its “Bike Snob” to Portland to write a review of the e-scooters, which he called “laughably benign.” He concluded the piece by writing: “Really, if this is the future, what’s not to like?” No offense to the Bike Snob, who lives in New York City where there are not yet e-scooters, but there’s a big difference between visiting a scooter city and living in one. In September, an older gentleman stopped by the 5280 offices to express his concerns about the “electric scooters possessing our sidewalks.” This man lives at a downtown senior living facility, and said that he and his fellow residents are genuinely scared that they’ll be hit by one of the many scooters zooming outside of their front door. In fact, I’ve spoken with dozens of people who recall nearly being bowled down by distracted riders. As a pedestrian, the safety concerns are obvious. But I didn’t understand why the devices were being abandoned so haphazardly until I tried one myself. If operating without full charge, the tiny machines risk losing their scoot before you ever reach your destination—which was the case on the warm Sunday afternoon in late August when my roommate and I tried scooting from Coors Field to our house near Sloan’s Lake. We downloaded the apps for Lime and Bird, and set off looking for their respective scooters. Our search proved difficult. We kept arriving at pick-up locations only to find scooters swooped by other riders. When we did find unattended scooters and scanned their codes, they were often dead or broken. Finally, after 30 or so frustrating minutes, we found two scooters near REI and sped away—me on a black-and-white Bird and my roommate on a green Lime. We crossed I-25 on 23rd Avenue and rode up the steep hill—my scooter struggling a bit—and then crossed Federal. As my roommate cruised ahead on his sporty Lime, my fatigued Bird lost its charge. It flew no more. Still a ways from home, I tried kicking my scooter forward, but the Bird only chirped: “Hey, idiot, your scooter’s dead. Go no further. Big Brother’s watching” or words to that effect. Frustrated, I leaned the scooter against a random tree on the sidewalk and waited for my roommate to realize I was not in tow. He eventually circled back and I stepped on to the back of his scooter—a decision I will forever regret. For the record, my roommate is 6-foot-6, and when he’s standing on a scooter he naturally attracts attention. The addition of me saddling up behind him and clinging to his hips increased the onlookers tenfold (or at least it felt like it). I have since repaired my esteem but have not risked climbing on another scooter since that day. Even though I’ve sworn off electric scooters, I understand there are plenty of Denverites who think they’re downright groovy. In fact, when we polled our Instagram followers about the scooters a few months ago, 59 percent responded that they “Love ’em” while just 41 percent indicated they “Hate ’em.” Just because they’re not for me doesn’t mean scooters should be banned. But the city must address some of the inherent issues if the scooters are going to stick around for the long term. With the pilot program expiring next summer, Denver officials ought to do something to address the proliferation of discarded scooters—perhaps by more forcefully requiring the companies to hold individuals accountable and by creating permanent designated parking areas. The city should also consider reducing the number of rentable scooters. Unless Denverites prove that they can follow established regulations and better respect the city, having nearly 2,000 scooters available for rent is simply too many. Moreover, the scooters cannot remain on our sidewalks. The city needs to update its ordinance to allow scooters to operate in bike lanes and on bike paths throughout the city. While taking scooters off the sidewalks poses its own risk of injury, it is a better alternative than putting unknowing pedestrians in harm’s way. In a perfect world, Denver might have proven the new technology is the future of urban transportation. Unfortunately, residents and visitors are failing the social experiment—opting for the convenience, but neglecting the accompanying responsibility. It isn’t crazy to want to walk down the sidewalks without fear of injury, or to not want to look at broken toy vehicles strewn about town. I’m not calling for the eradication of scooters, but if Denver is going to be a scooter city, we need to go about it in a different (and more thoughtful) way.",https://www.5280.com/2018/11/its-time-for-denver-to-rethink-electric-scooters/
"Denver Public Works to propose new rules concerning electric scooters on roads, sidewalks",Denver7,ABC,"Denver, CO",2018,12,6,"Denver Public Works to propose new rules concerning electric scooters on roads, sidewalks. New rules may be coming down the pike for electric scooter riders. On Dec. 11, Denver Public Works will attend Denver City Council’s Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to discuss proposed changes to the current scooter rules that were originally crafted in partnership with District 5 Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman and District 6 Councilman Paul Kashmann. Currently, local and state law classifies electric scooters as toy vehicles and requires them to operate on sidewalks. Under the new proposal, dockless scooters would be reclassified as Electric Mobility Scooters (EMS). This new classification would come with the following rules: EMSs must operate in a bike lane if one is available If a bike lane is not available, EMSs can ride in the roadway as long as the road does not exceed 30 mph. They must stay to the right of the road If a bike lane is not available and the roadway has a speed limit faster than 30 mph, the EMS may operate on the sidewalk When riding on the sidewalk, EMS may not exceed a speed of 6 mph and must yield to all pedestrians EMSs must not exceed the speed limit of 15 mph at any time on the roadway The committee will discuss the proposed bill next week, before heading to a vote before the full council.",https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-public-works-to-propose-new-rules-concerning-electric-scooters-on-roads-sidewalks
"Scooters, get off the sidewalk: Denver approves first big dockless change ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,1,7,"Scooters, get off the sidewalk: Denver approves first big dockless change. The first big switch will be scooters in the bike lane. The Denver City Council on Monday unanimously approved revisions to the city’s regulations for dockless scooters, which many had dismissed as archaic and confusing. Previously, the zippy two-wheel vehicles were supposed to stay on sidewalks in Denver, even though they can hit 15 mph. The new law says that commuter scooters should travel in bike lanes and on low-speed roads when available. “It’s trying to recognize the scooter for what it is: a motorized vehicle,” said Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, who proposed the bill along with Councilman Paul Kashmann. “What this whole process has kind of shone a light on is how much work we have to do to provide safe passage for bicycles and scooters and anything other than private autos around the city,” Kashmann said at a meeting last month. “So, hopefully this disruptive technology will have a silver lining along the way.” This doesn’t apply to toy scooters. It’s only for single-rider, stand-up electric vehicles with top speeds up to 20 mph. Representatives for the companies Lyft, Lime and Bird praised the change. What’s next? This is the second recent city law about scooters. The city first legalized the general “dockless” concept after Bird and Lime deployed the scooters without authorization in Denver. Under the “pilot” program, five companies can deploy up to 350 scooters each. Riders unlock the vehicles with an app, then leave them on sidewalks and other public areas. Now, the city will keep looking at tweaks. Susman said the city needs a “mobility department,” an idea that Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration has discussed. Councilwoman at-large Robin Kniech asked how the scooter companies would improve the “culture of use” for the scooters, saying she’d heard concerns that misplaced scooters were blocking the paths of people with disabilities. “You have to be doing more on the rider education front,” she said. Councilman Rafael Espinoza has suggested creating new parking areas for scooters, especially in unused spaces near intersections. Councilman Albus Brooks has questioned whether scooter riders will be able to obey the new speed limits; the vehicles don’t usually come with a speedometer. And Councilman Chris Herndon said the city needs to prepare for the scooters to spread beyond downtown. “I do believe this is something that will eventually leave the (urban) core,” he said at an earlier meeting. State lawmakers also are planning to tackle scooter regulations this year, according to city staff. Meanwhile, Mayor Hancock has promised 125 miles of new bike lanes over five years, which could attract more scooter riders. Brooks said the city has “got to get serious” about that goal. He’s already warning residents that bike lanes could replace on-street parking.",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/07/denver-dockless-scooter-rule-changes/
"Denver’s dockless scooters have traveled nearly a million miles in first 6 months, report finds ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,2,13,"Denver’s dockless scooters have traveled nearly a million miles in first 6 months, report finds. Fleet sizes could increase 25 percent as rider demand increases. On an average day in Denver, people will tap their phones and unlock a scooter nearly 5,000 times. That’s according to the city’s first major report on its “dockless” program, which allows companies like Lyft and Uber to deploy rental scooters and bikes on the city’s sidewalks and streets. In all, the fleet of about 1,300 scooters has traveled nearly 1 million miles since Aug. 1, according to data the companies have provided to the city. The peak time to scoot is Sunday afternoon, but Monday afternoon is nearly as popular. On weekdays, people ride most often during commuting hours and lunchtime. Union Station is the center of scooting, but intense use extends down to Civic Center. Riders are also traveling down to West Colfax and up into Five Points. Dockless bikes are much less popular than scooters, even accounting for the smaller number of bikes. But bike riders tended to travel farther. The scooters are more popular when it’s warm. The average scooter saw three times more rides from August to November compared to the winter months. Denver police have reported 15 dockless-related crashes during the program. The fleets could be getting bigger, too. Effective Wednesday, each company’s cap will rise from 350 to about 440, an increase of 25 percent. That could happen again in April and July, depending on the strength of rider demand. However, half of the new scooters would have to be deployed to “opportunity areas” outside the downtown core. So far, the companies have concentrated on urban neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Five Points — both are considered opportunity areas — although a city map also showed three scooters deployed to Montbello. Two of the companies — Razor and Spin — were only using about a third of their allowable scooters as of January, though they started later than their rivals. “Denver has taken to scooters well,” wrote Ryan Larson, Spin’s general manager for Denver, in a statement to The Denver Post. “The overall amount of scooters on the streets is less than some cities where ridership has exploded (Austin, TX comes to mind) but for the fleet sizes, Denverites seem to find scooters as a useful form of transportation. With the Denver winter, we haven’t been able to see full ridership blossom, but we’re looking forward to spring to watch that happen.” The dockless rules are due for review in another six months, and the city hasn’t declared its experiment a success yet. While the scooters are getting a lot of use, it’s unclear if they’re taking vehicles off the road “or simply replacing walking trips, the new report says. The city also conducted an unscientific online poll of both riders and nonriders. Of about 2,000 people, more than 50 percent said they liked or loved the scooters, and another 26 percent said they would like them with some changes. About a third said they had been “hit or almost hit” by a scooter while walking. The city has tried to make riding safer with a new law that moves scooters from the sidewalks to the bike lanes after a Denver Post story about conflicts over where they should be used. About 43 percent of riders said their most recent scooter ride saved them from walking. About 32 percent said they would otherwise have paid for an automobile ride or driven themselves. Only about 7 percent said that the scooter ride replaced a transit ride. The most popular demand was simple: “More scooters available when you need them.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/02/13/denver-dockless-scooter-miles/
More than 60% of survey respondents have been involved in a crash or near-miss with an electric scooter,9 News,NBC,"Denver, CO",2019,3,25,"More than 60% of survey respondents have been involved in a crash or near-miss with an electric scooter. Just over 2,000 people responded to the City of Denver's online survey. Electric scooters hit the streets of Denver late last year, and this month, the city released data they've gathered about their usage. Since the city's pilot program launched in August, there have been an average of 4,693 scooter rides per weekday, according to data from Denver Public Works over the last few months. That number is slightly higher for weekends. There were 819,927 rides with 952,898 miles traveled. Over a two-week period in January, more than 2,000 people responded to an online survey by Denver Public Works. Electric scooter users and non-users were asked about their experiences during the first six months of its Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they had been involved in a crash or near-miss with an electric scooter. About two-thirds had been hit or almost hit by a scooter while walking. Twenty percent reported they had been hit or almost hit by a scooter when driving. The survey launched two weeks after Denver City Council passed an ordinance which moves electric scooter riders off the sidewalks and onto roads where the speed limit is 30 mph or less. On streets where the speed limit is greater than 30 mph and scooters are allowed on sidewalks, it reduces the speed at which users can ride to 6 mph or less to improve the feeling of safety for non-riders. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently launched its first-ever study of injuries related to scooters. The study is being done at the request of Austin, Texas city leaders. They'll work with Austin city leaders on analyzing 37 EMS calls and 68 injuries related to the dockless scooters that happened from September to November, according to KVUE.",https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/more-than-60-of-survey-respondents-have-been-involved-in-a-crash-or-near-miss-with-an-electric-scooter/73-8def0d9b-b20c-45d0-8bdd-f99848c382b0
Numbers of scooter injuries unclear in Denver,9 News,NBC,"Denver, CO",2019,4,3,"Numbers of scooter injuries unclear in Denver. We hear plenty of anecdotes about people getting hurt while riding scooters in Denver, but hard numbers on injuries have been hard to find. We hear plenty of anecdotes about people getting hurt while riding scooters in Denver, but hard numbers on injuries have been hard to find. Eight months into a pilot program regulating dockless scooters, it’s hard to pin down a number of how many people have been injured riding them. Though, we know people have been injured. Last week, Swedish Medical Center’s parent company HealthOne tweeted an estimate from an emergency room employee. She said the hospital sees about 20 scooter-related injuries a week. Denver Health - the closest emergency room to downtown Denver, where scooters get a lot of use - doesn’t have a numerical estimate. “We’re seeing people injured in scooter accidents at least several times a week,” said Dr. Eric Lavonas, an emergency physician at Denver Health. “Some of these injuries are minor – some are very serious.” “I’ve certainly seen people with broken wrists and broken ankles. I’ve also personally taken care of two patients with very devastating head injuries,” he said. When asked about injuries reported to Denver Public Works, the agency regulating scooter use in the city, a spokeswoman said the agency uses Denver Police numbers. A spokesman for Denver Police counted five injuries and one serious bodily injury involving scooters since August of last year. But Denver Police only investigate crashes they respond to, not the garden-variety spill that might leave someone with a broken wrist or broken ankle. And hospitals don’t have a specific mechanism to track dockless scooter accidents. “We have diagnoses codes for automobile crash and ski injury and bicycle crash. But electric scooters are simply too new to have a code,” Lavonas said. “In order to track them you’d have to look for the word scooter in electronic charts then go through by hand to make sure you’re finding the right ones.” “There’s no question that these electric scooters are a growing safety concern and the first step in dealing with any public health problem is to measure it and try to see what you can do to make thing better,” he said.",https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/numbers-of-scooter-injuries-unclear-in-denver/73-92d836f7-3b8a-4c30-be01-acb54e5f4b81
Denver Police Don’t Ticket People Who Ride Scooters on Sidewalks—at Least Not Yet,5280,,"Denver, CO",2019,5,9,"Denver Police Don’t Ticket People Who Ride Scooters on Sidewalks—at Least Not Yet. According to court records, no one in Denver has been cited for operating an e-scooter on the sidewalk, despite a new law that bans such behavior in most parts of the city. Riding an electric scooter on the sidewalk is one of the easiest laws to break in Denver. Despite a new ordinance that makes it illegal to ride the machines on most city sidewalks, anyone who has spent extended time downtown recently knows the restriction has done little to prevent such behavior. In fact, when we asked the Denver Police Department (DPD) how many tickets officers have written to people who scooter on sidewalks, a court administrator noted that zero citations have been filed in Denver County Court for such a violation. According to Doug Schepman, a DPD media relations specialist, officers at this time are concentrated on educating riders: “In other words,” he wrote via email, “contacting riders and discussing safe/legal operation.” Electric scooters first appeared in Denver about a year ago, when companies like Lime and Bird dropped their products on the city streets with little or no warning, prompting city officials to halt their operations temporarily. When the scooters returned in July, they did so under stricter regulations as part of a one-year Dockless Mobility Pilot Program created by Denver Public Works (DPW). But because certain issues persisted—such as users riding on sidewalks—Denver City Council drafted its own ordinance (which passed unanimously January 7) that requires the machines to be ridden in bike lanes or on roads rather than on sidewalks in most parts of the city—making Denver’s law similar to most other major American cities with e-scooters. At the time, although the ordinance was hailed as the right step in managing the future of mobility and protecting pedestrians, it was still unclear if and how it would be enforced. Councilman Paul Kashmann (District 6), who co-sponsored the bill in January, said at the time he and other City Council members would closely watch the situation to see how the ordinance would impact city infrastructure. When we spoke with Kashmann this week, he indicated that while he’s aware scooters are on still on sidewalks, he’s being patient and continuing to monitor how education efforts are working. He also noted that scooters and bicycles are both difficult to police because they often don’t use traditional rights-of-way and don’t lend themselves to typical means of enforcement. “I think it’s the nature of the beast,” Kashmann says. “We’re new into this world. And it’s going to take a while for us to work these potentially valuable means of travel into our transportation system in a way that truly complements it.” Kashmann says if the problem persists he’ll explore several ways of addressing it, including having discussions with the operating companies about their responsibility to educate riders, and by inviting DPW and DPD to City Council’s safety committee to present on the matter. Likewise, District 5 Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, who sponsored the ordinance with Kashmann, says she will consider having DPW and DPD come before the City Council’s Land Use, Transportation, and Infrastructure Committee, which she chairs. When Susman learned about the lack of citations, she inquired with DPD and was also told that officers are focused on education for now, which she thinks is probably the right course for the time being. “It seems fair,” she says, “to let people know there’s a new traffic rule they may not have known about.” Heather Burke, a public information specialist for DPW, provided the following statement to 5280: “Denver Police are authorized to write tickets if they see bad riding behavior or if a situation requires a citation (such as a crash). However, throughout the pilot, Denver Public Works has been focusing on education, as this new form of transportation has a learning curve. Denver Public Works will continue collaborating with Denver Police, and, as the pilot wraps up later this summer, we’ll be discussing the enforcement approach should there be an ongoing program after August 1.” While no one has yet been ticketed on a scooter in Denver, the lack of enforcement is in line with the way officers have policed sidewalks in the past. According to an anonymous police office who spoke with 5280 last summer, it is extremely rare for cyclists to be ticketed on sidewalks, particularly because the streets and bike lanes are not always safe places for people to ride. It’s still unclear if and when officers might begin ticketing scooter riders, but Schepman noted that the education efforts will be the main enforcement strategy for the near future.",https://www.5280.com/2019/05/denver-police-dont-ticket-people-who-ride-scooters-on-sidewalks-at-least-not-yet/
Boulder to temporarily ban commercial e-scooter companies ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,5,22,"Boulder to temporarily ban commercial e-scooter companies. Boulder has another temporary moratorium, this time on the issuance of business licenses to commercial electric scooter companies. During their Tuesday meeting, city council members passed a temporary moratorium — on emergency — to prohibit business licenses for scooter companies. It’s set to last about nine months, until Feb. 4. The moratorium will not prohibit the use of e-scooters on streets, but it will prohibit their use on sidewalks, multi-use trails and open space. E-scooter use was already illegal in Boulder, except on private property, but council passed the motion Tuesday in response to state legislation to allow e-scooters on streets. City staff and the majority of present council members reasoned the temporary moratorium would give them time to seek feedback from the community, study other communities and ensure the safety of riders who zip around Boulder. City Attorney Tom Carr pointed to the city’s process around short-term rentals. That process taught the city, he said, “Take your time. Hear from the community up front, and then engage in the process.” David Kemp, senior transportation planner, said staff are not opposed to the use of scooters but rather want to ensure that safety and right-of-way are taken into consideration. “We’re not against e-scooters,” Kemp said. “We see this as a new form of transportation.” Staff has said they want regulations in place to address various concerns, including injuries, especially head injuries; pollution, as the scooters have a 30-day street life; parking and storage; and data. “(W)hile the commercial e-scooter industry continues to evolve and improve, there remain significant areas of concern for municipalities, including public safety, right of way (in terms of storage and operations) and environmental issues,” staff wrote in a memo to council. Kemp also said demonstrations of the scooters, in which residents could ride e-scooters, and a potential pilot program in restricted areas could happen concurrently during the moratorium. Staff proposed a nine-month process to collect feedback from the community about what they’d like to see if commercial e-scooter companies are allowed in Boulder. The process also would include outreach, a poll and focus groups. Council in a 4-1 vote approved the temporary moratorium, though several council members urged expediency and expressed an interest in getting the project done before the Feb. 4 deadline. Mayor Suzanne Jones and council members Aaron Brockett and Mirabai Nagle were absent, and Councilwoman Lisa Morzel dissented. Council members Sam Weaver, Cindy Carlisle, Mary Young and Bob Yates voted in favor. “I would be in favor of a moratorium,” Yates said. “I thought I would never say that out loud. … However, I would like to make it as short as possible.” Carlisle said a moratorium “has the benefit of seeing what other communities have done.” Meanwhile, Weaver said the process would allow the city to holistically examine all micro-mobility options, not just e-scooters. “This is an attempt to make sure we’re asking for what we want so we get it provided by whichever businesses will operate here,” he said. Morzel voted against the moratorium, which she said she would have preferred expired before the November election. “I would like to get this into our options of transportation options as quickly as possible,” she said. “I think the summer is a great time to be trying this out because the weather is warm, and … the students are pretty much gone. We have less stress.” She also took issue with the terminology used to describe it. The city hurt itself by calling it a moratorium, she said. “If we could use different terminology, I would prefer to start it as a phased-in program where we’re doing pilots, we’re doing demonstrations, we’re doing community outreach,” she said. Two people took to the podium during public comment, both of whom spoke against the moratorium. Resident Matt Frommer said e-scooters would help the city do more to reduce its climate impact and fill transportation gaps. “The question is: Why is Boulder so far behind?” he said. “… I’m frustrated because we should have put together a plan last summer.” Andrea Meneghel, director of public affairs for the Boulder Chamber, urged a pilot program and quicker action. “Let’s get there quickly,” he said. “… Let’s move forward with regulations in a small pilot rather than imposing a lengthy moratorium.” ",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/22/boulder-to-temporarily-ban-commercial-e-scooter-companies/
"Boom in electric scooters leads to more injuries, fatalities ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,6,6,"Boom in electric scooters leads to more injuries, fatalities. A rough count by The Associated Press of media reports turned up at least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the U.S. since the beginning of 2018. Andrew Hardy was crossing the street on an electric scooter in downtown Los Angeles when a car struck him at 50 miles per hour and flung him 15 feet in the air before he smacked his head on the pavement and fell unconscious. The 26-year-old snapped two bones in each leg, broke a thighbone, shattered a kneecap, punctured a lung and fractured three vertebrae in his neck, in addition to sustaining a head injury. “My brother thought I was dead,” said Hardy, who wasn’t wearing a helmet. Doctors told Hardy he’d likely be paralyzed for life. Five months later, he has learned to walk again. But he says he’ll never ride another scooter. “These scooters should not be available to the public,” Hardy said. “Those things are like a death wish.” As stand-up electric scooters have rolled into more than 100 cities worldwide, many of the people riding them are ending up in the emergency room with serious injuries. Others have been killed. There are no comprehensive statistics available but a rough count by The Associated Press of media reports turned up at least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the U.S. since the beginning of 2018. Nine were on rented scooters and two on ones the victims owned. With summer fast approaching, the numbers will undoubtedly grow as more riders take to the streets. Despite the risks, demand for the two-wheeled scooters continues to soar, popularized by companies like Lime and Bird. In the U.S. alone, riders took 38.5 million trips on rentable scooters in 2018, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Riders adore the free-flying feel of the scooters that have a base the size of a skateboard and can rev up to 15 miles per hour. They’re also cheap and convenient, costing about $1 to unlock with a smartphone app and about 15 cents per minute to ride. And in many cities, they can be dropped off just about anywhere after a rider reaches their destination. But pedestrians and motorists scorn the scooters as a nuisance at best and a danger at worst. Cities, meanwhile, can hardly keep up. In many cases, scooter-sharing companies dropped them onto sidewalks overnight without warning. Regulations vary from place to place. In New York and the U.K., electric scooters are illegal on public roads and sidewalks, even though riders routinely flout the law. Last week in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, a rider was struck and killed by a car just one day after scooters were introduced there, leading to immediate calls for a ban. And in Nashville, Tennessee, where another rider was killed, the city’s mayor warned scooter operators they had 30 days to clean up their act or he would propose a ban. Fed up with the thousands of scooters flooding Paris streets, Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced new regulations Thursday limiting the number of scooter operators and imposing a 5 mile-per-hour speed limit in areas with heavy foot traffic. The city has already imposed a 135 euro ($150) fine on anyone who rides scooters on sidewalks. Isabelle Albertin, a pianist at Paris’ famed Opera Garnier, suffered a double fracture of her right arm after she was run down by an electric scooter on May 17. She is suing the city and has started an organization to push for a ban. “On the sidewalks of Paris, it’s a total madhouse. We pedestrians are totally insecure,” she told Le Parisien newspaper. Data on injuries or fatalities linked to scooters is hard to come by because the industry is so new. In Austin, Texas, public health officials working with the Centers for Disease Control counted 192 scooter-related injuries in three months in 2018. Nearly half were head injuries, including 15% that were traumatic brain injuries like concussions and bleeding of the brain. Less than 1% of the injured riders wore a helmet. Bird, one of the largest scooter-sharing companies, dropped its scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, California, in September 2017 and within a few months riders were showing up at the emergency room, according to Dr. Tarak Trivedi, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles and co-author of one of the first peer-reviewed studies of scooter injuries. The following year, Trivedi and his colleagues counted 249 scooter injuries, and more than 40% were head injuries. Just 4% were wearing a helmet. “I don’t think our roads are ready for this,” Trivedi said. Bird and Lime both recommend that riders wear helmets, and they’ve handed out tens of thousands for free. But last year, Bird successfully fought a California proposal that would have required helmets for adults, maintaining that scooters should follow the same laws as electric bikes that don’t require adult helmets. Bird says helmet requirements are off-putting to riders and could lead to fewer scooters on the road. Almost counterintuitively, the company argues that it’s better to have more riders than less because it forces drivers to pay attention to them. “There’s a safety in numbers effect, where the motorists know that there’s people out on the street, so they act accordingly,” said Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy for Bird. Getting people to wear helmets is a challenge. Riders don’t want exposure to lice or germs that could be found in shared helmets, and many make a spontaneous decision to scoot while they’re already out and about. That was the case when Drew Howerton, 19, hopped on a Lime scooter on a whim last October in Austin. He recalls signing a waiver that said he should wear a helmet, but he didn’t have one on him. “I didn’t show up in Austin thinking I’m going to ride a scooter today, better bring my helmet,” Howerton said. Scooter-sharing companies generally restrict riding to those 18 years and up, but some children, or their parents, have found ways around that. A 5-year-old boy died in Oklahoma after he fell from a scooter he was riding on with his mother and was struck by a car. Bird and Lime are taking steps to try to make scooters safer. After observing that scooter-related fatalities often occur after midnight when riders may have been drinking, Bird ceased operations after midnight. Lime halts rentals overnight in some markets but in most its scooters are available all night. Lime has also been updating the design of its scooters, with a broader wheel base and better suspension and braking; Bird is including more durable brakes and reinforced hardware to prevent failures. Both companies have been pushing cities for more bike lanes and better infrastructure as their riders navigate roads and traffic under conditions that were designed for cars and trucks. “The reality is, cars continue to kill more people annually than any other mode of transportation,” Lime said in a statement. “We must address this issue together with cities, get people out of their vehicles, and build cities that put people first, with smarter infrastructure to protect riders.” For Howerton, his first experience with a scooter left him scarred. Even though he read the warning not to ride downhill, he did it anyway since hills are hard to avoid in Austin. When he tried to brake, he flew off the scooter and hit his head on the pavement, blood gushing into his eyes. “These companies, for the large part, they show up in cities and they just kind of dump these rideshare devices,” Howerton said. “They tout them as this really cool, innovative, public transportation thing that’s cheap and affordable and yeah it is, but they’re dangerous and they don’t think about the potential health consequences.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/06/06/electric-scooters-booms-injuries-fatalities/
"Colorado Rockies ban scooter riding near Coors Field during games amid heavier traffic, face-first crash ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,7,18,"Colorado Rockies ban scooter riding near Coors Field during games amid heavier traffic, face-first crash. Bicyclists and skateboarders will have to dismount, too. If you’re riding a scooter to the ball game, you’ll have to walk a little at the end. The Colorado Rockies have banned people from riding scooters, bicycles and skateboards along Blake Street near Coors Field during games. The Rockies typically close sections of Blake Street and 21st Street to automobiles on game days. This season, riders are being asked to dismount and walk near the stadium starting about two hours before home games. Team officials declined to comment on the record about the new policy, but it comes amid heavier scooter traffic and a recent scooter crash near the stadium. The crash happened just before 9 p.m. on June 28, during a Rockies game against the L.A. Dodgers. The scooter rider was attempting to pass another scooter near Blake and 20th streets when her “handlebars got caught in the iron fence rail,” according to a police report. The woman fell from the scooter at an unknown speed and landed face-first on the sidewalk. She was knocked unconscious and taken to Denver Health by ambulance, the report states. Her identity wasn’t disclosed by police. It’s unclear whether the crash happened inside the closed portion of Blake; it was near the Monfort Companies office on 20th Street, the police report states. After “recent conflicts and near-misses involving pedestrians, the Rockies and DPD came together to step up education efforts around the need for people on bikes, scooters and skateboards to dismount,” wrote Nancy Kuhn, a spokesperson for Denver Public Works, in an email. Police are not currently ticketing people who break the rule, she added. Mobility advocate Jonathan Fertig said on Twitter this week that a police officer asked him to dismount his bicycle near the stadium, and that the officer blamed the change on a scooter crash. Denver police directed a reporter to the Rockies for comment on the policy. Fertig said it was troubling to see cyclists lose access to an area because of scooters, and said the city should instead close streets when cars kill people. A total of 59 people died in traffic crashes in Denver in 2018, according to city data, including five bicyclists and 19 pedestrians.

It’s Been One Year Since Electric Scooters Officially Landed in Denver,5280,,"Denver, CO",2019,7,31,"It’s Been One Year Since Electric Scooters Officially Landed in Denver. And what a year it's been. Sure, electric scooters technically first arrived in Denver in May 2018, when they were dropped off downtown without warning (and subsequently confiscated by officials within weeks). But the real anniversary of the Mile High City’s scooter-mania can be marked by the year-long Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program, which was unveiled in late July 2018 and has allowed for nearly 3,000 scooters from five companies to operate in the city. While the pilot was supposed to expire on August 1, 2019, it was recently extended until an ongoing permit program launches in September. This means that the electrified two-wheelers will be cruising our streets (and sidewalks and trails, despite regulations) for the foreseeable future. Whether you love them or hate them—and if you live or work downtown, we’re guessing you have a strong opinion about them—the scooters have altered Denver’s transportation infrastructure since arriving last year. Here, we take a look back at the biggest e-scooter developments over the past 12 months. The More the (Maybe Not) Merrier: September to October 2018 After seeing the popularity Bird and Lime scooters in Denver, other major operators unveiled their own fleets. First was Lyft; the ride sharing giant unveiled its first scooters on September 6 and grew its number to 350 over several months. Razor, the company best known for kick scooters, then deployed 350 scooters in early October. Spin, the last of the bunch, launched its own flock of scooters on October 19 and was acquired by Ford Motor Co. a few weeks later. Over the course of the year, the total number of licensed scooters in Denver swelled from 1,750 at the beginning of the program to 2,840 early this year. (The actual number of scooters operating in the city is unknown, as some of the companies licensed to operate here have not met their cap.) Mild Chaos Ensues: Fall 2018 Some people loved scooters; some people hated them. Some people rode them on sidewalks; some people rode them in the street. Some riders were slapped by pedestrians; others tossed the machines in the Platte River. After several months, it was clear Denver’s city government needed to revisit scooter regulations; namely the outdated ordinance that classified the machines as “toy vehicles” and mandated they be ridden on sidewalks. Older and disabled residents in particular, like our downtown neighbor Billy LoDo, targeted city government as well as the scooter companies and demanded they remove the machines from the streets (or at least, to stop dropping them off in front of the Volunteers of America building, where he lives). Sidewalks No More: January 2019 Denver’s Department of Public Works had been planning to address scooters operating on sidewalks, but the issue was ultimately taken up by Councilman Paul Kashmann and former City Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, who co-sponsored an ordinance that revised city rules. The updated ordinance classified the machines as “electric mobility scooters,” allowing them to operate in bike lanes or roadways where the speed limit is 30 mph or less. If there is no bike lane and the speed limit is higher than 30 mph, the scooters may be ridden on a sidewalk at a speed no greater than 6 mph. One Million Miles: February 2019 After six months of the pilot program, DPW released a mid-way report. By February, the city was seeing about 5,000 scooter rides per day and riders had logged nearly one million miles. Union Station, according to the report, was the most popular spot for scooting, with high numbers also in Five Points and along West Colfax. It was at this time that the cap on fleet sizes expanded from 350 per company to 440. Lack Of Enforcement: May 2019 Five months after the city ordinance was revised and scooters continued buzzing along sidewalks, our research found that the Denver Police Department had written zero tickets to people who weren’t following the updated regulation. Rather than writing tickets and issuing fines, DPD said it was focused on “contacting riders and discussing safe, legal operation,” a spokesperson told 5280. Coors Field Outlaws Scooters: June 2019 In response to a scooter collision outside the ballpark on June 28—in which one woman was knocked unconscious—Coors Field officials began asking scooter riders (as well as bicyclists and skateboarders) to dismount while crossing through sections of closed streets on game days, the Denver Post reported. Scooters Are Here To Stay: July 2019 With only two weeks remaining before the Dockless Mobility Pilot Program was set to expire, DPW announced the scooters are sticking around for good. The original pilot program was extended into August, after which it will be replaced by a permanent permit system—details of which are yet to be released.",https://www.5280.com/2019/07/its-been-one-year-since-electric-scooters-officially-landed-in-denver/
"Electric scooters banned from Denver sidewalks, city council votes",9 News,NBC,"Denver, CO",2019,8,6,"Electric scooters banned from Denver sidewalks, city council votes. Riders need to follow the same rules as people on bikes by riding in the street and designated bike lanes. Denver City Council on Monday night voted to prohibit the use of electric scooters on city sidewalks. Denver Public Works (DPW) recommended the ordinance change earlier this month. The change means scooter riders need to follow the same rules as people on bikes and electric bikes by riding in the street or in designated bike lanes. Scooters, however, can still be parked on sidewalks. ""If Mayor Hancock signs the new standup electric scooter ordinance into effect, the Denver Police Department will first focus on providing training to officers on proper enforcement,"" DPD said in a statement in response to city council's decision. ""In the early stages of implementation, DPD will continue focusing on educating riders on safe and legal operation before phasing in citations, when appropriate."" DPW spokeswoman Heather Burke in a news release earlier this month said, “Based on rider behavior observed and feedback received through Denver’s Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program, Denver Public Works made an ordinance change recommendation ... to Denver City Council’s Land Use, Transportation & Infrastructure Committee to prohibit electric scooters on sidewalks."" DPW, when the change was suggested, said the move would more closely align with state law signed in May and would provide consistency for law enforcement. Under the new rules, the Denver Police Department could also start issuing citations to riders who violate the law. The Dockless Mobility Vehicle Pilot Permit Program started last summer and was set to end July 31. Last month, DPW announced that the pilot program would now run through August to allow details of the ongoing program to be finalized. There are currently 2,840 electric scooters and 500 dockless bikes permitted for use in the city through the pilot program. The current ordinance allows electric scooters to operate in bike lanes and streets with speed limits of 30 mph or less. If either of those aren’t an option, electric scooters can operate on the sidewalk, traveling at a speed of 6 mph or less.

Atlanta bans electric scooters at night after deadly wrecks ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,8,8,"Atlanta bans electric scooters at night after deadly wrecks. Atlanta is banning electric scooters in the nighttime hours during what’s been a deadly summer for riders. The ban comes as cities across the nation struggle to regulate the companies renting the devices and keep riders safe. In Atlanta, three riders have died since May in crashes that involved a public bus, an SUV and a car. Police in the Atlanta suburb of East Point say a fourth rider was killed there Tuesday in a collision involving his scooter and a truck. “Sadly, we have seen a pattern in the recent and tragic fatalities involving scooters — they all occurred after sunset,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a statement Thursday. City officials on Thursday announced a ban on electric scooters and electric bikes from 9 p.m. until 4 a.m. daily. The ban takes effect Friday. “This environment didn’t exist 14 months ago or 12 months ago — this is a brand new thing,” Tim Keane, Atlanta’s commissioner of city planning, said in an interview Thursday. “We want this to be temporary,” he said. “We hope that this ban is very temporary.” City officials have asked e-scooter vendors to disable the devices during the hours they’re banned, the mayor said. The companies are cooperating, and “I’ve heard no pushback at all,” Keane said. “We think it’s a reasonable step as a temporary measure while the scooter program is re-examined,” said Nima Daivari, Lime’s community affairs manager for Georgia. San Francisco-based Lime has one of the largest fleets in Atlanta, with an average of about 1,800 available for rent last month. “They see the value here, and Atlanta is a city that’s notorious for traffic congestion.” Traffic safety data showing the dangers of riding during late-night hours is “compelling,” Santa Monica, California-based Bird said in a statement Thursday. It had more than 1,200 devices operating in Atlanta last month, city records show. Late-night and early-morning travel, especially between midnight and 5 a.m., is “many times more dangerous due to impaired road users, fatigue and poor visibility,” Bird said. The company has managed its service hours to avoid late night riding, and will comply with Atlanta’s new guidelines, it added. Jason Layfield was visiting Atlanta from Guam on Thursday, and rode a motorized scooter for the first time to get back and forth from his hotel and the convention he’s attending. “I don’t see it necessarily as a bad thing to limit riding at night,” he said. “I don’t know that that’s 100% necessary, but I can understand how it may be a good idea.” Other communities, including Dallas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Athens, Georgia, have recently considered some form of regulation of scooters, partly over concerns about safety. Chicago has a nighttime ban similar to Atlanta’s new policy. Scooters there must be inoperable after 10 p.m. and off the streets by midnight, said Isaac Reichman, a Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection spokesman. They’re allowed to operate at 5 a.m. the next day, he said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed medical records from scooter riders in Austin, Texas, in an effort to learn more about the risks associated with riding them. Researchers in the Austin study identified 192 scooter-related injuries in three months in 2018. Nearly half of those were head injuries, including 15% that were traumatic brain injuries, the CDC said in its report. The researchers also found a troubling trend: Less than 1% of the injured riders wore a helmet. Safety concerns are driving the nighttime bans in both Chicago and Atlanta, officials said. “We embrace scooters and bikes and we want people to be able to get around on them, particularly people who are starting to depend on them for access to transit and their jobs and things like that,” Keane said. “Where we have the chance to make them safer, we have to do that.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/08/atlanta-bans-electric-scooters-at-night/
Denver experiences its first reported fatal scooter crash ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,8,12,"Denver experiences its first reported fatal scooter crash. The fatality comes as the city wraps up a year-long pilot program that focuses on rider safety. Denver reported its first fatal scooter accident Monday, just as the city winds down a year-long pilot program that focuses on how safe they are for riders and others on city streets. Cameron D. Hagan, 26, of Billings, Mont., was riding a Lyft scooter when he collided with a 2018 Honda Civic on the evening of Aug. 4, according to a traffic report released Monday by the Denver Police Department. He died Friday, police said. “The scooter driver rode into oncoming traffic,” Downs said. No one is being charged in connection to the collision, Downs said. It is the first known fatal scooter crash in the city since the dockless, electric vehicles were introduced in June 2018, Christine Downs, a Denver police spokeswoman, said. Denver Public Works is finalizing a study of scooter-related accidents involving patients treated within the Denver Health system, Nancy Kuhn, a public works spokeswoman, said. “Denver police are tracking scooter crashes,” she said. An emergency room physician told The Denver Post that he estimates there have been hundreds of scooter-related injuries in Denver during the pilot program. But a final report scheduled for release in September will include an injury tally, Kuhn said. The collision involving Hagan happened in the 2800 block of West 32nd Avenue on the evening of Aug. 4, according to a Monday Denver police tweet. Hagan was riding a gray scooter eastbound in the westbound lanes of West 32nd Avenue while attempting to cross the street directly in front of the Honda, the traffic report said. When the car struck Hagan’s scooter he was thrown off and landed on the south curb of the street, the traffic report said. The name of the 27-year-old female Honda driver, a Denver resident, was redacted. Hagan was not wearing a helmet at the time of the crash, said Technician Jay Casillas, Denver police spokesman. Denver Public Works encourages scooter riders to wear helmets, Kuhn said. Lyft spokeswoman Lauren Alexander wrote in a statement Monday that safety is fundamental to the company, which provides tutorials and offers helmets to riders. “We stand ready to work with local officials to continue making streets safer for everyone,” Alexander’s statement said. Dr. Eric Lavonas, emergency room physician for Denver Health Medical Center, said he sees people who have been injured in scooter crashes almost every day and much more frequently than he sees injured bicyclists. The injuries range from scratches to broken ribs, legs and arms to traumatic brain injuries. “There are a lot of people getting injured and a lot of serious injuries,” Lavonas said. “Helmets can reduce most but not all serious head injuries. Most people on bicycles wear helmets, but very few people on scooters are wearing them.” Lavonas said he believes the small front wheels of scooters don’t handle road bumps and pot holes as well as bicycles do, leading to more scooter wrecks than bike crashes. He recommends that riders respect the fact that scooters offer no protection, that helmets are a must and that brain injuries can be life altering. “Please wear a helmet and don’t ever get on a scooter when you are intoxicated,” Lavonas said. While Hagan’s death is the first scooter-related fatality in Denver, others have died on the electric vehicles in other cities. A 26-year-old died in Nashville, Tenn., in June after being struck by an SUV, and police there also blamed the rider, saying he had a blood alcohol level that was twice the legal limit, the Tennessean newspaper reported. Last fall, the Centers for Disease Control studied scooter-related injuries in an attempt to measure the public health impact. During an 87-day study in Austin, Texas, researchers found 271 people were injured, according to an online abstract of the report. Scooters have become increasingly more popular in the city since August 2018 when Denver approved their use on city streets during a one-year pilot program. As of Aug. 2, there have been nearly 2.7 million scooter rides in Denver, covering nearly 3.5 million miles, Kuhn said. An average of 5,786 trips were taken each day, Kuhn said. Up for debate Coincidentally, the topic of scooters was up for debate Monday evening at an event hosted by Streetsblog Denver. Attendees marked the news of the death with a moment of silence. The city’s focus on bike lanes will make scooters safer, said Nick Williams, deputy chief of staff for Denver Public Works. Meanwhile, Denver is “absolutely interested” in creating public education program to be funded by the companies. “They’re literally new for everyone. No one grew up riding electric scooters at 15 mph,” Williams said. Patrick Quintana, a representative for Lyft, said the company would host a “big, big campaign” to educate riders and give away helmets. Jill Locantore, executive director of WalkDenver, said that, whether or not the crash was the rider’s fault, it pointed to the need for safer streets with separated scooter and bike lanes. “We can do something about those conditions,” she said. The forum also brought complaints about the hazards created by scooters and other dockless vehicles left on city sidewalks, which is particularly challenging for people with disabilities. Gary Van Dorn of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition also asked whether the scooters could generate a sound to make them more obvious to blind people and others. Denver is preparing to permanently allow dockless scooter companies to operate in Denver. They’re currently operating under a temporary pilot program.

Man dies after Denver scooter crash as city ponders new rules ,Colorado Politics,,"Denver, CO",2019,8,13,"Man dies after Denver scooter crash as city ponders new rules. Police say a man has died after he collided with a car while riding an electric scooter in Denver last week. Cameron Hagan, 26, of Billings, Montana, crashed the Lyft scooter on Aug. 4. Denver police say Hagan was riding ""carelessly"" when the collision threw him from the scooter and he landed on a street curb. Denver police spokeswoman Christine Downs says Hagan rode into oncoming traffic. Downs says the deadly scooter crash is the first in the city since the scooters were introduced in June 2018. Downs says no charges are being pursued in connection to the crash. The death comes as city officials have been discussing tighter rules on scooter operations. Denver Public Works has made an ordinance-change recommendation to the Denver City Council to prohibit the use of electric scooters on city sidewalks. If the change is approved, scooter riders would need to follow the same rules as people on bikes and electric bikes by riding in the street or in designated bike lanes. DPW referred the ordinance change recommendation to the city council for consideration later this month. DPW said the move would more closely align the city with state law signed in May and would provide consistency for law enforcement. Under the new rules, Denver police could start issuing citations to riders who violate the law.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/denver/man-dies-after-denver-scooter-crash-as-city-ponders-new-rules/article_0c70dde2-bdc9-11e9-897a-33870a0cd472.html
Editorial: Denver needs to get scooters under control ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,8,17," Editorial: Denver needs to get scooters under control. The electric scooters littered all over Denver’s streets and sidewalks have proven to be unsafe nuisances. It’s time for city officials to retake control of the situation. Earlier this month 26-year-old Cameron Hagan was killed in a crash while riding a scooter owned by Lyft, one of the companies that leave dockless motorized scooters around the city for rent electronically. According to police reports, Hagan collided with a Honda Civic and died several days later. While this is the first death since the scooters were introduced in June 2018, we fear it won’t be the last. These devices travel relatively fast and are offered for rent with no helmets and no prior experience necessary. A study is underway into injuries that have occurred involving the scooters, and while it’s sensible to wait for the final report to be released next month, we think the city should start drafting some measures now based on the writing already scattered on the sidewalk. Dr. Eric Lavonas, an emergency room physician for Denver Health Medical Center, told The Denver Post that he sees injuries almost every day ranging from scratches to broken bones and traumatic brain injuries. “There are a lot of people getting injured and a lot of serious injuries,” Lavonas told Post reporters for a story this week. “Helmets can reduce most but not all serious head injuries. Most people on bicycles wear helmets, but very few people on scooters are wearing them.” Wearing helmets is always a good idea, but there are a number of ways to make the scooters safer. For example, the city could set a maximum speed limit for the devices when they are being offered for rent on city streets based on crash evidence and require the scooters have speed limiters installed. Given that the city is providing the scooters with basically free parking currently (Denver has collected $128,250 in permit fees from Bird, Lime, Lyft, Razor and Spin) we think adding basic safety requirements makes sense. Which is a segue into another problem. These scooters are being left smack-dab in the middle of sidewalks and causing inconveniences and hazards. For those with disabilities who are unable to easily move a badly parked scooter out of the way, it’s more than an inconvenience. The city should require that these scooters be parked in designated spaces (we must disclose here that a Denver Post employee was badly injured recently when she tripped on a parked scooter while walking in a crowd down a Denver sidewalk). Already city officials have looked into creating parking spaces for the scooters. There are small pockets of unused spaces here and there that could be acceptable, but scooter riders can no longer operate under the drop it anywhere modus operandi. These scooter companies seem willing and ready to work with the city to make their business model work. Now the city just has to start asking a little more of them in exchange for allowing their product on our public streets and sidewalks.",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/17/editorial-denver-needs-to-get-scooters-under-control/

Denver bans electric scooters from sidewalks in most cases ,Center Square Colorado,Center Square,"Denver, CO",2019,8,28,"Denver bans electric scooters from sidewalks in most cases. Although nearly half of the 51 scooter crashes reported by police since June 2018 involved another motor vehicle, the Denver City Council this week unanimously passed an ordinance to ban electric scooters from sidewalks. The new ordinance approved Monday leaves out an exception for when a driver is getting on or off the vehicle. It also permits scooter drivers on sidewalks when necessary as long as they don’t exceed six miles per hour. The ordinance also changes the legal name of the vehicle from electric mobility scooter to electric scooter. Under the ordinance, the vehicle has been redefined as, “A device that weighs less than one hundred pounds with handlebars that is powered by an electric motor and that has a maximum speed of twenty miles per hour on a paved level surface when powered solely by the electric motor.” The ordinance also excludes electrical assisted bicycles, motorcycles, low-power scooters and EPAMDs (Electronic Personal Assistive Mobility Device powered by a battery). Riding on sidewalks is permitted if the sidewalk is part of a designated bicycle route or the driver is embarking or disembarking, and drivers must yield to pedestrians. The new ordinance no longer permits the scooter driver to have a passenger. The new ordinance in addition allows electric scooters to park at any angle to the curb or edge of the roadway where parking is permitted, and can be docked alongside another electric scooter, bicycle, or electrical assisted bicycle if it does not impede the flow of traffic. Denver isn’t the first Colorado city to ban scooters on sidewalks. Earlier this month, Breckenridge outright banned businesses from renting e-scooters in the city. Denver’s ban comes after an Aug. 4 incident when Cameron Hagan, a 26-year-old from Montana visiting the city, plowed into an oncoming car while on his scooter. An eyewitness said the scooter was sliced in half. Hagan was the first person to die in an electric scooter accident in Denver. Mayor Michael Hancock is expected to sign the ordinance into law this week.",https://www.thecentersquare.com/colorado/denver-bans-electric-scooters-from-sidewalks-in-most-cases/article_87cd45ee-c9cb-11e9-97dc-838e91751b54.html
Boulder e-scooter demos helping city officials craft regulations to end ban ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,9,19,"Boulder e-scooter demos helping city officials craft regulations to end ban. Where, when and how vehicles can be ridden under consideration. E-scooter businesses have their sights set on Boulder, and city officials are prepping for their arrival. Despite a temporary ban on e-scooter companies operating in the city, packs of riders have been rolling up and down streets for a couple hours at a time over the last two weeks, including midday Wednesday. The Boulder Chamber hosted one of five demonstrations on Wednesday in the Flatiron Business Park off of 55th Street with several e-scooter companies present with vehicles ready to test ride. Dozens of workers in the multi-building office complex turned out to take a spin, and some tried more than one or all of the five e-scooter brands featured at the event. “This saves a lot of time, especially for a person like me who doesn’t own a car,” Monkek Thind said after testing a scooter. “This is going to help a lot (during lunch hour), actually.” University of Colorado Boulder last week held similar e-scooter test runs on campus, while the city hosted two Monday and Tuesday on 13th Street near the Dushanbe Teahouse. A final e-scooter demo is planned for 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday at the Center for Community, 2249 Willard Loop Drive. “I was a little bit terrified at first,” Jillian Morrow said after a test drive Wednesday. “It was faster than I thought. Once I got the hang of it, it was lots of fun.” City council in May imposed a moratorium on issuing business licenses to e-scooter companies through February 2020, giving Boulder staffers time to propose regulations on where, when and how the electric vehicles can be ridden. “We know we don’t want them on sidewalks,” Boulder Senior Transportation Planner Dave Kemp said. He added city officials are looking into regulatory proposals that could prohibit e-scooter use on major arterial roads lacking bike lanes, in addition to disallowing e-scooters before dawn and after dusk, to prevent, in part, drunken operation as well as riding in the dark. But all the considerations are preliminary, and any rules will have to gain council approval to trigger an end to the moratorium. “Safety is paramount,” Kemp said. “… It would behoove us to have, if not a law, encouragement of helmet use. Denver is playing catchup on building regulations for e-bikes and e-scooters. We’re going to build the most constructive regulations for council consideration.” Boulder resident Caitlin Jacobsen earlier this year was involved in an e-scooter crash after leaving Coors Field in Denver, and was in a medically induced coma for some time after the incident. Her sister, Jennifer Jacobsen, last month testified to Boulder City Council that the woman’s condition remained serious and urged the city to approach e-scooters with extreme caution. Despite the tragedy, hopes are high for e-scooters, along with e-bike sharing and micro-transit options, such as cars smaller than buses, to be part of the formula to deter Boulder-based employees from driving into work, Kemp and Boulder Chamber leaders said. Their availability near Boulder bus stops for regional routes could tilt the scales in favor of transit over single-occupancy vehicles, giving bus riders a convenient option to complete the “first and last miles” of their trips without walking or sweating through their work clothes while pedaling a standard bike, and help draw down transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions from Boulder residents and workers. In 2018, people took 38.5 million trips on shared e-scooters in the United States, according to a National Association of City Transportation Officials report. “Our goal is to fully explore all possible opportunities to improve mobility for Boulder’s workforce and residents,” Boulder Chamber Director of Public Affairs Andrea Meneghel said. Kemp also said the city will be looking to e-scooter companies to gear their smartphone applications to promote good behavior by riders when it comes to parking and cruising in properly designated areas, perhaps by warning users they could be charged higher fees for bad placement or riding habits picked up on by companies’ location tracking technology. The city also is looking to ensure equitable access to e-scooters and e-bike sharing programs by finding ways to get them into the hands of residents and employees who could use them, but may not have a smartphone model able to start up a scooter, or a credit card to plug into a mobile application, Kemp said. “They’re getting the full shakedown, but ultimately we see the value,” Kemp said.",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/09/19/boulder-e-scooter-demo-regulation/
Lime’s new Denver scooters are supposedly better at winter riding and at fighting sidewalk riding,Denverite,NPR,"Denver, CO",2019,11,4,"Lime’s new Denver scooters are supposedly better at winter riding and at fighting sidewalk riding. They’re not exactly snow tires, but they’re bigger. Electric scooter-share company Lime says the tech on its new Denver fleet will make riding safer with hardware meant for winter and software meant to curb high-speed sidewalk riding, but Denver Public Works says no company in the country has proven its tech good enough to end the illegal practice. Scooter lovers might be happy to hear that the zippy devices now have bigger wheels and front-wheel suspension, like on a mountain bike, meant to absorb bumps and make the ride smoother. They’re also more durable in general, according to Lime, with an aluminum frame and a more waterproof sheath. Batteries will last 50 percent and up to 30 miles longer, the company says, and the new model has three ways to brake. Scooter haters might be happy to hear that the vehicles are outfitted with better “geofencing” technology — essentially an invisible fence that deters people from riding and parking illegally using GPS. Previous models had the tech, but this version is supposedly more accurate. “We are constantly developing tech to understand sidewalk riding and so this new line of scooters allows us to test that as we head into various markets,” said Alex Youn, a Lime spokesman. “The goal in the future is some sort of notification that says people shouldn’t be riding on the sidewalk.” The tech is proprietary, Youn said. The company calls it “a wifi-enhanced location technique.” Previous models had the geofencing tech too, in part because Denver Public Works requires it. It’s in use on the 16th Street Mall, where scooters automatically slow down because they’re not allowed on the transitway. If Lime members park on the mall, their credit card will be charged until the scooter is moved. Geofencing has been helpful, Denver Public Works officials said. Mall riding has drastically decreased. But the 16th Street Mall is special — most streets aren’t designed to allow that level of accuracy. “We’re saying it’s more of a hand grenade instead of a sniper rifle at this point,” said Cindy Patton, an advisor in DPW’s policy office. Nicholas Williams, deputy chief of staff for the streets department, likes the technology despite its shortcomings. “The dream is to be able to geofence every little area you want them and you don’t want, ideally, but it’s not all there yet and super accurate.” Lime is well aware of Denver’s desire to end sidewalk riding and parking that blocks the path for pedestrians. Youn said tech is only part of the solution. The other part, he said, is safe places to ride like bike lanes. “It’s important to note why people ride on sidewalks — because they don’t feel safe,” he said. Lime is tied for Denver’s largest scooter fleet with Lyft at 685.",https://denverite.com/2019/11/04/lime-scooters-denver-winter/
"Denver B-cycle to end, city may thin herd of scooter operators as it tightens regulation of “micromobility” services ",Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2019,11,12,"Denver B-cycle to end, city may thin herd of scooter operators as it tightens regulation of “micromobility” services. City to move from permitting system to taking bids for contracts for scooters, e-bikes and bike shares in 2020. Denver B-cycle, the city’s first shared mobility system, will ride off into the sunset early next year amid declining ridership and a new plan by Denver Public Works to overhaul how the scooters, bike shares and electric bicycles scattered across downtown are regulated. Denver is pumping the brakes on its pilot program for shared scooters, electric bikes and dockless bicycles, trading the current permitting system for a competitive bid process that will result in “one or more companies” landing a contract with the city to operate so-called “micromobility” services, Denver Public Works announced Thursday. “Having a contract really gives us more control on what kind of operation we want to have in the city for this type of mobility,” said Heather Burke, spokeswoman for Denver Public Works. “It allows us to put stricter guidelines in place. It helps us facilitate a stronger structure for shared vehicles in the city, and it also allows us to have well-defined rules and expectations.” The city hasn’t determined how many contracts it will extend to scooter operators, but said it may be fewer than the five companies currently in Denver: Bird, Lime, Lyft, Razor and Spin, which operate more than 2,700 scooters combined. Denver also plans to contract with a new docked bike share to replace B-cycle, but it’s anticipated there will be a months-long gap without such an option in the city. Officials expect to have the new contracts in place over the summer of 2020. The city’s request for proposals, which will outline what Denver is looking for out of its contracted operators, is still being finalized and will be released at the end of January. Scooter and e-bike companies currently permitted to operate in the city will keep rolling with Denver’s Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program until the city’s contracted vendors begin operation. Uber, which operates 500 Jump-brand electric bikes in the city, said Thursday that it plans to enter into the bidding process. If awarded a contract, the operator hopes to continue offering its bike services and add scooters to its fleet, according to Stephanie Sedlak, an Uber spokeswoman. Spin, which has 438 scooters in Denver, expressed a similar sentiment. “We look forward to reviewing the RFP and plan to submit a proposal, in the coming months, that addresses the transportation needs of Denverites,” spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski said. B-cycle ridership down One operator that no will longer cruise the streets: Denver B-cycle, owned and operated by the nonprofit Denver Bike Sharing. The first shared riding option of its time in the city, Denver B-cycle will cease spinning its wheels on Jan. 30 after nine years in operation, in part because it has lost business to the electric scooters zooming around the city. Talor Meyer, a carless 27-year-old, has taken more than 800 B-cycle trips this year and considers the departing program his primary source of transportation. He uses scooters on occasion, he said, but prefers B-cycle because of its annual pass option and the reliability of knowing there’s a docking station outside his work and a bike will always be there. “I don’t really know what I’m going to do when it’s gone,” Meyer said. “I’m hesitant to buy my own bike because my old bike got stolen. I imagine I’ll use scooters more and the Jump bikes, if they’re around. I’ll use more public transportation and just walk, I guess.” Denver B-cycle usage has been headed downhill since its peak in annual ridership in 2014, declining 19% — from 377,229 riders to 305,440 riders — in 2018, according to the operator’s annual report. “For years, the Denver B-cycle system relied on tourists and walk-up customers to subsidize ridership of Denver residents,” Denver B-cycle said in a news release. “That business has declined due to competition over the last two years.” The original ride-share system is also aging and needs to be replaced, said Denver Bike Share executive director Mike Pletsch. The service added 29 docking stations in 2012 and 2013, but has only installed seven new stations since then, bringing the city’s total to 89. New stations can cost $50,000 and bikes can come in at around $1,000 each. “Upgrading our current product is not financially viable,” Pletsch said. “Our contract with B-cycle LLC is up in the end of January, so, unfortunately, there will be a gap in the service as we move through this transition.” Current holders of the “5280” pass, which provided residents unlimited free rides of 60 minutes or less, can keep using their passes through Jan. 30, city officials said. Spencer McCullough, who rides a bike he scored at a yard sale, said he was glad to hear Denver B-cycle acknowledge the system was out of date and wished the city would spend money dedicated to bikes on biking infrastructure instead. “I’d like to see us stop focusing on the bikes themselves and on giving us a place to ride them,” he said. Other two-wheeled options To bridge the B-cycle gap, cyclists can turn to other options available in the city, such as the 500 electric Jump bikes sprinkled throughout the downtown area. Under the new program, Burke said scooter aficionados are not likely to notice much change in their day-to-day rides other than, potentially, fewer scooter operators on the streets. City staff established a temporary set of rules in the summer of 2018 after the companies shocked Denver’s government by deploying the vehicles without permission. The year-long “pilot program” was meant to test how riders would behave, and how the city might manage thousands of scooters and electric bikes. “Only contracted vendors are going to be allowed to operate through this new system,” Burke said. “There wouldn’t be other companies able to just drop here. Last year, when Bird and Lime just dropped their vehicles, we didn’t have any kind of rules and regulations in place for electric scooters, so we asked them to remove their vehicles off the streets as we developed a pilot permit program. “We tried to find a way to permit these vehicles in the city … but we decided to take a different approach because it’ll help us make sure we’re getting the most qualified operators and make this more of a partnership.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/21/denver-bcycle-scooters-bike-share/
Teens recorded riding scooters across thin ice on Denver pond,Fox Denver,Fox,"Denver, CO",2020,1,2,"Teens recorded riding scooters across thin ice on Denver pond. Video shows teens riding electric scooters across thin ice on a Denver pond. FOX31 crews recorded two people riding electric scooters across the frozen surface Thursday at Barnum Park. “I’ve never seen anything like that before, scooters on the ice,” said Cpt. Travis Hopwood with West Metro Fire Rescue. The video is concerning to firefighters at West Metro because most ponds and lakes in the metro area are just starting to freeze over. “The big risk is you have no idea what the stability of the ice is,” said Hopwood. Hopwood says West Metro typically responds to three to five ice rescues every winter, often during weeks like this in early winter when the ice is just starting to form. “I would discourage anyone from getting out onto a lake,” said Hopwood. On Wednesday, firefighters in Boulder sprang into action to save a woman who fell into an icy lake trying to rescue her dog. The two boys on scooters in Denver did not fall in, but Hopwood hopes the video of them on the ice will serve as a reminder to all to stay off ponds and lakes. “Unless you dove in or watched it being built, you shouldn’t assume it’s six feet or 50 feet. This can go from ‘They’re having a great time’ to ‘They’re submerged in the water.’ They have no idea how deep that is,” Hopwood said.",https://kdvr.com/news/local/teens-recorded-riding-scooters-across-thin-ice-on-denver-pond/
Electric scooter injuries surge along with their popularity ,Denver Post,MediaNews,"Denver, CO",2020,1,8," Electric scooter injuries surge along with their popularity. Electric scooter injuries have surged along with their popularity in the United States, nearly tripling over four years, researchers said in a study published Wednesday. Nearly 40,000 broken bones, head injuries, cuts and bruises resulting from scooter accidents were treated in U.S. emergency rooms from 2014 through 2018, the research showed. The scooter injury rate among the general U.S. population climbed from 6 per 100,000 to 19 per 100,000. Most occurred in riders aged 18 to 34, and most injured riders weren’t hospitalized. For the study published in JAMA Surgery, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed U.S. government data on nonfatal injuries treated in emergency rooms. “Improved rider safety measures and regulation” are clearly needed, the researchers said. Media reports have linked the stand-up electric scooters with more than a dozen U.S. deaths within the past few years. The trend follows the emergence of rental companies in cities around the world that let customers rent scooters through smartphone apps and drop them off anywhere in the same city. Some cities have adopted nighttime bans and other restrictions amid rising injuries and complaints about scooters traveling or parked on sidewalks. “Scooters promote active commuting,” could help spur wider public transit use and could lead to less traffic congestion, said lead author Dr. Benjamin Breyer. “We hope to raise awareness that riders should wear helmets and ride safely.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2020/01/08/electric-scooter-injuries/

Electronic scooter companies are divided on what to do in the middle of a pandemic. Of the five companies permitted to operate within the city, Bird and Lime had removed their scooters from the city’s streets entirely as of Friday, while Lyft, Spin and Razor scooters happily awaited their next ride. Lime, with around 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, released a statement on March 21, saying it planned to “begin winding down and pausing service to reflect public health guidance” in all of its markets except for South Korea. Bird’s app also shows no scooters available locally. The company did not respond to BusinessDen’s request for a comment. Lyft, which did pause operations in Miami at the request of the city, continues to operate in Denver. Those who log into the app see a cautionary message: “Please take care of yourself, wash your hands before and after riding, and only travel for essential purposes.” The company said in a regulatory filing last month that the pandemic has delayed production for certain bike and scooter parts. Spin, which is owned by Ford, did not respond to a request for comment. The company released a statement on March 23 confirming that operations would continue in cities “where we can make an impact and where the city is supporting our efforts to provide a transportation option for essential purposes.” The company said it is trying to alter where its scooters are stationed to “align to essential travel needs including hospitals, transit stops, health clinics, and grocery stores.” Razor didn’t respond to a request for comment.",https://businessden.com/2020/03/30/bird-and-lime-pull-scooters-off-denver-streets/
"Some electric scooter companies roll out of town, for now",9 News,NBC,"Denver, CO",2020,3,31,"Some electric scooter companies roll out of town, for now. Lyft, Lime, Razor, Bird and Spin rethink their fleet presence in Denver amid COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to keep their riders healthy during the outbreak of COVID-19, scooter companies are temporarily rolling their scooter fleets out of town. With ongoing concerns surrounding the escalation of COVID-19, five scooter companies operating in Denver including Lyft, Lime, Razor, Bird and Spin, have all announced changes regarding their presence in Denver. The electric, two-wheeled scooters first arrived in the Mile High City in June of 2018, courtesy of Lime. Since then, their numbers and popularity have grown — that is, until the continued spread of COVID-19 caused enough concern about riders spreading germs on the scooters that the companies have changed their operations. Lime announced March 21 that it would “begin winding down and pausing service” in all of their markets, including Denver, but exempting South Korea. This action, according to Lime’s statement on their website, is to “help people stay put and stay safe.” Bird told 9NEWS through a statement that it will reduce its fleet size in the area to deter “non-critical mobility.” Bird also mentioned that their “...decision to reduce the fleet size is very fluid as the response to and recommendations regarding COVID-19 evolve.” Both Lime and Bird said their removals and reductions are temporary. Not all companies have pulled their scooter fleets. In statements to 9NEWS, both Razor and Lyft have confirmed that they are staying put in the Mile High City, at least for the time being. Razor said that it is maintaining its position in Denver as an essential activity in compliance with Gov. Jared Polis’ stay-at-home order. In an effort to help those who are in need of the public transportation provided by scooters, Razor said it will “...shift scooter deployment toward locations such as grocery stores, pharmacies and other ‘essential’ businesses that remain open under this stay-at-home directive.” Lyft said it's keeping the scooters to benefit those with essential travel needs an the company is striving to ease fears by increasing their cleaning protocol, as well as keeping their riders updated on CDC guidance. Lyft and Razor both added that they will monitor the situation closely and frequently. In a Medium update posted March 24, Spin said it will “continue operating in cities where we can make an impact and where the city is supporting our efforts to provide a transportation option for essential purposes,” which includes Denver.

After a one-month hiatus, Bird and Lime electronic scooters are back in Denver. Lime, which had removed all scooters in the Mile High City by the end of March, began returning them last Friday. Bird scooters also made a reappearance last week after the company announced on Friday that Denver was one of 10 markets where it planned to begin measured rollouts. “Amid the ongoing recovery from a global coronavirus pandemic that has rocked our understanding of everyday normalcy, one thing has become clear: a return to urban life choked by vehicle exhaust is becoming as unlikely as it is undesirable,” Bird said in a press release. “A growing list of cities, states and countries are looking to micromobility alternatives such as scooters and bikes not only as a means of minimizing congestion but also as a way to maintain current social distancing norms.” Of the five companies permitted to operate within the city, Bird and Lime were the only ones to remove their scooters from the city’s streets entirely as the coronavirus pandemic gathered strength.

Denver Prepares to Sign Scooter and E-Bike Companies to a Long-Term License,5280,,"Denver, CO",2020,6,1,"Denver Prepares to Sign Scooter and E-Bike Companies to a Long-Term License. Will the city's plan leave low-income riders behind? Despite all the fist-shaking when electric scooters appeared on Denver’s streets in 2018, the city’s decision to let the vehicles stay led to a startling revelation: We use them. An average of 4,832 rides take place each day, according to a 2019 Department of Transportation & Infrastructure’s survey. Won over by the high usage, officials will integrate scooters into Denver’s public transportation plan this summer by signing at least one operator to a long-term license, forcing the others to, well, scoot. The move will allow DPW to more closely regulate the two-wheelers by holding the companies responsible for, say, blocked sidewalks. Advocacy groups like the Denver Streets Partnership also hope chosen operators, along with the city, will subsidize rides for low-income residents—though DPW has made this a recommendation, not a requirement. Still, micromobility fans such as Bicycle Colorado are “really optimistic,” says spokesman Jack Todd.

Bird scooters flying around town,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2017,9,26,"Bird scooters flying around town. To travel “as the crow flies” means taking a direct route free of obstacles and the new Santa Monica company Bird wants to bring that ease of travel to street level with a fleet of rentable electric scooters. The company launched in September and Founder Travis VanderZanden said he moved his family to Santa Monica to start the company because it is an ideal location to launch a transit company. “We do think Santa Monica is a great city, I live here now, we’re headquarted here, we think it’s a great place to experiment with new innovative environmentally friendly transportation,” he said. “We know the city has parking and traffic problems like the rest of LA. We feel like it’s a great city for all of those reasons and we feel Bird can have a big impact on traffic and parking.” The company’s model is similar to a bikeshare or carshare program. Scooters are dispersed throughout Downtown and users can reserve/unlock one using a smartphone app. Each ride costs $1 plus 15 cents per minute. At the conclusion of a ride, the user can leave the scooter at their destination and lock the scooter using the app. Accounts are prepaid using a credit card. VanderZanden avoids calling his “Birds” scooters due to the connection to a children’s toy. He prefers to describe them as short-range electric vehicles and he recommends riders treat them as they would a bicycle, riding in the protected bike lanes when available and obeying any rules that would apply to a bicycle. The Birds have a range of about 15 miles and depending on the weight of the user, can travel at up to 15 mph. He said the response to the initial rollout has been overwhelmingly positive and despite the Bird’s relatively small size, theft hasn’t been problem. Each scooter has a GPS unit and is connected to the internet so the company can track any Bird that is potentially stolen. An electric lock restricts wheel movement and triggers an alarm if it is moved without being unlocked. If the electronics are tampered with, the Bird loses power and the wheel locks engage rendering it useless. VanderZanden said the he sees Bird coexisting with systems like Santa Monica’s Breeze bikes or the Zipcar model because his vehicles meet a slightly different need such as someone that wants to travel a small distance without incurring the physical exercise of a bike. “The transportation space is large and complex and we’re all looking for solutions to the transportation problems,” he said. The system currently runs afoul of the city’s rules regarding use of the public right of way but the company is hoping to work with officials to allow its scooters to be left on sidewalks. Francie Stefan, Santa Monica’s Mobility Manager said the transportation ecosystem should be as diverse as the biological ecosystem and the dominance of cars is like overplanting a single species. “The most healthy way is to offer a diversity of options that coexist for the long term,” she said. “That provide options for needs today and provide flexibility for when needs change.” Stefan said a 2016 study of transit use by Santa Monica residents showed 53 percent of trips were less than three miles and 18 percent were less than one mile. While walking is a readily available option for the shortest trips, she said there are other kinds of trips that could utilize some kind of short range vehicle. “We’re always looking for other systems that would meet enough user needs to be necessary to add to the diversity of transportation options,” she said. VanderZanden is a former Uber employee and said he has always had a passion for transit going back to his mother’s job as a bus driver. For him, the Birds are a tool for reducing congestion and while there’s nothing to stop tourists from taking them on a joyride, he said the vast majority of usage so far has been by locals making short-range commutes. “Our goal as a company is to help move people around cities with last mile transportation,” he said. “We think it’s the most efficient way to do it and reduce traffic and parking problems.” For more information, visit birdapp.com.

Bird Scooters Flocking to Venice,Yo! Venice,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,2,"Bird Scooters Flocking to Venice. “Cheap”, “ample” and “zippy”: these are some of the ways riders of Bird Scooters in Venice described the motorized scooters that have become an everyday sight on the Westside. Bird Inc, the company that operates these scooters, is based in Santa Monica, but users are allowed to ride outside the city. Venice, which can be reached easily via the beach bike path, is one of the more popular destinations for riders. Scooters cost $1 to unlock through the Bird app and then 15 cents per minute for the duration of the ride. Upon a ride’s completion, the scooters lock automatically and can be left anywhere. “They offer you a very fast and fun way of getting around. In my opinion Bird scooters are much better than the city bikes because the city bikes are very slow and if you want to park them you have to find a booth,” said one local 15-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous. While this description highlights the positive side of these scooters, it also highlights some of the negative consequences they have created. Johnny Parco, owner of Boardwalk Skate & Surf, is worried that as these scooters make their way into Venice, they may take potential customers away from his bike and skate rental service. “I think they are affecting our business,” Parco said. “We have been in business for 25 years, and as we have seen with the Metro Bikes and the Hulu Bikes, all these things are impacting our business and we still got the high rent, insurance, taxes, and employees.” Also of concern to Parco and local officials are the number of underage individuals riding these scooters. California law requires anyone operating motorized scooters to have a valid driver’s license or instructional permit and to wear a helmet. State law also prohibits riders from abandoning motorized scooters on public property or in a way that impedes pedestrian traffic. “We provide helmets, they don’t provide helmets. They got kids that are renting them that are 12, 15, I don’t know how old. I mean if they have a credit card they can get it. So that is a big liability,” Parco said. Recently Bird sent out an email saying they would provide one free helmet per user. Yet most riders still operate the scooters without a helmet, and there remains no enforcement mechanism to make sure riders are of age. “I get around the age requirements by just checking the box saying that I’m 18 because really nobody even checks if you meet the age requirement,” the 15-year-old interviewed for this article said. “If they did check, they would most likely lose a lot of their customers who ride Birds because a majority of Bird riders are under the age requirement.” Yo! Venice reached out to Bird Inc for comment, but they did not respond. In response to these issues, the Santa Monica City Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit against Bird Inc. The charges include operating without a business license, having scooters left in the public right of way, and refusal to comply with City citations. On December 7th, 2017, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Tamara Hall found reasonable ground that the company had committed the offenses listed in the complaint, and issued a summons to Bird Inc, that required them to appear in court to answer the charges on February 1, 2018. “Criminal prosecution is not the first remedy to be used in regulatory cases, but Bird’s flagrant violations of City laws threaten public safety and require prosecution,” said Santa Monica Deputy City Attorney Eda Suh in a press release. Frank Mateljan, Deputy Director of Community Engagement and Outreach for the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office told Yo! Venice that there is currently no legal action being pursued by the L.A. City, despite the fact that Bird Inc is operating without a business license. Johnny Parco, the owner of Boardwalk Surf & Skate, says that even if the City forces Bird to get a business license, the issue of these scooters being left on the sidewalk will remain. “Even if they do get a business license they are not allowed to be on City property, just like I am not allowed to be conducting a business on City property,” Parco said. Regardless of how these legal questions are settled, riders are encouraged to follow local rules and regulations which require wearing a helmet and having a valid driver’s license or permit. Riders can get a free helmet by logging into the Bird app and selecting Safety from the side menu.",https://yovenice.com/2018/02/02/bird-scooters-venice/
"Column: The Bird electric scooter conundrum: So fun, so exhilarating, so dangerous",Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,6,"Column: The Bird electric scooter conundrum: So fun, so exhilarating, so dangerous. The Birds landed in September. Since then, the lightweight matte black electric scooters have become as ubiquitous on the streets of Santa Monica and Venice as skateboards and bicycles. Each morning, as if by magic, hundreds of them materialize between 5 and 6. I have seen Birds perched on sidewalks, in alleys, in front of restaurants, on the Venice canals, at the Santa Monica Pier. They have been spotted as far away as LAX and West Hollywood. Each evening after dark, they are scooped up, taken away to be recharged. Depending on your point of view, the Bird fleet is an environmentally sound, inexpensive way to go “the last mile” between public transit and your destination, an annoying impediment to pedestrians who have to dodge them on sidewalks, a safety nightmare, a tantalizing toy for teenagers too young to legally rent them, a crime against the people of the state of California as laid out in a criminal complaint by Santa Monica against Bird Rides Inc. …or just a hell of a lot of fun. Last week, I opened the Bird app and located a scooter on 30th Place, an alley around the corner from my house in Venice. It was parked at someone’s back gate. While I unlocked the scooter, I spied a young woman walking toward me. As soon as she saw me with the scooter, she turned and walked away. Ha, I thought, beat ya to it! I pushed off, thumbed down the throttle and whooshed away. After a few exhilarating minutes, I circled back, then left the Bird in front of my fence a block from where I’d picked it up. When I looked out my front window 10 minutes later, the Bird was gone, unlocked by a new unknown rider destined for who-knows-where. The experience was delightfully transgressive — no reservations, no red tape, nobody telling me where I could leave the thing once I was done. All I had to do was agree to follow the rules (be over 18, have a driver’s license, wear a helmet, stay off the sidewalk). And of course, have a valid credit card. For $1, plus 15 cents per minute, I could go as far as the electric charge would take me, up to 15 miles, at a top speed of 15 mph. “I’d never ridden a scooter before this,” said Isaac Galan, 20, a Santa Monica College student and avid skateboarder who works at the Cow’s End coffee shop near the Venice Pier. “I’ll go maybe a mile at a time, maybe once a week, if I don’t feel like skating or walking.” Even though Birds are meant to be ridden in bike lanes on city streets, Galan said, he does not feel safe on one anywhere but the beach bike path. “I’ve seen a lot of people going 15 mph, and then hit something because they didn’t realize how close they were. It’s not a problem with the Bird scooter. It’s more a problem with people’s depth perception and misunderstanding their speed.” Santa Monica police have watched with some alarm, particularly after a helmet-less adult rider was seriously injured last month when she blew through a stop near Sixth and Idaho and crashed into a car. “In the last couple of weeks, our motor officers have been issuing citations,” said Santa Monica Police Department spokesman Lt. Saul Rodriguez. Sometimes, he said, officers will warn a rider to use a helmet or tell them to get off the sidewalk into the bike lane where they belong. An even bigger problem, though, is the number of underaged riders. You can stand on the boardwalk between the Venice and Santa Monica piers any day of the week and watch kids who look way younger than 18 on the scooters. They don’t wear helmets and they often ride double on the narrow plank meant for two feet, not four. Santa Monica police sometimes issue citations. “Sometimes we call Mom and Dad,” Rodriguez said. A Bird spokesman said the company has changed its policy and will soon be requiring users to show their driver’s license when they create accounts. Travis VanderZanden, 38, a father of two young children who moved from the Bay Area to Santa Monica to start Bird Rides Inc., said he has confiscated scooters from underaged riders. “We have disabled plenty of accounts,” he said. “Bird does not want underage riders,” he said. “I have talked to parents who are letting kids ride, and I have personally disabled their accounts on the spot.” He also has the ability to identify individual scooters and disable them, too, if he sees they are being misused. Bird, which rolled out in San Diego two weeks ago and has plans to go national and international, according to its jobs listings, has begun giving out free helmets to its users. They can be ordered from the “safety” tab in the app. So far, it has delivered 2,500 helmets. I ordered one Monday, although I am a rebel at heart and did not use one on my first two rides. (Don’t disable me, bro!) :: Santa Monica, which has embraced bike hubs and reducing dependence on single-occupancy cars, has welcomed Bird to town. Sort of. “It’s fun to be on a scooter and we completely understand the appeal,” said Santa Monica public information officer Constance Farrell. “But we also understand they are dangerous, and not toys, and need to be operated safely.” Late last year, Santa Monica city officials grew so frustrated with Bird’s refusal to work out some licensing issues that the city attorney filed an eight-count misdemeanor criminal complaint naming the company and VanderZanden as defendants. The complaint alleges that Bird violated requirements for business licenses and vendor permits and failed to pay administrative fines. Bird says vendor permits apply to food trucks, not scooters. “Multiple attempts were made and they were unwilling to come to the table to work with us,” Farrell said. “That’s why the criminal complaint was filed.” That is a rather intense way to get a company’s attention, I suggested. Farrell did not disagree. “Bird Rides Inc. has a business license to operate a brick-and-mortar administrative office,” she said, “but they do not have the appropriate license to operate scooters in an ad hoc manner on the public right of way.” Santa Monica is eager to disrupt dependence on cars, Farrell said, but right now Bird is in the doghouse. “This is a rogue implementation model that does not have an eye toward safety.” The city, somewhat mollified by Bird’s free helmet program, is especially concerned about scooters being left on sidewalks, obstructing pedestrians and wheelchairs. VanderZanden disputes her description: “It’s not rogue. We are working closely with the city and feel we have had some productive conversations.” VanderZanden has experience with tech companies whose boundary pushing results in litigation. He is a former chief operating officer and early angel investor at Lyft whose defection to Uber in 2014 resulted in an ugly lawsuit that was settled confidentially in 2016. On Feb. 1, a judge delayed a hearing in the criminal case to Feb. 24 to allow the parties time to negotiate. I foresee an amicable resolution. I also foresee more accidents. And, of course, the inevitable lawsuit or two.",https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-bird-scooters-20180206-story.html
Bird lovers tweet as tickets ruffle feathers,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,7,"Bird lovers tweet as tickets ruffle feathers. After flying free for more nearly five months, Bird riders are getting their wings clipped. The Santa Monica Police Department has officially started cracking down on the city’s 30,000 Bird subscribers, issuing traffic tickets to unsuspecting tourists and locals alike. Last week alone cops stopped 196 people riding motorized scooters throughout the city, issuing a whopping 92 tickets for various traffic violations including failure to wear a helmet, according to Lt. Saul Rodriguez with the SMPD. “They are issuing citations more aggressively,” Rodriguez said. “We’ve done some education. We are still issuing some warnings.” Users immediately started squawking. “@santamonicacity just gave me a $190 ticket for riding a @_birdapp scooter without a helmet,” tweeted local software engineer and entrepreneur Scot Lawrie Friday. “that’s the last time I spend any time/money in Santa Monica (except when they force me to go to court – I’m not allowed to just pay it online)” Since the underground launch in September, Bird scooters have become a pervasive feature of Santa Monica life, zipping across downtown, up Main Street and through neighborhoods. Local fans, both on social media and in person, have complained laws requiring a helmet to ride a motorized scooter are outdated, since the Birds are limited to 15 miles per hour. “It’s State law, not a local one,” City Manager Rick Cole recently tweeted. “And explain to the rider who went to the hospital in serious condition with a head injury two weeks ago that she wouldn’t have been better off with a helmet.” Santa Monica’s top official was referring to a Jan. 10 incident when a Bird rider flew into a moving car at the corner of 6th and Idaho. The scooter rider had blown through a stop sign when she hit the car, which had the right-of-way, according to the SMPD. The California Vehicle Code defines a motorized scooter as a two-wheeled device with handlebars and a floorboard designed to be stood upon while riding and is powered by an electric motor. Their use requires a Class C License and a bicycle helmet. City officials are attempting to reign in the unfettered flock of flightless Birds in two ways: by ticketing users and by suing the company for operating without the proper permits. Other rental companies like Segways and bike shops have permits for every location they do business: including drop off points. Since Bird has an ad-hoc network where users can simply dump the scooters wherever they please, the city argues they are improperly operating in the public right of way. Earlier this year, City Hall filed a criminal complaint against Bird but CEO Travis VanderZanden argued the rules are too vague to govern a new kind of business. In response, the Bird app suddenly got a new feature – a button where users could email city leaders in support of the service. Within days the emails descended on City Hall like Alfred Hitchcock’s birds – as nearly a thousand flooded official inboxes. In the meantime, locals and continue to use the scooters at their own risk of receiving a hefty fine. The ticket for riding without a helmet, riding on the sidewalk, leaving a scooter in the right-of-way or riding without a license is $190. Riding under the influence of drugs or alcohol results in a $352 fine.",https://www.smdp.com/bird-lovers-tweet-as-tickets-ruffle-feathers/164289
Could These Little Scooters Be the Future of People Moving?,LA Magazine,Hour Media Group,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,7,"Could These Little Scooters Be the Future of People Moving? Just east of the shop-lined streets of Old Pasadena on Colorado Boulevard, a narrow storefront resonates with whirring drills and clinking metal as a small group of men work on a factory line. It’s not a scene you’d expect in the retail district, but the electric scooters they’re building aren’t typical either. An upside-down metal V with two teeny wheels, the Urb-E is foldable and light enough to carry. Which is why the scooter is being marketed as one way to address what transportation folks call the “first/last mile” problem: how to get people to and from Metro stops and stations. In fact, along with the Hoverboard, it’s one of only two “rideables” (i.e. super-portable electric vehicles) Metro and Metrolink allow on buses and trains. Grant Delgatty conceived of the Urb-E in 2012. Forty-seven years old with close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair, he has designed everything from furniture to footwear. Making things move has always been his real passion, though—bring up motors, wheels, or speed, and his stoic demeanor quickly evaporates. “I love anything vehicle-related. In fact, my two sons are named Dezin—kind of like ‘design’—and Racin,” he says with a grin. Delgatty was teaching courses on mobility at ArtCenter College of Design when he took a crack at making a scooter in his Pasadena garage. He cut weight-reducing holes in the frame, a technique he borrowed from airplane design. The local aerospace industry was also one reason Delgatty kept production local. “There are very precision-based manufacturing capabilities here in L.A.,” he says. Delgatty has packed a lot into a little package. The Pro GT model can haul more than 300 pounds, travel about 20 miles on a single charge, and hit speeds of 18 mph—though steep inclines are still a challenge. Scooters that aren’t shipped to customers go to the company’s nearby store on Green Street and a new one at USC Village. Ranging in price from $899 to $1,999, Urb-E is probably too costly for many county public transportation users, 71 percent of whom make less than $25,000 a year. But Metro has looked into workarounds—in 2016 the nonprofit Coro studied rideables for the agency. “If we’re serious about first/last mile [solutions], we want to make sure they’re accessible,” says Julia Gould, a former Coro fellow. Among other ideas, her team pitched a rideable rental program akin to Metro Bike Share. Delgatty is already exploring technology that would allow people to unlock scooters via smartphone. But a public share system would require a lot more money, infrastructure, and planning (the company Bird Rides, which began renting out more traditional motorized scooters last year, ran into legal issues in Santa Monica for operating without authorization). For now, Urb-E could just benefit from more exposure. As Delgatty prepares to leave the factory on his Urb-E, three construction workers stop to ask what he’s riding. After a quick sales pitch, Delgatty chuckles, climbing back onto the scooter. “That’s actually one of the main complaints of owners,” he says. “They bought the Urb-E to save time, but they end up getting stopped a lot.”",https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/urb-e-scooter-pasadena/
Bird electric scooters are now all over the Westside,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,14,"Bird electric scooters are now all over the Westside. They’re pretty cheap and easy to ride—but they’ve run afoul of city officials. Sunday afternoons on the Venice boardwalk are chaotic, with neighbors, artists, Angelenos, and tourists talking, trading, and traveling up and down the beachfront. Bikes, skateboards, and Segways continuously stream by on the winding two-lane path. Recently, a different vehicle has dominated the road. This past Sunday, anybody planted in a beach chair, looking back towards the boardwalk, would have seen a parade of Bird scooters roll by, accompanied by the faint hum of electric motors. Since the Santa Monica-based company began operating on September 1, placing hundreds of scooters on the city’s sidewalks, Bird has quickly become ubiquitous in Venice and Santa Monica. But the startup’s rapid growth and dockless technology has already set the small scooters on a collision course with local regulators. In December, the city of Santa Monica filed a criminal case against the company, accusing it of operating without proper permits and owing more than $6,000 in fines. On Wednesday, it agreed to pay more than $300,000 as part of a settlement with the city; it also agreed to “run a weeklong public safety education campaign on the Big Blue Bus.” “Santa Monica is a multi-modal city focused on carbon reduction,” city spokersperson Constance Farrell says. “We’re supportive of... the concept of Bird. They just need to operate lawfully and safely.” Bird claims the Chinese-made electric scooters are an innovative, convenient, and more sustainable solution to last-mile travel. Being easy-to-operate scooters, they’re pretty fun to ride. “Our mission is to get people out of cars,” says spokesperson Marcus Reese. The company would not provide an accounting of the number of Bird’s on the road, though estimates suggest its more than 1,000 scooters. But early reactions from riders suggest its catching on. Their slim profiles stream up and down the retail and restaurant corridors of Abbot-Kinney and Rose Avenue, circle the tech offices of Silicon Beach, and dart throughout downtown Santa Monica. Sidewalks and side streets are filled with the scooters, since the dockless vehicles, locked and unlocked with an app, can be dropped off and picked up anywhere. Bird now claims more than 40,000 active users and has started expanding, with small trials in Brentwood and on the UCLA campus as well as Pacific Beach in San Diego. On Tuesday, it announced $15 million in additional funding, suggesting its plans for expansion to other cities are on track. While small in stature, the scooters seemed poised to follow the path of the big ride-sharing companies, growing as fast as they can, and letting regulations and precedent play catch up. In the last few weeks, Santa Monica police have started being more aggressive, ticketing riders who scoot by on sidewalks instead of streets and bike lanes, or those without helmets. Farrell says the company only had a license to operate a brick-and-mortar location when it first started placing scooters out in September. Some early riders, especially those younger than 18, were violating state safety laws. Upon a referral from the City’s Code Enforcement Division, prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Bird on December 6 for operating a commercial scooter rental business on the public right of way without a proper business license and failing to comply with administrative citations. The city has since worked with the company to institute measures to improve performance and safety, and deal with right-of-way issues when users ride them on the sidewalks, leading up to today’s announcement that Bird agreed to pay $6,115.63 in previously issued citations, pay additional fines and investigative costs totaling $300,000, and run a week-long safety campaign on the city’s Big Blue Bus. Over the weekend, only a handful of the dozens of Bird riders spotted on the streets and sidewalks of Venice and Santa Monica wore helmets. A plane pulling a banner with the Bird logo that read “Ride Safely” circled around the beach. Most users, while cruising the beach in a perfectly safe and orderly fashion, either didn’t notice it or ignored it. Bird founder Travis VanderZanden, who has spent years with tech and transportation companies as both the first COO of Lyft and as VP of driver growth for Uber, has taken the dockless biking model and, in the parlance of tech, “removed friction.” Rides are quick and easy, with little to no physical effort involved. They’re relatively cheap, at $1 per ride, plus 15 cents per minute, and while they may not be fast enough or convenient enough for a daily commute (they max out at 15 miles per hour), the ubiquity and ease of use make it incredibly easy to use for a quick errand or trip. The prices compares favorably to single rides on existing bike-share systems, such as Breeze Bikes ($3.50 for 30 minutes) or Metro Bikes ($3.50 for each trip of 30 minutes or under and then $3.50 per additional 30 minutes), though both bike systems have membership plans that make the per-ride cost more affordable. Perhaps the most interesting innovation may be how they’re powered every night. In addition to employing teams to pick up and charge the scooters every night (which have a max 15-mile range), users can sign up to charge them at home, and get paid in cash and credit ($5 per scooter). Bird has created a quick, easy to administer, decentralized, electric transit option. Having used the scooters on-and-off for the last month, I would say it’s easy to find one when you need it. The company has also been aggressive when it comes to expansion. The Washington Post revealed that VanderZanden initially contacted Santa Monica Mayor Ted Winterer via LinkedIn after putting Bird’s on the road. The mayor, and different members of the Santa Monica government, have complained about Birds, including rider citations and eight related accidents that required responses from the fire department. One woman seriously injured her head earlier this year, according to Farrell, and the city is concerned about people seeing them as toys as opposed to vehicles that share the road with cars. Bird claims to be a better partner than other tech companies in the transit space. In addition to paying fines, in response to the safety concerns raised by the city, the app now requires users to scan their driver’s licenses (to verify that they are 18 or older). The sign-up and log-in processes repeatedly tell users to wear helmets and to leave the scooters in convenient places that don’t block pedestrians. Users can also request a helmet, which Bird will mail to them for free (they’ve sent out thousands, says Reese). The company and the city plan to discuss “the best regulatory regime going forward,” says Reese. “We feel we were legally licensed from the beginning, and oftentimes technology moves faster than government, and when new things are introduced, there isn’t an appropriate regulatory regime. We’re glad to be a partner with the city to figure it out.” “Santa Monica would like nothing more than to have this type of transportation integrated into its other options,” Farrell says. “A robust transportation infrastructure is better for everyone.” Reese wouldn’t comment on any new expansion plans for the company. But with the $15 million recently raised from venture capital firms such as Craft Ventures, Tusk Ventures, Valor, Lead Edge Capital, and Goldcrest Capital, it’s quickly becoming a leader in a space poised to crowd streets and sidewalks across the country. Both Spin and LimeBike, two dockless bike startups, have announced plans to add the service. Reese says the company plans to expand safely: “One rider without a helmet is one rider too many.” And, anyways, he says, the real danger is the cars on the road.",https://la.curbed.com/2018/2/14/17010034/bird-electric-scooters-transit-venice-santa-monica
L.A. scooter startup Bird gets wings clipped with legal settlement,LA Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,16,"L.A. scooter startup Bird gets wings clipped with legal settlement. Silicon Beach startup Bird recently raised $15 million to expand its fleet of shared electric scooters. Some $300,000 of that will now go to the city of Santa Monica. The company has settled a legal spat with the beach city over allegations that Bird failed to secure a business license and did not comply with administrative citations. Under the plea, the startup will secure the necessary paperwork and pay more than $300,000 in fines as well as run a weeklong public safety campaign through the local bus system. Bird landed in Santa Monica in September, and since then, users have logged more than 250,000 rides on the environmentally friendly electric scooters. Rides cost $1 plus 15 cents per mile. Riders must have a driver’s license and wear a helmet. The scooters cannot be operated on sidewalks or the beach bike path, and they can carry only one rider at a time. Since its debut, Bird also has reduced the top speed of its scooters from 22 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour, has started providing a free helmet service, has put key safety rules on its vehicles and its app, and has improved app security to make sure that only those with a valid driver’s license can rent a scooter. “With this agreement, Bird and [CEO Travis] VanderZanden acknowledge that they failed to comply with the City of Santa Monica’s business licensing requirements, which are designed to protect the safety of the public,” said Deputy City Attorney Eda Suh in a statement. “Bringing this new business into compliance with local law achieves a fair and positive outcome for the people of Santa Monica.” ""We are pleased that Bird and the city of Santa Monica were able to work out our differences regarding licensure,"" added a Bird spokesperson to the Los Angeles Times. ""Bird now starts fresh with the city, and we look forward to continuing to provide a safe, environmentally friendly transportation solution to the people of Santa Monica."" Prior to founding Bird, VanderZanden served as COO at Lyft and as vice president of global driver growth at Uber, though not without sparking a lawsuit alleging he stole company secrets and broke confidentiality when he joined Lyft’s rival. VanderZanden denied the charges, and the companies eventually settled out of court.",https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2018/02/16/l-a-scooter-startup-bird-gets-wings-clipped-with.html
Op-Ed: Can the Bird electric scooter solve our transit woes?,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,2,27,"Op-Ed: Can the Bird electric scooter solve our transit woes? On the Santa Monica and Venice Beach oceanfront, alternative modes of transportation are nothing new. This is where the Dogtown skateboarders ruled in the 1970s, where Jimmy Buffet saw a man rollerskating naked through a crosswalk in the 1980s, where Rollerbladers led the inline trend of the 1990s, and where I’ve seen unicycles, bicycles, tricycles, pedicabs, Segways, ElliptiGOs, horses, dog sleds on wheels, and a shopping cart modified by a homeless man into a motorized conveyance. Everyone has to make do with urban infrastructure designed for cars, if they venture onto the streets, or pedestrians, if they keep to the sidewalks. So do riders trying the newest craze on the Westside: Bird, the slim, stand-up electric scooter that maxes out at 15 mph. It’s an alternative to a long walk, a bike ride or a short drive to an area without parking. Unlocking one requires a smart phone, a credit card and a driver’s license. As with bike-share programs, users pay to rent them –– $1 per ride plus 15 cents per minute. But at the end of the ride there’s no need to find a docking station. Like cars, Birds can be left at one’s destination, even an out-of-the-way shop or a house in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Travis VanderZanden, a former Uber and Lyft executive, raised $15 million in backing for Bird, suggesting he’s not the only one convinced it can gain followers in Southern California and beyond. But many regard Birds as an invasive species, and they are registering their complaints on neighborhood forums like Nextdoor as well as in bars and coffee shops. Bird riders, they complain, are breaking the formal rules that helped persuade Santa Monica to allow the new technology. Riders are supposed to wear helmets and stick to the streets while avoiding sidewalks. Many do neither. The dearth of fixed docking stations means Birds are often left blocking a sidewalk or leaned against a shop window. And they’re too quiet — a pedestrian can’t even hear one coming. All of those critiques are fair. And figuring out where exactly Birds fit next to cars, bikes and people, if they fit at all, is bound to involve trial and error, as well as an unknown number of injuries to riders and bystanders. Cyclists, who fought long and hard for a tiny strip on the margins of our roads, can be forgiven for not wanting to share their paths. But the Westside’s streets are gridlocked for hours twice a day, everyday; cycling is often lethal; and excepting main commercial strips and touristy stretches, most of the area’s sidewalks are utterly empty. That status quo isn’t worth preserving, is it? Bird can only disrupt our streetscape insofar as it is popular. But if it grows in popularity, it could make Westside residents and visitors less reliant on Uber, Lyft and personal vehicles, reducing congestion, freeing up parking spots and decreasing emissions. It might be especially useful in taking people the “last mile” home after getting off a bus or train. Maria Konnikova once pointed out that “precedence-based reasoning is everywhere in life. ... We think we should earn more than a new hire; we believe that seniority in a group should be respected, and get mad when our status is usurped by an upstart. So it goes when it comes to the feeling of owning the road: precedence comes first.” At bottom, the case against Bird is that other methods of transportation got there first, and electric scooters fit uneasily into the system built for them. Progress requires us to welcome newcomers and the dynamism they inject into our cities. Just as Uber and bike shares inspired Bird, allowing Bird to operate will inspire new innovations and variations on getting from here to there –– and those innovations will inspire us to rethink how our streets and sidewalks ought to be used, rather than concluding that today’s gridlocked Los Angeles is as good as it gets.

Update: Electric scooters: Part of the transportation solution or public nuisance? Partly Both,High School Insider,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,3,3,"Update: Electric scooters: Part of the transportation solution or public nuisance? Partly Both. Bird scooters may be perceived as a public nuisance, but as a company they are working to change that perception. Bird recently came to an agreement with the city of Santa Monica regarding safety and compliance with city regulations. According to the Santa Monica city website, on February 14, Santa Monica City Attorney’s Office prosecutors entered a plea agreement with Bird Rides, Inc. and Travis VanderZanden (collectively “Bird”), whereby Bird will accept responsibility for violating local law and pay significant penalties. As part of the plea agreement, Bird agreed to: Secure proper city business licenses and work with the city’s Business License Division to ensure compliance with local business licensing regulations. Pay previously issued Administrative Citation fines totaling $6,115.63. Pay additional fines and investigative costs totaling $300,000. Run a weeklong public safety education campaign on the Big Blue Bus. Accept responsibility for Bird’s prior conduct, plead “No Contest” to an infraction and pay additional criminal fines of $200 plus statutory penalty assessments. These are all positive steps, but the reality remains that many people will continue to ride birds without helmets. Birds provide a convenient way to move just a few blocks when you may have been planning to walk. Pedestrians don’t always have helmets with them, so this will be an obstacle Bird will have to overcome. The Santa Monica Police Department has begun an active campaign of stopping riders and informing them they are breaking the law. One junior at Santa Monica High School was stopped by police when riding a bird just a few blocks without a helmet. The fine for riding without a helmet is $190. He was not cited, but he was warned. Bird scooters are a convenient transportation option for students, particularly if they only need to go a short distance. They don’t have to own anything, they don’t have to pay for parking, and they don’t have to return anything to a specific location. Although 18 is the official age for ridership, that doesn’t stop younger teens from riding. Adults on social media have expressed frustration at kids not following safety rules and the random abandonment of Birds along the sidewalks, frequently referred to as “littering.” There’s not much Bird can do about that as a company. Bird has made an effort on their website to stress safety, helmet usage, and appropriate parking etiquette. Additionally, Bird has lowered the maximum speed of its scooters to 15 mph from 22 mph in order to make them safer. It seems that Bird scooters are here to stay. They are fun, convenient methods of transportation. Hopefully they will remain safe as well.

Electric scooter rental apps are a new trend — but many see a road hazard,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,3,7,"Electric scooter rental apps are a new trend — but many see a road hazard. As Southern California continues to embrace “dockless” bike sharing, a new player in the app-based mobility market has picked up considerable momentum — electric scooters. These motorized scooters have created a challenge for local authorities as riders of all ages from beach communities to urban centers have in recent weeks and months been riding illegally on sidewalks and without helmets. Like dockless rental bikes, users can unlock the scooters using a smartphone and then drop them anywhere. The business comes in contrast to the docked model, where users must pick up and return bikes to a fixed station. Most recently, the city of San Diego seems to have been caught flatfooted enforcing state laws on the increasingly popular motorized scooters. Santa Monica has also been grappling with the proliferation of the scooters in recent months. While the police department has said it’s cracking down on such illegal behavior, riders from downtown to Pacific Beach can be found on any given day careening on and off busy sidewalks, often without helmets. Riding in traffic can feel “unsafe,” said Tony Cai, 23, who was running errands on an electric scooter in downtown San Diego on Monday. “It depends on if there’s a designated bike lane. If it’s not really clear, I’d rather ride a little bit slower on the sidewalks.” While the city has plans to dramatically expand bike lanes in downtown, the vision has yet to be realized. Residents have now started to express frustration at the potentially dangerous situation as motorized scooters join the thousands of freestanding rental bikes strewn about the city. “I’m a fan of the bicycles, but these people on the scooters are an accident waiting to happen,” said Dave Gapp, 62, who said he and his wife almost crashed into three people zipping down the sidewalk on scooters in front of Petco Park. “We were afraid we were going to be hit,” he added. “If a 200-pound person going even 10 MPH runs into someone, that’s going to cause considerable damage.” In response to questions about public safety, Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s office provided few details on what if anything the city plans to do to address the situation. “People should follow the laws and take appropriate safety precautions,” Greg Block, senior press secretary for Faulconer, said in an email. The Santa Monica-based company Bird pioneered the electric scooter business model in Southern California, launching in September to much fanfare and quickly expanding to Venice and now San Diego. Bay Area startup LimeBike took notice and recently launched its own electric scooter option, currently available only in San Diego. “We’ve been blown away by the number of rides we’ve gotten in the first few weeks,” Zack Bartlett, general manager in San Diego for LimeBike, said of the electric scooters. However, Bird has had something of a bumpy start, with the city of Santa Monica cracking down on the local startup last month following a number of accidents, including a severe head injury and a broken arm. After the city sued Bird for operating without a business license, the company agreed to pay $300,000 in fines and other fees, as well as roll out a public safety campaign. As a result, the company also reduced the speed of its scooters from 22 to 15 MPH and started giving away free helmets to consumers that request one through the app, which now takes users through the rules of the road upon installation. “Ideally we want to educate people,” said Kenneth Baer, spokesperson for Bird. “But we can’t monitor everything people do once they get a Bird.” To that end, the Santa Monica police department started aggressively ticketing those riding on the sidewalk, said city spokeswoman Constance Farrell. “We’ve seen a lot of behavior that’s very unsafe, and so they are in fact enforcing rules through citations,” she said. “Our biggest concern is that a lot of young people, children, preteens, see these as toys.” The San Diego Police Department said it has been enforcing the laws around motorized scooters but would not provide statistics on the number of citations it’s issued in the last year to people illegally riding bicycles or scooters on the side walk. “We are aware of the safety issues they are causing and have been enforcing the laws related to these,” police spokesman Billy Hernandez said in an email. In Pacific Beach — where Bird first launched in San Diego — tensions over the electric scooters have been running high. “I live in Pacific Beach and they’re everywhere running red lights,” said Hayden Noel, 58, who drives for Lyft. “The police aren’t ticketing anyone. “They’re such a nuisance,” he added. “I’m assuming there’s going to be a fatality in the next 10 days.” While numerous people could be seen riding the scooters up and down Garnet Avenue this week, Sara Berns, executive director at Discover Pacific Beach, said that police officers have recently started citing people for riding on the sidewalk. “I think partly people don’t know the rules,” she said. “We hear all the time that people don’t know they’re not allowed to be on the sidewalk.” Electric scooter and dockless bike sharing companies typically carry liability insurance and often have contracts that indemnify local governments from legal responsibility in case of accidents.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-scooters-20180307-story.html
Bird Scooters Have Invaded L.A.’s Westside,LA Magazine,Hour Media Group,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,3,20,"Bird Scooters Have Invaded L.A.’s Westside. If you’ve been anywhere in Westwood, Venice, or Santa Monica lately, you’ve likely seen—or been nearly run down by—a Bird scooter. The app-enabled, Santa Monica-based rental service launched in the fall and quickly became a hit with tech workers, savvy tourists, and UCLA and Santa Monica College students. As a Bird spokesperson says via email, “Demand for Bird is high and those who ride Birds love them, so we see a lot of opportunity for growth here.” What’s been unclear so far is whether the greater L.A. area is ready. As the public took notice of Bird—with over 50,000 people hopping on for a dollar a ride plus 15 cents a mile since the company’s launch—Santa Monica officials struggled to regulate the service, which allows users to drop off the scooters wherever they please, assuming the devices are not blocking driveways or endangering the public (the electric contraptions don’t move without an app code and are picked up by trucks every night by 8 p.m.). In early March, the city passed an emergency ordinance that allows it to impound any scooters abandoned in places that limit access or imperil safety. The city and the company are working on making peace—Bird even paid a $300,000 settlement in response to a lawsuit that accused the company of not obtaining the proper permits. Officially, the law dictates that Bird riders are supposed to wear helmets and ride in the street or bike lane. Bird offers free helmets to riders who don’t have them, but given the choice between braving traffic on Wilshire or risking getting a ticket for riding on the sidewalk, riders will tend to choose the latter. At least one collision between a scooter rider and car has been reported, and Santa Monica police are “aggressively” ticketing sidewalk riders to prevent collisions with pedestrians. Santa Monica does have incentive to make it work with Bird, as the city—and the region as a whole—tries to encourage more walking, biking, and transit use. The Birds are perfect solutions to the “first mile/last mile” problem, getting people from their homes to a bus or train stop, or from a bus or train stop to their final destinations. That issue of final connection has befuddled Metro, which has seen its ridership steadily decline during the last few years. Metro and other area transit providers have not found viable ways at moving people around short distances. The L.A. area is filled with different bike rental kiosks that are not compatible (UCLA, Santa Monica, and Metro all have different systems); most neighborhoods and train stations don’t have any options for renting a bike. Even parking a bike at Metro stations can be a challenge. Birds are currently available in Venice, UCLA, Westwood, Santa Monica, and San Diego, and the company plans to be in 50 markets by the end of the year, according to a spokesperson. Los Angeles officials will have to figure out if they’ll play nice when Bird inevitably pitches itself to City Hall. Just like Mayor Garcetti and LADOT head Seleta Reynolds, Bird founder Travis VanderZanden says he’d ultimately like to see fewer cars on the streets of L.A. “Preventing car ownership is the goal of all these [car and scooter rental] companies,” VanderZanden told TechCrunch. “I think if all of us are successful, that’s fine.”",https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/bird-scooter/
The new gig economy job? Charging electric scooters,Curbed Los Angeles,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,5,10,"The new gig economy job? Charging electric scooters. Chargers and mechanics for Bird scooters talk about these new roles: “The pay is pretty good if you hustle”. Mike Westell, 33, a bike mechanic and tattoo artist who lives in Santa Monica, started a new gig two weeks ago. He mostly repairs vehicles when he wants and where he finds them, occasionally bringing them into a friend’s garage for further work. Training was simple: sign up, take an online video course, receive a set of tools in the mail, then get to work. He even picks his own hours. “The pay is pretty good if you hustle,” he says. Westell represents a new type of independent contractor in the gig economy: a mechanic for Bird, one of a proliferating number of electric scooter start-ups trying to add a new option to the ever-crowded city transit landscape. As cities figure out how to react to and regulate this new transit option, the conversation often focuses on infrastructure. How can city streets and sidewalks accommodate a new form of transportation, and how can these scooters fit in without being a safety hazard and getting in the way of pedestrians? Competitors have scrambled to add scooters to new markets, and the big three companies—Bird, LimeBike, and Spin—have more than $200 million in venture capital funding and aggressive expansion plans. These companies arrived unexpectedly in Nashville and Charlotte over the last few days. But there’s another type of infrastructure that hasn’t been as closely examined, the workforce that charges and repairs these electric vehicles. Curbed spoke with four Californians in Los Angeles and the San Francisco areas who work for Bird Scooters, which launched in Santa Monica and Venice last fall. These workers, all independent contractors, represent a new facet of the gig economy, and all enjoy the job and the ability to make money with a flexible side hustle. Bird declined to comment and wouldn’t provide Curbed with any details about the number of employees who work in these roles, how much the company is spending on charging and repairs, or any other information about this aspect of their operations. ‘Do you like to make money while you sleep?’ Residents of Venice Beach have likely spotted Bird contractors working in their neighborhood. A pick-up will drive by, with a stack of Bird scooters packed in the truck bed. Or, a scooter rider may roll by with a rider balancing two or three additional out-of-commission scooters resting perpendicular on the scooter’s deck. These are the chargers, independent contractors who keep the electric scooters running by charging them at their homes or apartments (a competitor, LimeBike, calls them “Juicers”). One of the advantages of dockless scooter systems like Bird is decentralization; the vehicles have no fixed docks, and go where riders are. The contract workers who charge Birds do the same. Workers sign up online or via the Bird app (the website asks, “Do you like to make money while you sleep?”). After a phone interview to discuss the job, chargers are mailed a set of charger cords—three to start, according to chargers Curbed spoke with, and more as they prove reliable and develop a good track record. Harry Campbell, who runs a website about driving for Uber and Lyft, created a step-by-step guide to becoming a charger. The company caps the numbers of cords per charger at 20, and each requires a $10 deposit. Once they’re set up, chargers use the app to hunt down scooters, finding Birds low on energy, and bringing them home to power them up. Casey Dalton, 44, a part-time security guard who lives in Venice, has been charging for about four months out of a one-bedroom guest house he rents. On an average day, he can make about $110. Dalton says there’s friendly competition between the chargers in his neighborhood, who often run into each other as they scout the streets for scooters. His description of finding and charging scooters almost sounds like a game. “I’m hustling to get a scooter, and if there’s a guy already there, I usually recognize them” he says. “I’ve started doing sportsmanlike joshing. It’s good friendly competition, like playing pick-up basketball.” Chargers work around a routine set up by their schedule and Bird’s desire to have all its scooters off the streets at night. Every morning, scooters that have been charged overnight need to be released back onto the street into what’s called a nest, a predetermined corner or location on the map chargers can find via their app. Charged scooters need to be in a nest between 4 and 7 a.m., in groups of three with handlebars tilted to the right and kickstands down. Chargers need to snap a photo of the scooters when they release them and send to Bird to verify they’re set up correctly. Scooters need to be picked up by 8 p.m., and then the cycle continues the next day. Chargers can do multiple shifts during the day. On a recent Saturday afternoon in Venice, a charger, who had 15 or so Birds in his garage, was riding around the neighborhood, picking up depleted scooters. According to the workers interviewed, chargers get paid $5 to $20 per charged scooter, depending on how much power has been used and how difficult it is to find (they’re color-coded, green being the easiest to find, then yellow and red). The chargers Curbed spoke to said it’s a great part-time gig—most worked 5 to 6 hours at most every day—and a flexible way to earn extra money. They also said the repeated charging didn’t make a serious dent on their utility costs (the company says it costs 8 to 15 cents per Bird). One estimated that a particularly busy schedule would add between $5 and $10 a month to the electric bill. How Bird scooters get fixed Bird hasn’t released any statistics on the number of scooters they have on the streets in any of their active markets. Stray observations, and social media photos, suggest they get a decent amount of use, as well as wear and tear. To fix its fleet, Bird also employs a number of mechanics to repair and restore busted and broken scooters, who also use the app to hunt down broken scooters. They’re paid $5 to $20 a scooter, depending on the extent of the repair. According to Westell, mechanics are broken down into three categories, L1, L2, and L3. He’s an L1, and deals with basic repairs: he’ll fix flat tires, change inner tubes, loosen stuck throttles, and repair busted brake lines. Anything more serious gets passed on to different mechanics. “There are times when people beat the shit out of the scooters because they aren’t their property,” he says. “Birds are new, but I’m sure the company will get a lot more strict once they see their product being destroyed, and having to pay for it.” Big perks While some economists have claimed this system creates a “race to the bottom” and exploits contractors, every one of the Bird contractors said they loved the flexibility and the ability to earn extra money, and felt it was a good deal. Rochelle Randle, 26, a new mom who lives in Burlingame, California, about 13 miles from San Francisco, discovered Bird when she and her partner were looking for a new way to earn some extra money. She’s been charging for a month since the company came to San Francisco, waking up around 5 a.m. to head to south San Francisco and release scooters, and then doing one or two charging shifts during the day. She says she makes an average of about $500 a week working Monday through Friday, and still works just weeks after giving birth; her baby boy can tag along in a car seat when she’s out picking up and dropping off scooters. “It’s a really convenient thing, and really helpful to me to have the extra stability,” she says. “It’s on your own schedule, and they don’t set expectations.” The contractors also said the company was adapting and improving, adding more nests and continually updating the app. Dalton says he’s been called a few times by the company to talk about what he’s doing, and what does and doesn’t work. “If anything could hurt this situation, it would be overreaching regulations by local government,” says Dalton. “I don’t fear it, I think they’ve been through most of this stuff with Uber.”",https://la.curbed.com/2018/5/10/17336874/bird-electric-scooters-transit-charger-mechainc
Op-Ed: Bird scooters are ruining Venice,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,5,15,"Op-Ed: Bird scooters are ruining Venice. I am certain that people who ride Bird scooters don’t read newspapers, so we may speak freely here. The reports you read are true: These electric scooters are everywhere — roads, sidewalks, street corners, parking lots, boardwalks, apartment complex hallways — beeping while stationary and whirring when rolling, ridden mostly by stoic mannequins in flip-flops. Although I would like to avoid them, I have no choice but to consider them because I live in Venice, which is where the first Bird hatched and where the flock is thickest. Bird’s founder and CEO, Travis VanderZanden, says, “We won’t be happy till there are more Birds than cars,” so I guess I am supposed to get used to it. Full disclosure: I am 38 years old and I either drive a car, ride a bike (man-powered), or I walk. I find electric bikes, scooters and skateboards pathetic. But I kept my scoffing to myself. Until now. Because suddenly, almost daily, I have some near-collision with a Bird scooter rider — he who sees nothing but the phone in his hand, thinks of nothing but the next text, and hears nothing but whatever music he has chosen to pump through the white inserts protruding from his wasted ears. He who, despite all that, is still traveling up to 15 mph on the street or sidewalk. Aside from road safety, which has been discussed thoroughly in this and other papers, Bird is also tearing away at the fabric of our Westside society. In Venice and Santa Monica, where Bird is centralized, thousands of people live on the streets, which helps explain the scooter’s popularity. With a press of a throttle button, one can be whizzing along, leaving it all in a blur. Bird calls this solving the “first/last mile” problem. Problem? Is it a problem for a twentysomething to walk a single mile? To most residents, Venice itself is the solution: The weather is perfect, the ocean is a stone’s throw away and each block has something interesting to see. But to walk through Venice is to understand that human misery exists just outside the frame of your Instagram feed. Around the corner from every Venice — excuse me, Silicon Beach — tech company is a collection of human feces, dirty needles and broken bicycle parts. A notorious homeless encampment hugs Google’s massive property line. Every week, the cops try to shoo its residents away, arrest them, shelter them. City crews come to scoop up the bottles of urine, the needles, the tarps, the tents, the bike parts, cardboard boxes and soiled garments. But the encampment always comes back. And so Google simply turns away. Hulu, YouTube, Netflix, BuzzFeed — they all just turn their gaze back toward whatever screen they’re holding. At its 20,000-square-foot Venice Beach headquarters, Bird is building an indoor park. Any concern about what effect these companies are having on the community outside their walls or suggestion that maybe their expansion is exacerbating the homeless problem, is shrugged off. Snapchat, which has drawn the most local ire, snatched up hundreds of thousands of square feet of prime Venice and Santa Monica real estate, displacing myriad local businesses, (semi) affordable housing and a youth homeless shelter. And they wonder why no one brought them a Bundt cake. Building after building has been razed, replaced by some sleek eyesore to be circled ad infinitum by Ubers and Postmates drivers. These services do not empower the community — they fracture it. And now we have the Birds circling, too. But Bird is different from those other tech companies, VanderZanden says. It is providing a service for the less fortunate. “Not everyone can afford their own electric scooter,” he said in an interview last month. We shouldn’t discriminate against people that are renting versus owning.” In certain echo chambers, this might be a logical argument. But if homeless individuals want to hitch a ride on a Bird — perhaps to a job interview, or to visit a loved one, or simply to escape a dangerous situation in an encampment — they’re out of luck. Bird has hand-picked its customers: Digital natives only. Credit card, smartphone, data plan and driver’s license required. I know what some of you are thinking: If Bird has ruined Venice Beach, why don’t I just leave? Pack up and move to Wisconsin? Because within a few years, they’ll be in Wisconsin, too. Whoever you are, wherever you are, they’re coming. And they won’t be happy until there are more Birds than cars.",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-jackson-bird-scooter-20180515-story.html
Bird’s scooters have flooded the streets of major cities. But can the start-up control misbehaving riders?,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,5,23,"Bird’s scooters have flooded the streets of major cities. But can the start-up control misbehaving riders? Scooter rental start-up Bird wants customers to know its electric gadgets are not toys. It has produced educational videos and in-app notices to remind people to ride safely. It has given away helmets to anyone who wants one. And before a customer can even unlock a scooter, he or she has to agree to follow the rules of the road. Still, many riders aren’t getting the message. In cities where the scooters have launched, riders continue to flout local helmet rules, ride on sidewalks and disobey traffic laws. Last week in Santa Monica, a man on a Bird scooter collided with a Honda sedan after zipping through a stop sign, resulting in what the Santa Monica Police Department described as a moderate head injury. The man was not wearing a helmet. The struggle to get riders to keep themselves and others safe highlights one of the biggest challenges faced by the nascent scooter rental industry: How do you get people to behave responsibly when you give them something that looks — and rides — like a toy? In every city with electric scooters, helmet use is low, and even those who know they should wear a helmet while riding often don’t. “I don’t feel like carrying a helmet around with me just for the chance I might want to ride one that day,” said Gabriel Marshall, 28, who uses scooter rentals to commute in San Francisco because he thinks it’s more affordable — and fun — than taking the bus or UberPool. He’s not alone. “What bothers me is I walk around Santa Monica every day and I’ve never seen any of the scooter riders with a helmet,” said Dr. Wally Ghurabi, medical director of the Nethercutt Emergency Center at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica. “They seem to think they’re invincible.” The city’s Fire Department has recorded at least 12 incidents involving Bird scooters since they appeared in Santa Monica last year. At nearby UCLA Medical Center, the ER has seen a few scooter incidents, mostly involving multiple abrasions and scrapes. Providence Health Service’s emergency departments have seen none. Backed with more than $100 million in venture capital, Bird launched in its hometown of Santa Monica last September and has since flooded the streets of cities such as San Francisco, San Diego and Nashville with rechargeable scooters capable of traveling up to 15 miles an hour. Competitors LimeBike and Spin have followed similarly, charging customers a dollar to unlock the scooters and about 15 cents a minute. There are no formal parking spots — riders find the nearest scooter via a mobile app, and are encouraged to leave them on the sidewalk when they’re done. Customers must have a valid credit card and driver’s license, a measure intended to ensure accountability and familiarity with road rules. Those who request a helmet from Bird receive a free one by mail; 22,000 have already been sent out, said company spokesman Kenneth Baer. “Bird clearly urges riders not to ride on the sidewalk, but to ride on the road and in bike lanes where available,” Baer said. Bird says it will shut down accounts of misbehaving users, but the company wouldn’t specify how many customers it has deactivated or why it has cracked down on specific accounts. “While we’ve had very few problems, we thoroughly investigate any reports of abuse and deactivate users when necessary,” Baer said. But the specter of deactivation, the promise of free helmets and the frequency of in-app reminders have not been enough to convince all customers that they must follow the rules. “I’m sure the safety messaging in the app was very comprehensive, but they didn’t actually make me read any of it,” said Rivers Langley, 31, of East Hollywood, who recently rode a Bird scooter without wearing a helmet. “I just pushed ‘I accept’ over and over until the scooter turned on.” Fed up with chaotic riding and haphazard parking in their communities, some cities have taken it upon themselves to regulate scooter companies and their riders. In Santa Monica, an emergency ordinance that passed this year gave the city the ability to impound mis-parked scooters. Bird also agreed to pay $300,000 in city fines. The city of Los Angeles this week began discussing regulation for the scooters, with the Transportation Department proposing a one-year test program that would limit each company — including the start-ups Bird, LimeBike and Jump Bikes — to no more than 2,500 vehicles within city limits, and would impose strict rules for parking and data sharing. In San Francisco, city officials voted Tuesday to offer five companies, including Bird, a permit to each operate up to 500 scooters, allowing for a total of 2,500 scooters on the city’s streets. The city attorney and the Municipal Transportation Agency went an extra step on Thursday, ordering the start-ups to apply for proper permits or cease operations. Aside from permitting, the city’s supervisors have also discussed designating parking areas for scooters to minimize tripping hazards for pedestrians and are currently formulating rules to regulate the use of motorized scooters. In California, riding a motorized scooter without a helmet can result in a $190 fine, although it is unclear how widely the rule is enforced. The Santa Monica Police Department did not have an exact figure for the number of citations that have been issued this year. The Police Department in neighboring Venice said it does not track scooter citations. It’s in the interest of scooter start-ups to keep regulation loose so that the barriers to entry remain low — the easier it is to hop onto a scooter and ride without fear of fines and citations, the more likely people are to sign up and pay for rides. But too little oversight could also become a problem for the start-ups, which have already drawn the ire of local residents and regulators for flooding city streets with scooters. Already, city officials and community members frustrated by poor rider behavior have blamed the companies for providing the scooters and not doing enough to promote safety. After a launch that took a page from the tech world’s “ask forgiveness not permission” playbook, Bird Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden has expressed willingness to play nice with regulators. He signed a “Save Our Sidewalks” pledge that promised to grow the company responsibly, commit to daily pickup of scooters so they’re not haphazardly strewn on sidewalks, and remit $1 per vehicle per day to cities to help build infrastructure to make scooter riding safer. Representatives from other scooter start-ups have also said that they are open to cooperating with regulators. LimeBike, for instance, says it is working with private businesses to allow people to park scooters on private property rather than on sidewalks, and is having discussions with helmet vendors to make it easier for riders to get headgear. The company said it has given away more than 1,000 helmets. Getting people to actually wear the helmets remains a hurdle. Part of the problem, according to those who have studied bike share programs, is that people tend to use bike shares (and, by extension, scooter shares) spontaneously, and few carry a helmet with them at all times. “The data shows that in systems that don’t provide helmets, which is the vast majority, people don’t wear helmets at a very high rate,” said Luke Peters, a researcher at the University of Washington’s Sustainable Transportation Lab, which recently conducted a survey to study Seattle’s city-run station-based bike share system. Seattle’s Pronto Cycle Share offered helmet rentals at each station because of the city’s stringent helmet law, which requires riders of all ages to don protective gear. Paying customers received a code to open a bin near the bikes containing a plastic-wrapped helmet to be returned at the end of the ride. Workers collected, cleaned, re-sealed and redistributed the helmets each day. Pronto Cycle Share shuttered last year because of low ridership and high costs. Preliminary results from the Sustainable Transportation Lab’s survey found that 42% of respondents said they always wore a helmet, 31% said they sometimes wore a helmet, and 27% said they never wore a helmet. The city has since allowed dockless bicycle sharing companies including LimeBike to launch — none of which provide helmets on-site. In a survey of dockless bike share riders, only 16% said they always wear a helmet, 32% said sometimes, while 52% said never. Research is unclear on whether people don’t wear helmets because of access or convenience. Anuj Gupta, deputy city manager of Santa Monica, says the vast majority of electric scooter riders still don’t use helmets. But since Bird started distributing free helmets, “we’ve seen more folks wearing them, and far fewer people are riding on sidewalks.” Most of the scooter injuries Ghurabi has seen in his emergency room occurred on sidewalks where a pedestrian exiting a building is struck. “If you’re a 70-kilogram person and you’re going at 10 miles an hour, the force from that is incredible,” Ghurabi said. “Wear a helmet, ride with caution, ride defensively, and within reason.”",https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-scooter-safety-20180523-story.html
L.A. starts debating rules for electric scooters and bike-share companies,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,5,23,"L.A. starts debating rules for electric scooters and bike-share companies. With electric scooters and short-term bicycle rentals continuing to flood the Westside, Los Angeles city officials have begun to discuss how to regulate the transportation companies to minimize cluttered sidewalks and ensure rider safety. The Transportation Department proposed a one-year test program Wednesday that would limit each company — including the start-ups Bird, LimeBike and Jump Bikes — to no more than 2,500 vehicles within city limits, and would impose strict rules for parking and data sharing. The motorized scooters typically cost $1 to rent, plus 15 cents per minute during the ride, and have exploded in popularity in Southern California’s beach cities, racking up thousands of trips within months. A more flexible and chaotic form of bicycle sharing, which enables users to pick up and drop off bikes anywhere, is also gaining popularity. The influx of wheeled vehicles has sparked complaints from Westside residents who say speeding users have collided with pedestrians and careless parkers have blocked sidewalks and doorways. The Los Angeles proposal would require that the scooters and bicycles be parked in the outer edge of the sidewalk and locked to something, such as a bike rack or a parking meter. In-app directions would guide users to an appropriate spot, officials said. The city’s most controversial proposal would stop the more flexible model of bicycle sharing from competing with L.A.’s existing bike-share system, which is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The bikes would not be allowed within three miles of an existing or a planned Metro bike-share station. Scooters would not be allowed within three miles of downtown. The proposal, which would remove vast swaths of central and west Los Angeles from the companies’ business areas, faced immediate pushback from bicycle advocates and the firms at a City Council committee meeting Wednesday. The committee recommended that the proposed geographic bans be eliminated. John Howland, a representative for scooter company Skip who attended Wednesday’s meeting, called the plan a “downtown monopoly.” Other representatives said city leaders should allow as many options as possible that let Angelenos get around without driving. The ban on scooters and dockless bicycles in downtown, central L.A., Venice and San Pedro could end within six months, once the rental companies establish relationships with the city and show they can follow the laws, city officials said. Other cities have not successfully changed the behavior of the short-term rental companies, or their users, by issuing fines, Transportation Department general manager Seleta Reynolds said. “We think that a better approach is incentivizing good behavior,” Reynolds said, “and rewarding it with the things these companies care most about, which is the size of the fleet and the ability to operate freely throughout the city.” City Councilman Mike Bonin, whose Westside district has already seen an influx of scooters, said he was concerned that the proposal would take away “a huge chunk of the market,” particularly in dense neighborhoods where the scooter rentals have already proved popular. Bonin urged the Transportation Department to eliminate the ban on operating within three miles of Metro bike-share stations and the rule that would require that the vehicles be locked to something when not in use. He also asked the city to reconsider how many vehicles the companies would be allowed to operate. More than 2,500 Bird scooters are already on the street in two City Council districts, and a cap would restrict the company’s “ability to service the community,” said Carl Hansen, the company’s director of government affairs. Councilwoman Nury Martinez, who represents the eastern San Fernando Valley, asked whether the council offices could be involved in determining where the services operate. Then she offered a brief reality check. “We don’t have any dockless bicycles or fancy scooters in my district,” Martinez said. “We’re just trying to cross the street without getting killed.” Metro discussed the scooter and bike-share regulations with Los Angeles in December, but had not seen the city’s final proposal and did not have a position, an agency spokesman said. Since launching in downtown in 2016, Metro’s bike-share system has struggled to attract new users. The bicycles in downtown average less than one trip a day, one of the lowest rates of any U.S. city. The bikes in Venice Beach average about 1.2 trips a day. Critics have said that the system does not serve enough areas, and the neighborhoods where bikes are available — in downtown, San Pedro, Venice and Pasadena — don’t have enough stations. Metro officials have attributed the sluggish ridership to a “lack of a bicycle culture” and residents’ fears of riding in L.A. traffic without protected lanes. On Thursday, Metro’s directors will consider expanding the service to Westlake, Pico Union, Koreatown, Echo Park and Silver Lake, creating a contiguous service area where commuters and tourists can pick up and drop off the bicycles. They will also consider reducing the cost of a half-hour ride to $1.75 from $3.50, and creating a $5 day pass.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-scooters-bike-share-20180523-story.html
City proposing new limits on electric scooters,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,7,"City proposing new limits on electric scooters. The City of Santa Monica is proposing new rules to limit the number of dockless vehicles in the city, including the now ubiquitous scooters from companies like Bird and Lime. Staff are proposing a pilot program that would cap the total number of devices in the city at 1,500 split between up to three companies. The cap could increase to 2,250 depending on the results of the pilot. In addition, companies would be required to adhere to minimum operating requirements in seven categories including maintenance, education, safety, customer service, data sharing and insurance/indemnification. The program will be up for discussion at this Tuesday’s City Council Meeting. Two companies are currently operating in Santa Monica, Bird and Lime. Both companies offer electric scooters via a smartphone app for an initial fee of $1 and 15 cents per minute thereafter. Riders can pick up a scooter from wherever they find it and leave it at their destination. Bird is native to Santa Monica and while it’s proved popular with users, they City administration has been less enamored with the company. The City filed a lawsuit against the company that was eventually settled for $300,000 plus concessions from the company regarding its educational outreach and distribution operations. The City has been regulating the companies under a temporary emergency ordinance that specifies dockless vehicles are subject to the city’s vending regulations and established an impound fee of $60 when the vehicles pose “an immediate hazard or obstruct access.” According to staff, SMPD has been actively enforcing laws related to the scooters. Officers have conducted 623 stops and issued 302 citations in the first three months of 2018, and over 809 stops and issuing 366 citations in the month of May. Staff said the pilot program won’t impede existing efforts to regulate the companies. “This does not deter the City from issuing citations to individual violators of the California Vehicle Code, nor preclude ongoing educational efforts to promote responsible behavior from all who share our city streets,” said the staff report. “Instead, the pilot proposal is designed to directly address the new and very real challenges posed by the introduction of large numbers of new mobility devices. Staff believes this approach is consistent with the Council’s Strategic Goal of promoting a new model of mobility for Santa Monica and the Council’s adoption of Vision Zero to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from roadway collisions.” Staff have recommended all permits for the companies would expire in September of this year to allow implementation of the proposed 16 month pilot program. Council will meet on Tuesday, June 12 in City Hall, 1685 Main St. Closed session begins at 5:30 p.m. with open session beginning no earlier than 6:30 p.m.",https://www.smdp.com/city-proposing-new-limits-on-electric-scooters/166640
Editorial: Scooters aren’t an urban scourge. They’re a solution,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,11,"Editorial: Scooters aren’t an urban scourge. They’re a solution. Motorized scooters are not an urban scourge, and shared bikes are not a blight on society. They’re convenient, affordable ways to travel short distances without getting in a car and driving. If cities are serious about creating alternative modes of transportation that don’t involve polluting cars or bumper-to-bumper traffic, then they ought to develop rules that allow the expansion of shared scooters and “dockless” bikes. The quicker they do so, the better. Here’s how these so-called private mobility services work: Riders download an app on a phone, enter a credit card and then “unlock” an electric scooter or bicycle (electric-powered or not) for use. When the ride is over, the user parks the scooter or bike on the edge of the sidewalk and walks away. In typical Silicon Valley better-to-ask-forgiveness-than-permission fashion, companies have come into cities and dropped hundreds of electric scooters and bike shares on public streets with little regard for rules or permits. Further complicating matters, there is fierce competition among nearly a dozen well-funded startups, each offering its own fleet of shared bikes or scooters, and they all want to be the first and the biggest to capture the market. As result, selected neighborhoods in some cities have suddenly been inundated with scooters and bikes dumped at curbside. (In Dallas, city officials estimated there were 20,000 dockless bikes.) More people using bikes and scooters means fewer car trips, less traffic and less pollution. Just as they were caught unprepared for the arrival of Uber, Lyft and other ridesharing services, cities are struggling to figure out how to allow a car-free transportation option that is proving popular with riders while minimizing the problems, such as bikes blocking sidewalks and careless riders buzzing pedestrians. So far, cities are having trouble finding the regulatory sweet spot. Austin, Denver and San Francisco, to name a few, all ordered the vehicles off the streets until the companies apply for permits to operate. Some cities have imposed tight caps on the numbers of bikes or scooters allowed, at least during the initial, legal rollout. San Francisco, for example, will limit the total number of scooters allowed in the city to 1,250 for the first six months — down from an estimated 4,000 that were on the street in recent months. In Los Angeles, the Department of Transportation has proposed prohibiting dockless bikes from operating within three miles of an existing or planned Metro bike share station. Scooters would not be allowed within three miles of downtown. The idea is to prevent the upstarts from competing with the publicly funded bikes, which have struggled to attract riders. (Metro recently voted to lower the price of rides and expand to dockless bikes.) But carving out a monopoly for Metro’s bike share would ban the privately operated services from some of the city’s most dense, walkable and transit-friendly neighborhoods. These are communities that need good first-mile, last-mile options, and that are ideal launching points for new mobility services. L.A.’s goal should be to make it easier for people to get around without a car, not to protect publicly funded bike shares from competition. Sure, it’s easier for cities to manage small fleets in select neighborhoods. And there are real safety issues posed by the profusion of bike and scooter services, including the availability of helmets for riders and the navigability of sidewalks and curbs. But cities’ desire to control and contain these new services threatens to stymie their growth and value, while also preventing the market — that is, consumers — from determining where the services should be deployed. Scooters and dockless bikes are popular precisely because they are ubiquitous, which makes them convenient. You don’t have to hunt around. You grab, pay and go. Capping the number of scooters or barring the bikes from certain neighborhoods limits their utility, makes them less convenient for riders and potentially consigns them to the wrong territories. Yes, there will be growing pains as companies — and riders — stop acting like disrupters and become responsible users of the public space. Cities have every right to fine and, if necessary, ban bad operators that fail to manage their fleets in a safe manner or that litter public rights-of-way with their bikes and scooters enough to become a public nuisance. And transportation officials, like those in L.A., are right to prod companies to ensure their services are not just clustered in tony neighborhoods, but spread to poorer communities that would both embrace and benefit from low-cost, first-mile, last-mile mobility options. But city leaders need to keep their eyes on a bigger payoff: More people using bikes and scooters means fewer car trips, less traffic and less pollution. Scooters are not a scourge; they’re a solution.",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-scooters-regulations-20180611-story.html
New pilot program forgoes hard caps on dockless e-scooters,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,13,"New pilot program forgoes hard caps on dockless e-scooters. Electric scooter companies showed strength in numbers Tuesday, calling on their fleet of independent contractors and tech enthusiasts to argue against a cap on the number of dockless electric devices in Santa Monica city limits. During a five-hour debate over a new pilot program to govern the disruptive companies, the City Council declined to set finite limits the number of devices zipping around town. “Cities like Santa Monica haven’t seen so much disruption on our streets since Henry Ford flooded them with Model Ts and scared the horses,” said Councilmember Kevin McKeown. Under the new ordinance, the city will select up to four vendors to operate during a 16-month program. Vendors will be required to meet utilization targets to ensure efficient use of both bikes and scooters. City staff had recommended capping the number of devices around 1,500 – roughly the amount of Birds already strewn on city sidewalks on any given day. However, representatives for Bird, Lime and Ofo Bikes argued the scooters’ ubiquitous nature is crucial to their success, allowing the convenience of a cheap electric ride on any street corner. “The market will, in the end, establish the number of devices…none of these companies have the incentive either financially or operationally to have more devices on the streets than are really being used,” said Philip Recht, a lobbyist for Beijing-based Ofo Bikes, which is currently valued at $3 billion, with 10 million yellow bicycles deployed in 20 countries. According to City Hall, the pilot program will Set a dynamic device cap based on utilization. Require vendors to create interactive safety education for users and increase the availability of helmets for riders at the time of use. Require operators to share real-time utilization data with the City. Allow up to four operators to be selected to participate made up of at least two electric scooter and two electric bike options. Ensure equitable distribution throughout the City. Require operators to develop systems that will remedy improper parking, including pick up/drop off zones and incentives. Enhance operator customer service and responsiveness to resident and user complaints, including a 24-hour hotline. Set forth a broader list of recommended program components through which partners could be evaluated during the pilot term. Several cities across the globe have experienced escalating levels of dockless device clutter as companies race to capture market share in a brand new business. In Dallas, for example, various companies littered streets with as many as 20,000 bikes in their quest to attract loyal riders with convenience. Nine months after their debut, Bird’s chief legal officer pivoted from disruption to cooperation. In February, the start-up settled a lawsuit from the city arguing the company operated without the proper business licences, agreeing to pay $300,000 in fines. The E-scooter company has now expanded into cities across the United States and is reportedly worth $1 billion. “We are so far from perfect,” lawyer David Estrada said, while offering a menu of solutions to appease Councilmembers’ concerns about public safety. City leaders said they received more than 1,000 duplicate emails from Bird riders supporting the controversial company. Several speakers complained Bird has refused to cooperate with the Santa Monica Police Department and the public to punish users who violate the vehicle laws or carelessly dump scooters on driveways and wheelchair ramps. Bird will be just one of several companies competing for the right to operate in the city. Applicants will have to suggest interactive safety solutions to rampant user violations, as thousands of users illegally ride without helmets and on city sidewalks. The Council also suggested a program to distribute helmets more quickly to first time users, such as a partnership with hotels to provide helmets to tourists. The Council heard from more than fifty public speakers on the issue, including longtime residents who complained careless users run down pedestrians and leave the electric scooters strewn across the public right-of-way. “Basically pedestrians have become the bowling pins of Santa Monica. We are an endangered species. We cannot walk safely down the street,” said resident Bill Davids. Under the pilot program, electric bike and scooter companies will work with the city to establish pick up and drop off zones. Councilmember Terry O’Day urged planning staff to consider leasing street parking spaces to the companies move the devices off sidewalks.",https://www.smdp.com/new-pilot-program-forgoes-hard-caps-on-dockless-e-scooters/166788
Santa Monica tells scooter companies: You can stay — but there are new rules,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,13,"Santa Monica tells scooter companies: You can stay — but there are new rules. Love them or hate them, the scooters are staying in Santa Monica — at least for the next year and a half. That was the conclusion Tuesday night after Santa Monica’s City Council heard from more than 30 impassioned scooter supporters and detractors and grilled scooter rental companies Bird and Lime on how they would be good for Westside citizens. The council ultimately approved a 16-month pilot program that will allow electric-scooter and electric-bike rental companies to continue operating in the city. “This is not a referendum on a single scooter company,” Mayor Ted Winterer said during the four-hour discussion that led to the council’s unanimous approval of the pilot program. “We’re not saying these are the hard and fast rules. We’re experimenting.” The pilot, which begins Sept. 17, was framed as a fact-finding mission to help the city craft longer-term regulations. Cities nationwide have struggled to craft policies on the scooters. There are public safety concerns, as riders tend to drive and park on sidewalks and not wear helmets. But the scooters offer a convenient, eco-friendly and low-cost transportation option. That’s appealing to cities, which want to keep traffic and pollution down but have limited funds for public transit. The scooters have proved popular with riders, who can find the nearest available one by using a mobile app, then rent it by scanning a code on the handlebar with their phone. Both Bird and Lime charge $1 to rent a scooter, plus 15 cents per minute of use. Riders can abandon the scooters anywhere when they’re done. Under Santa Monica’s pilot program, electric-scooter and electric-bike companies will have to apply for a permit and pay an annual fee of $20,000 and a per-device fee of $130. That’s a lot more money for the city: Currently, the companies are paying only for a permit that, according to the municipal code, starts at $50 a year, plus a $60 impound fee for each of its scooters that poses an immediate hazard or obstructs access to buildings. Companies that receive permits will also have to agree to create interactive safety education for riders, such as sending push notifications to customers’ phones to tell them if they have been riding unsafely. They’ll also have to share real-time data with the city; ensure that their scooters are evenly distributed throughout the city; establish a 24-hour hotline to field complaints; and make sure that improperly parked scooters are promptly moved. The city will also impose a “dynamic” cap on the number of scooters each company is allowed to deploy, which will be determined by whether the company’s scooters are getting enough use. A company that can demonstrate that each of its scooters is being used at least three times a day may have its cap increased, while a company that shows lower ridership will be ordered to reduce the number of scooters it deploys in the city. The pilot proposed by city staffers had called for an initial cap of 1,500 scooters total, with the option to increase that cap to 2,250. Cities such as San Francisco and Austin, Texas, have implemented scooter caps as part of their pilot programs. But the cap was a point of contention during the meeting, with council members Gleam Davis and Terry O’Day expressing concern that such limitations would encourage scooter companies to deploy their devices only in high-density areas, leaving outlying residential parts of Santa Monica without access to the scooters. Bird and Lime had also opposed the cap, in large part because they are jostling for market share, and the more scooters they deploy, the more customers they’re likely to gain. Both companies are backed by venture capital funds, which typically measure a company’s success on how rapidly it has grown. Bird organized a Tuesday rally outside City Hall to make an environmental sustainability argument against the proposed cap. Around 50 Bird supporters showed up, many wearing shirts emblazoned with the phrase “Save our planet,” and carrying colorful signs that read, “Let the birds fly,” “More birds less traffic” and “Free the birds.” David Estrada, chief legal officer for Bird, was one of a handful of speakers to talk about how Bird can help Santa Monica achieve its goals related to climate change, and why the cap would hurt progress. Estrada said around 1,500 to 2,000 Bird scooters operate in Santa Monica on a daily basis. The proposed pilot program would have limited Bird to 500 scooters. Deputy City Manager Anuj Gupta and the city’s mobility division manager, Francie Stefan, had said that the proposed cap sought to level the playing field for scooter companies, so that competitors wouldn’t try to one-up one another by flooding the city with more scooters. Gupta said Wednesday that adopting a dynamic cap will make things less predictable and could result in a surge in the number of scooters, but that he felt good about the decision because council members made clear that the increase will happen only if there is demand. Several issues remain unresolved. California law requires people who ride motorized scooters to wear helmets, but compliance in Santa Monica is low — City Manager Rick Cole put it at 2%. It’s also unclear where scooters should be parked if not on sidewalks, and what the city will do about riders who behave recklessly. The scooters “propose an unusual enforcement challenge,” Cole said. “You can’t run them down with foot patrol, you can’t chase them down with bike patrol, and it’s dangerous to pursue folks in a squad car.” “So maybe we should get the Police Department some scooters,” Councilwoman Gleam Davis said, to laughter. At least a dozen Santa Monica residents pleaded for the city to crack down harder on the scooter companies, increase ticketing for riders who break rules (so far, the city has issued 668 traffic citations to scooter riders, according to city data), and think twice before issuing permits to homegrown start-up Bird, which launched last year without first consulting the city. “For nine months, since Sept. 17, Bird droppings have been lining the city,” Harriet Epstein, a Santa Monica resident, said at the meeting. “The City Council should concentrate more on the safety aspect than on whether [Bird] can survive and how many scooters they need to make it profitable.” Prohibited acts such as riding scooters on sidewalks, riding without a helmet, and improper parking remain rampant, posing a safety issue for pedestrians, Epstein said. Bird struck a conciliatory tone at the meeting, with Estrada saying the company hadn’t been perfect and wants to “clean that up.” He also chalked up some of Bird’s missteps to its youth, saying that the company had been around for only nine months and that the council should “think about what cars were like when they’d been around for nine months.” Councilwoman Sue Himmelrich shot down the comparison between scooters and cars, telling Estrada: “I’m a lawyer. Sorry, that doesn’t work on me.” Before approving the pilot program, council members emphasized that they expected better from the scooter companies, that safety was paramount and that the city could suspend or revoke permits from companies that don’t play by the rules. Lime, which launched its scooters in Santa Monica last week, welcomed the pilot and said in a statement that it looks forward to working with the city. Euwyn Poon, co-founder of San Francisco scooter rental start-up Spin, said Wednesday that since the pilot was approved, Spin is “definitely considering launching” in Santa Monica, and that it plans to apply for permits when the city begins accepting applications in July. Bird’s representative was also pleased. Around midnight, Estrada left the chamber hall with a smile on his face. He said he was happy that City Council members amended the pilot program to lift the cap on the number of scooters allowed to operate. “I think this is a terrific result,” he said. “The council was thoughtful and balanced.”",https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-santa-monica-scooter-rules-20180613-story.html
San Pedro getting ‘Lime’ scooters back — for good? ,Daily Breeze,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,14,"San Pedro getting ‘Lime’ scooters back — for good? Love ’em or hate ’em, the electric Lime Scooters that turned up briefly a few weeks ago in San Pedro to join the Lime Bikes are coming back as a permanent fixture. The three-day “pop-up” trial run of 150 scooters over the first weekend in June was deemed a successful run with 1,400 rides logged. Later this month — a date has yet to be announced — the scooters will return for good to join the Lime Bikes that already have become a local bike share fixture. They are produced by LimeBike, a tech start-up that provides rental bikes that are accessible by using a smart phone app linked to a credit card. San Pedro currently is the only Los Angeles city community that will have the scooters, according to the office of Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino. While they were not as successful as they were in Santa Monica, Buscaino spokesman Branimir Kvartuc said the scooters were “relatively successful” during San Pedro’s trial run. Not everyone appreciates the dockless bike-share trend. While the bikes and scooters are equipped with GPS to make them theft resistant, they sometimes end up cluttering neighborhoods and used in pranks, all of which has prompted a backlash. Lime’s bike-share service won fans among college students at Cal State Northridge, who hope on the bikes to traverse across the sprawling campus. But some residents and business owners near the university complained to the Los Angeles City Council about having to navigate around the bikes left on residential sidewalks, around businesses and occasionally on private property. After listening to weeks of complaints from citizens, the Santa Monica City Council voted this week to try a 16-month pilot program that will limit the number of dockless scooters and bicycles, as well as capping the number of companies that can operate such services in the city. In San Pedro, pranksters wedged a lime bike underneath the standing fisherman figure that is part of a memorial statue on Harbor Boulevard. Other bikes have reportedly been spotted on school rooftops and in the water at Cabrillo Beach. Some bikes are stripped of parts such as seats. But the bikes have their fans as well who cite their affordability and convenience for short hops around town. They are self-locking and can be left anywhere but are not supposed to block sidewalks, streets or other areas where pedestrians are. The scooters are unique in that they require overnight charging by Uber-like contractors known as “juicers” at LimeBike. They are paid $5 per scooter. The scooters also require users to be 18 or older and helmets. They reach speeds of between 15 and 20 mph and cannot be ride on sidewalks. They use the same smartphone app as the Lime Bikes. The Lime Bikes came to the Harbor Area in November, just months after the Port of Los Angeles unveiled a bike-rental docking system on the waterfront. The dockless bikes and scooters, though, need no costly infrastructure making them appealing to cities and counties that foot the bill for the pricey docking stations.",https://www.dailybreeze.com/san-pedro-getting-lime-scooters-back-for-good
City Council Votes to Ban Electric Shared Scooters in West Hollywood,WEHO ville,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,19,"City Council Votes to Ban Electric Shared Scooters in West Hollywood. The City Council voted Monday night to ban electric shared scooters (and bicycles) in West Hollywood and rejected a proposal by City Hall staff to launch a pilot program to test ways to regulate the increasingly popular vehicles. The city’s Public Works and Planning and Development Services departments brought forth the proposal in response to a “rogue launch” on March 30 by Lime Scooters of its scooter fleet in West Hollywood. Lime distributed scooters around the city that could be rented via a mobile phone app. A rider was able to drop the scooters wherever he ended his trip, and Lime used GPS technology to track and recover them. The proposed pilot project would allow a maximum of three companies to each located up to 50 scooters within West Hollywood for six months. The companies would be required to share ridership data with the city, which would put restrictions on hours of operation and location of the scooters. The pilot project drew opposition from Manny Rodriguez, a resident of West Hollywood West, who contested the argument that use of scooters protects the environment by reducing driving of cars. “We do not live in a movie studio back lot, a college camps or an Amazon warehouse,” Rodriguez said. “…. Our city should not bargain with companies that depend on the public space for their private gain.” Councilmember John Heilman said he opposed the pilot program in part because of Lime’s unauthorized launch in West Hollywood, which he likened to a company dropping vending machines on city sidewalks. “It’s actually quite outrageous for a company that knows that they don’t have permits to do this…. ,” Heilman said. “I think that’s just really a very bad business tactic.” He described the use of scooters as “a joy ride. They don’t have helmets, they’re not respectable of pedestrians on the sidewalk.” Mayor John Duran also opposed the pilot program, arguing that the city’s sidewalks already are congested. The proposed pilot program would bar scooters from city sidewalks, however they already are being ridden there. Councilmember John D’Amico supported the pilot program and suggested giving the city’s Transportation Commission the discretion to increase the number of permitted scooters if there wasn’t an adequate supply of them in certain areas of the city. D’Amico noted that the scooters already are being ridden into West Hollywood from nearby cities. “I’m definitely not interested in posting officers at the borders and telling them that ‘you have to get off’,” he said. “Now, what do we do when people ride them?” D’Amico asked after his fellow Council members voted to ban them. “Are we creating another category of miscreants?” Dan Mick, the city’s code compliance supervisor, said it isn’t illegal for individuals to drive rented scooters into West Hollywood nor is it illegal for WeHo residents who own their own scooters to drive them, so long as don’t use them on sidewalks. Tara Worden, an assistant city planner, said that if scooters are left parked on sidewalks, the city would more easily be able to figure out who had left them if it were collaborating with the scooter rental companies in a pilot program. Representatives from Lime and Spin Scooters spoke in favor of the pilot program. Bird, a Santa Monica-based scooter rental company whose vehicles are seen on WeHo’s sidewalks, did not offer an opinion on the proposal.",https://www.wehoville.com/2018/06/19/city-council-votes-ban-electric-shared-scooters-west-hollywood/
LA moves forward with regulations for dockless bikes and scooters,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,6,28,"LA moves forward with regulations for dockless bikes and scooters. The rules would limit the number of vehicles companies can put on city sidewalks. The Los Angeles City Council is crafting new rules to regulate dockless bikes and electric scooters, and the policy will likely limit how many vehicles companies can disperse on city streets and sidewalks. The bikes and scooters, which can be rented through a smartphone app and left on the curb once a ride is finished, have become a common sight on the Westside. More recently, they’ve begun popping up in more central neighborhoods as well, like Hollywood and—briefly—the Arts District. The dockless vehicles have attracted plenty of riders, but not everyone is happy with the new bikes and scooters. Critics complain that riders hog the pedestrian right-of-way and leave vehicles haphazardly dispersed on sidewalks. After being flooded with dockless vehicles last year, the city of Santa Monica approved regulations on “shared mobility devices” earlier this month. Los Angeles officials are now considering similar guidelines that would address concerns about the vehicles, while allowing companies to expand into new areas. At least one councilmember wants to entice dockless providers to set up shop in the auto-centric San Fernando Valley. “I don’t have any dockless bicycles or scooters or any of that fancy stuff,” said Councilmember Nury Martinez, who represents much of the central Valley, in a city transportation committee meeting last month. “We’re simply trying to cross the street without getting killed.” On Wednesday, the committee approved preliminary regulations for the vehicles, including a cap that limits the number of vehicles companies can deploy in the city to 3,000. That number could go up if companies agree to serve areas they might otherwise have ignored. If companies expand operations into “disadvantaged communities,” lower-income areas identified by the California Environmental Protection Agency, they would be able to add an additional 2,500 vehicles to their fleet—to be deployed in those areas. At Martinez’ request, the number of additional vehicles would be double that in the Valley. That means that companies could put up to 8,000 bikes on city streets, as long as 5,000 of them were in low-income neighborhoods in the Valley. Such a large incentive may seem like a dramatic step, but transportation department officials told the committee that luring companies away from more affluent areas in the LA Basin could otherwise be a challenge. The cap on fleet size wouldn’t be the only rule companies have to abide by. The guidelines recommended Wednesday also impose safety standards on vehicles, requiring them to have lights and reflectors, and for electric vehicles to have working motors. Companies would also have to provide ridership data to the city and will be responsible for ensuring that vehicles are parked in appropriate places where they don’t block the path of pedestrians. The rules still need to be approved by the full City Council before going into effect. Even then, they won’t be set in stone. Transportation officials would have leeway to adjust limits on fleet size, should companies provide data that proves their vehicles are popular enough that more are needed. Councilmember Mike Bonin, who leads the transportation committee, stressed the importance of ensuring residents aren’t overwhelmed by the number of new bikes and scooters in their neighborhoods. “This is an exciting new mobility option for Los Angeles,” said Bonin Wednesday. “If we don’t strike the right balance, it won’t succeed.”",https://la.curbed.com/2018/6/28/17511568/los-angeles-dockless-bikes-electric-scooter-rules
Huntington Beach takes steps to temporarily ban bicycle and scooter rental services,Daily Pilot,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,7,3,"Huntington Beach will move forward on establishing a temporary ban on bicycle and scooter sharing services pending a study session on how to regulate them. City Attorney Michael Gates will present a formal proposal during the July 16 meeting of the City Council, which voted unanimously Monday night to move ahead with the ban. Transportation rental companies such as Lime and Mobike enable customers in various cities to unlock and rent bicycles or scooters using a mobile app. The business model is similar to the Lyft and Uber car ride services. Sharing services are a “green” transportation alternative and can ease traffic congestion, but they also can create a public nuisance and safety concern, said Councilman Patrick Brenden, who proposed the ban. Santa Monica and San Francisco have deliberated how to regulate such services and limit “littering” caused by bikes and scooters being left around town, Brenden said. Chief Assistant City Attorney Mike Vigliotta said sharing services “can’t just leave the bikes” in Huntington Beach without an agreement from the city. Plaque plan for Patriot Point In other business Monday, the City Council directed staff to return with a proposal to buy and install a plaque dedicated to Zach Martinez, a Vietnam veteran who raised the American flag on a bluff above the ocean on Memorial Day 2010 and created Patriot Point.

"Column: Bird scooters — so much fun, so damn dangerous",Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,7,6,"Column: Bird scooters — so much fun, so damn dangerous. Daniela Rivera was standing in the alley in front of my garage in Venice, her eyes red and teary. Her knees were covered in blood, which was dripping down her legs. She was holding the handlebars of a Bird scooter. It seemed as if Evan Reiner, her boyfriend, was coaxing her to get back on. They were my daughter’s age, mid-20s. I got out of my car, opened a camping chair and told Rivera to sit down. I’m no first responder, but I knew she was soon going to be in a lot of pain. And I knew she definitely should not be riding that thing. I brought out warm compresses, antibiotic ointment, bandages and Advil. Reiner tenderly administered first aid, while I fetched three vodka rocks. After an hour or so, Rivera, an actress, was feeling better. She and Reiner, a musician and butcher, took off, leaving the Bird in my alley. I sighed. When Bird electric scooters began showing up around Santa Monica and Venice last fall, they really tickled me. The concept was so liberating: unlock the scooter with your phone, then zoom off, ditching it wherever you fancy. But then I crashed. A bicyclist with headphones didn’t hear me yelling when she turned in front of me on the bike path. I went down on both knees. My head smacked the concrete. Thank God I was wearing the helmet that Bird sent me for free. Without it, I would have cracked my cheekbone. I have not ridden a Bird since. I often hear people claim electric scooters are just as safe as bicycles. I don’t think so. “The electric motor gives you instant acceleration, instant torque,” said Luis Levy, who owns a Santa Monica PR and marketing agency and is not a fan of Birds. Levy, who grew up riding a gas-powered scooter in Brazil, was almost run down by a Bird last March when he and his wife were walking on Fourth Street in Santa Monica during a light rain. “I heard a noise like someone skidding and turned around and see a guy on a Bird, his wheels locked, coming at us fast.” :: The Bird business model, created by former Lyft and Uber executive Travis VanderZanden, is bolstered by the absolutely transparent fiction that people will abide by the rules. Few riders don helmets, which are required. Lots of people ride double — even with small children — which is verboten. People ditch them on sidewalks, creating hazards for pedestrians. You’re supposed to be at least 18 and have a driver’s license to ride a Bird, a requirement that is routinely flouted. Now the California Legislature appears to be ready to sign off on a new law that would allow anyone 18 and older to ride without helmets. Bird is the bill’s sponsor. Amid an avalanche of unflattering publicity, Bird has also launched what it calls a pledge to “Save Our Sidewalks” and has asked the CEOs of other similar companies — Limebike, Ofo, Mobike and Jump — to sign on. Each company would commit to reducing street clutter by putting their bikes and scooters only where they are used, to refrain from expanding unless vehicles are used three times a day, and to remitting $1 per vehicle per day to cities for bike lanes and safety programs. “We have all seen the results of out-of-control deployment in China,” wrote VanderZanden. “Huge piles of abandoned and broken bicycles, over-running sidewalks, turning parks into junkyards, and creating a new form of pollution … We cannot let this happen to our cities.” So far, says Bird, only VanderZanden has signed on. :: When I tweeted out a request to hear from people who had been in a Bird-related crash, I got an earful. In March, a 39-year-old Los Angeles mother of six named Sharona Kaplan swerved to avoid a toddler who had run in front of her Bird on the beachside bike path in Santa Monica. Kaplan fell forward, breaking both bones in her right arm. Three days later, a surgeon put plates and pins in her arm. Though she is eventually expected to make a full recovery, she has physical therapy twice a week and has been unable to pick up her baby, who was 8 months old at the time of the crash. Her health insurance says her car insurance should pay her medical bills; her car insurance says it won’t cover a crash on a two-wheeled vehicle. UCLA senior Zach Johnson was asleep in his Westwood apartment when he was awakened by police officers who told him that someone had thrown a Bird scooter through the rear window of his 2010 Jetta, parked on Landfair Avenue. He traipsed outside in his pajamas to find a Bird half in his car and half out. He ended up paying $300 to have the window replaced. After he sent the company the scooter’s ID number — at Bird’s request — the company stopped responding to him. Probably the most distressing story came from a Westside tech entrepreneur who did not want me to use her name because she is contemplating suing Bird. She and her 7-year-old son were walking on a sidewalk at UCLA when a Bird rider crashed into her at full speed, briefly knocking her unconscious. “My bad,” she recalled the young man saying before he rode away. Her doctor likened the force of impact to being tackled by a football player. Her concussion has caused her to miss work and lose money. “I’m sure they are going to say they have zero liability if someone behaves irresponsibly,” she told me. “But if they know it’s a somewhat dangerous product, isn’t it evil of them to do that?” In emails she provided to me, she asked Bird to identify the rider to her and ban him from future use. Bird would only say that it had taken appropriate measures, and refused to divulge the rider’s name or any other information to her. (A Bird spokeswoman told me the company investigates all complaints but does not reveal rider data “absent a formal legal process.”) Hannah Dewit is the only Bird rider I have ever met who actually used the scooter the way the company intended, to cover that “last mile” between public transportation and her office. But as she pointed out, the scooter does not replace a car, as its proponents always proclaim. Despite what enlightened urban planners would like to believe, the Bird and its various relatives mainly replace walking. A few months ago, Dewit, 23, who lives downtown, was scootering on a sidewalk from her Santa Monica office to the Expo Line after work. As she rode down a curb cut to cross the street, she encountered uneven pavement. Her backpack shifted, and she tumbled into the street, breaking her arm near her shoulder. “What would be the point of telling Bird?” she said when I asked if she had alerted the company. She accepts responsibility for the accident. “I’m sure that in the agreement, I signed over my ability to sue them, otherwise they couldn’t function as a company because everyone would be suing them for everything.” The other day, Luis Levy sent me links to two crash videos. One was a minor Bird-on-Lime collision on the bike path where Venice meets Santa Monica. The other was the aftermath of a more serious accident on Monday. Paramedics were loading a downed Bird rider onto a stretcher. “I’m terrified someone is going to die,” Levy said. Me too. And it’s probably just a matter of time.",https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-abcarian-bird-scourge-20180706-story.html
"Amid massive chaos over e-scooters, Long Beach actually does the right thing: makes room for them",Long Beach Post,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,7,24,"Amid massive chaos over e-scooters, Long Beach actually does the right thing: makes room for them. Meandering the streets of Venice, my partner and I—a pair that often takes random if not needless trips to various parts of L.A. every week because I have an insatiable need to know what other cities are doing compared to Long Beach—stood aghast after taking a pause and gawking at the sidewalks of Abbot Kinney: a tangle of electronic scooters sat in every place imaginable, from the middle of the street—no joke—to the middle of the sidewalk in mini-heaps of four or five. - ADVERTISEMENT - Pedestrians, rightfully irked, would eye them distastefully as they maneuvered around them. We even watched as one man, along Washington Boulevard, motored up toward a bar entrance at a good 15 mph on a scooter, slammed to a stop, dropped the scooter in the middle of the entrance, and scooted his lack of consideration into the bar. In other words: I get the frustration (though I think smearing feces on them in protest is a bit dramatic and inappropriate). And for many municipalities, the frustration has been loud enough to sanction various bans on them. San Francisco forced Bird and Lime, the country’s two largest e-scooter operators, off the street until they apply for certain permits. West Hollywood has implemented an all-out ban, much to the chagrin of its younger residents. Rather than dismissing the scooters by banning them—something San Diego is now considering along its boardwalk after a crash caused serious injuries, leading to potential bans in other places misplaced call for safety—Long Beach has done something entirely different. They want to actually create a pilot program around the scooters. Yup, they want to look at how they can actually incorporate an alternative mode of transit rather than being rashly irrational, inviting scooter companies—Bird and Lime included—to work with them to best implement their business model. What does this mean? This means creating hubs where the operator is responsible for returning all the scooters to at the end of each day. This means managing data and figuring out how users are actually using the scooters. This means creating an outline of rules, regulations and riding laws. In other words, Long Beach is looking to make its streets better for all modes of transit, including one that is increasingly popular among younger crowds—they just want to do it in way where we’re avoiding piles of scooters left in random places and evading a possible nuisance. And that deserves applause. See, those young folks in West Hollywood are right about one thing: scooters are quicker and more convenient than bikes—convenience, attached indirectly to laziness, mind you, is arguably the biggest hump in getting folks out of their cars—and they’re far more environmentally sound than vehicles as well as more traffic-efficient. So the real question isn’t about banning them, continuing to socialize large portions of our roads to individual car use, but rather how to accommodate multiple user modes and get people to start using their car less. “The real question that we were attempting to address is: How can we improve mobility?” Eric Widstrand, a traffic engineer with the City of Long Beach, said. “And in this particular case with this pilot program, it’s really about the first-mile, last-mile of people’s commute. That is key. Even more, it’s about something the city itself can manage rather than dismiss or deal with.” Because some have noted that back in the day, indeed, scooters were part of the everyday life of the urban fabric—and I mean back in the day: We had several modes of transportation that catered to efficiency and accessibility—and surely, though the reality is that we’ve handed our streets back to cars, it doesn’t mean we can’t be proactive in figuring out how to retract that. Because clearly, more Americans want more ways to move around outside a car. Lyft bought the country’s largest bike share operator, Motivate, on top of launching Lyft Bikes. Uber has added electric-bike operator Jump and Lime scooters to its app. What this means is that, whether the scooters and electric bikes are controlled or not, by the end of this year, millions of people in the country’s largest cities—over 150 of them—will be able to rent bikes and scooters with the tap of a finger. Cities have to accommodate them—and unlike the majority of those cities, Long Beach is making room for their operation and not running them over. The pilot program will begin to roll out in August, according to Windstrand, and run through October 30. After that, the City will evaluate the performances of each and direct more permanent action.",https://lbpost.com/news/commentary/amid-massive-chaos-over-e-scooters-long-beach-actually-does-the-right-thing-makes-room-for-them
Beverly Hills City Council approves six-month ban on electric scooters,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,7,25,"Beverly Hills City Council approves six-month ban on electric scooters. The Beverly Hills City Council on Tuesday banned the use of motorized scooters in the city for six months, citing public safety concerns as the two-wheelers have become more popular. Under the ordinance, people are not allowed to ride the scooters — or leave them behind — on any public right of way. The council voted 4 to 1 during a special meeting to implement the ban. Vice Mayor John Mirisch was the sole dissenter. City officials have noticed a dramatic uptick in recent weeks in the use of electric scooters, operated by scooter-share start-ups such as Bird, based in Venice, and Lime. The devices have popped up on sidewalks and street corners, and their riders have been involved in several traffic collisions in Beverly Hills, officials said. Recently, police began cracking down on their use. During one week this month, the Police Department handed out more than 100 warnings and citations to riders for not wearing helmets or having a valid driver’s license. Authorities have also removed scooters from sidewalks and streets when they blocked traffic or pedestrians. In its vote, the council pointed to safety risks and the lack of outreach done by scooter companies. City officials indicated that they hoped to meet with representatives of the scooter companies to work on setting rules for their possible future use. In the meantime, police will enforce a “zero-tolerance policy,” including impounding the scooters and handing out citations for vehicle code violations, officials said. Lime said in a statement Wednesday that it hopes to work with the city to roll out a scooter-share program that prioritizes safety while offering clean and affordable alternatives to cars. “Beverly Hills has a history of embracing innovation, from self-driving cars to fiber optic technology. Last night, the city broke from this tradition by slowing down the adoption of innovative mobility solutions that would lead to fewer cars on the road, less traffic congestion and improved air quality,” Sam Dreiman, Lime’s director of strategic development, said in the statement. Last month, Santa Monica approved a 16-month pilot program that will allow electric-scooter and electric-bike rental companies to continue operating in the city. The pilot, which begins Sept. 17, was framed as a fact-finding mission to help the city craft longer-term regulations. Cities nationwide have struggled to draw up rules for the use of the scooters, which are popular among riders. They can find the nearest available one by using a mobile app, then rent it by scanning a code on the handlebar with their phone. There are public safety concerns, as riders tend to drive and park on sidewalks, and not wear helmets. But advocates say the scooters offer a convenient, eco-friendly and low-cost transportation option. That’s appealing to cities, which want to keep traffic and pollution down but have limited funds for public transit. Both Bird and Lime charge $1 to rent a scooter, plus 15 cents per minute of use. Riders can abandon the scooters anywhere when they’re done. Bird and Lime operate in dozens of U.S. cities and have attracted millions of dollars in venture capital funding.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-scooters-beverly-hills-20180724-story.html
Bird scooters last 3 days in Newport Beach before city has them removed,Daily Pilot,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,7,31,"Bird scooters last 3 days in Newport Beach before city has them removed. Newport Beach has clipped Bird’s wings. The popular motorized scooter-sharing start-up dropped at least 50 of its two-wheeled vehicles on the Balboa Peninsula over the weekend. But according to the city, the company did so without giving notice or getting a permit, and residents promptly complained about the dockless electric scooters being left on the sidewalk — one of Bird’s key features is that riders can pick up and leave the scooters anywhere. Now the scooters are gone. “We sent Bird a demand to remove all of their scooters from the city by midnight yesterday; otherwise they faced the possibility of criminal prosecution and/or administrative citation,” Assistant City Attorney Michael Torres said Tuesday. “As of today, my understanding is that most, if not all, of the scooters have been removed from the city’s property.” On Saturday, Bird’s Twitter account encouraged people to “skip traffic and #enjoytheride this weekend” in Newport. On Monday, the company’s mobile app showed the Balboa Peninsula packed with available Birds. By Tuesday afternoon, the Newport map was blank. “In partnership with Newport Beach, we have agreed to remove all Birds from the city while we work to define a framework for operation that works for everyone,” a statement from Bird said Tuesday evening. “We are in close communication with local officials and we look forward to continuing those productive conversations so we can get back to helping people more easily get around Newport Beach.” Bird riders find and unlock available scooters by using the app. Bird charges $1 to rent a scooter, plus 15 cents per minute of use. The scooters reach top speed of 15 mph and can go 15 miles on a charge. Supporters say scooter sharing is convenient, environmentally friendly and fun. Critics say riders are reckless, often driving and parking on sidewalks, riding tandem and not wearing helmets, although the company discourages such behavior and will mail riders free helmets upon request. A similar service recently approached Newport Beach about coming to town, according to a city statement. Staff is reviewing the request from the company, which the city did not identify. Competitors for Venice-based Bird include Lime and Spin, and companies such as Jump Bikes and Motivate provide a similar service with electric bicycles. Newport officials are expected to discuss such services at the Aug. 14 City Council meeting. Companies that rent out electric scooters and bikes have found popularity and detractors around the country in recent months as cities struggle to develop policies. Santa Monica approved a pilot program, set to launch in September, requiring the companies to pay higher fees, develop additional safety education, share real-time data and abide by a “dynamic cap” on the number of devices each company can deploy. In Los Angeles, a city councilman Tuesday proposed banning electric scooters in town until the city begins issuing permits to the companies providing them. Huntington Beach recently placed a four-month moratorium on bike and scooter services to discuss how other cities are regulating them.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-newport-scooters-20180731-story.html

More e-bikes and scooters are on LA streets. Here’s how to ride them. Dockless bikes! Smart bikes! Electric bikes! Scooters! Los Angeles is flooded with new options for getting around—they’re part of a new breed of transportation called “micromobility.” These small vehicles are being touted as replacements for cars: They’re shared, sometimes electric-powered, easier to park, and take up less space on roads. As these new bikes, e-bikes, and scooters made their way onto LA streets starting in 2017, the debate about whether these modes are sidewalk nuisances or gridlock saviors has dominated the narrative. LA lawmakers have passed regulations that allow companies with permits to operate in the city, and other Southern California cities, including Santa Monica, Long Beach, and Culver City, are implementing forward-thinking policies that might portend a real shift in the way Angelenos get around. Since the the availability of these micromobility services as well as the regulations vary widely from city to city—and change dramatically from week to week—it’s important to learn what you’re in for before you get scootin’ or pedalin’. Here’s our guide for how to ride, where to go, and what you need to know. Where can I ride dockless scooters? If you want to take a dockless scooter for a ride, they’re now found throughout the city. But you’ll have the best variety as well as safety infrastructure for riding in Santa Monica. On September 18, 2018 Santa Monica launched a new pilot program with four operators—Bird, Lime, Lyft, and Uber—managing the city’s e-bike and scooter share. In addition to scooters from Bird and Lime, Uber launched Jump electric bikes in the city, and in October, launched Jump scooters. Ride-hailing giant Lyft also debuted its scooters in Santa Monica along with an update to its app that helps users locate the scooters and get public transportation information. Lyft also acquired Motivate, the country’s largest bike-share operator, and will soon be debuting an e-bike in Santa Monica. You can also look for scooters in Culver City, which is operating a pilot program, too. Long Beach, which has great riding infrastructure, also has its own scooter pilot. Although many scooters have been migrating eastward from the beach, the problem with riding most places in LA is that there just aren’t enough protected lanes for riders to feel safe. This is why many people choose to ride scooters on the sidewalk, even though you’re not supposed to. But sidewalk-riding can be dangerous for you, other users of the sidewalk, and cars pulling out of driveways that don’t expect to see someone whizzing by at 15 mph. Where can’t I ride dockless scooters? On September 4, 2018, the city of LA passed regulations on dockless systems, and in March 2019 began allowing companies with permits to put e-bikes and scooters on LA streets. The largest number of vehicles are found on LA’s Westside, Hollywood, Koreatown, and Downtown. Check out the app Scooter Map to see what’s near you. The companies have detailed no-drop zones designated by the city where you can’t park vehicles, which are clearly marked in the apps. Be vigilant when ending your ride. If you see a vehicle parked improperly or try to use a vehicle that’s broken, you can report it using 311. The city of Beverly Hills has made dockless electric scooters illegal—you can’t even ride one through city limits, so steer clear. The no-ride zone is clearly marked in all the apps, and riders are being ticketed. West Hollywood has banned the parking of scooters within city limits, but you’re allowed to ride through the city to get somewhere else. In Santa Monica, the city has put together a guide for riders. Avoid the beach path, where electric scooters of any type are not allowed. Riders are being ticketed and scooters impounded. Also, you cannot ride on the sidewalks anywhere in California, but in Santa Monica it’s heavily enforced. In downtown Santa Monica there are now designated in-street “drop zones” for scooters as well. How far can I ride them? As far as you want—kind of. Technically you could ride Metro Bike anywhere you want as long as you dock it at a station when you’re done. You’ll just be charged for the time. Similarly, the Bike Share Connect network, which encompasses much of the Westside, has very explicit boundaries outlined for where you can lock up its smart bikes. If you lock up a bike outside of the boundary, you’ll be charged $20. For electric scooters and electric bikes, you’re limited to geographic zones as noted in the app, or however long the battery lasts. Or until you reach the Santa Monica Mountains, whichever comes first. Do I need to wear a helmet? If you’re under 18, yes. Otherwise, check local laws. A state law was passed in September 2018 that makes helmet use on scooters optional for anyone over 18. California cities will be able to set their own laws in 2019, although none in LA County have made such laws yet. If you’re riding bike share or a shared e-bike, helmets are only required by law if you’re 17 or under. (If you’re 17 and under you’re not allowed to ride a shared electric scooter.) Based on the types of injuries associated with people riding an unfamiliar transportation mode, a helmet is not a bad idea, especially if you’re riding on busy streets. If you register on Bird or Lime’s app, they’ll send you one for free. Do I need any other gear? Not really. The great part about the design of these bikes and scooters is that they’re designed to be used in regular clothes, even suits, skirts, and dresses. To minimize the potential of your toes getting scraped, you probably don’t want to wear sandals or flip flops, although a lot of people do. All the bike share bikes have big baskets on the front of them where you can stash your belongings so you don’t even need a special type of bag or purse. Lime and Jump’s bikes have smartphone holders. Some scooters, like Razor’s seated ones, have a basket. What apps do I need to download? For most of LA’s micromobility options you’ll need to download an app to locate, unlock, and pay for your rides. To make the most of what LA has to offer, we suggest downloading these apps that will give you a range of options across the region. Lime: The most expansive of the dockless companies, Lime has pedal bikes, electric-assist bikes, and dockless scooters across a very wide geographic area. Bird: The Santa Monica-based startup has scooters to rent. Spin: Yet another startup with scooters, which was bought by Ford. Razor: Yes, the scooter of your youth now has dockless electric scooters. Metro Bike: LA’s station-based system has hubs in Downtown, the Port of LA, and Venice. It’s easily the best way to get around Downtown. You can’t pay for rides on the app, but you can register your TAP card to pay for rides that way. You can also pay for walk-up rides at the station kiosks using a credit card. Social Bicycles: Last year, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and UCLA merged their smart bike systems into the single Bike Share Connect network. Now you can use one bike booked through one app to ride from Hollywood to the beach and a fairly wide area in between. This app will give you access to the entire Bike Share Connect network, from Santa Monica to West Hollywood. You can also ride Long Beach’s bike share using the Social Bicycles app. Uber: Yes, Uber is best known as a way to book rides in cars. But the app now shows Jump electric bikes and scooters where available. Jump: The e-bike company that’s part of Uber also has its own app to find bikes and scooters. Lyft: The ride-hailing app now offers directions to its scooters—and eventually its e-bikes—as well as public transit. Transit: The trip-planning app can locate nearby dockless bikes and scooters, and provide a detailed multimodal itinerary as well as travel time estimates. How much do bikes and scooters cost to rent? Generally, all the systems cost $1 to $2 per ride, with additional fees based on the length—as in time—of your trip. There are also monthly and annual plans, and plans for students and employers. Once you register for each service through an app, you’ll link a credit card to your account, which bills you every time you complete a ride. All the bike share and scooter companies also have options for subsidized passes. These require applications and eligibility is based on income restrictions. Some also have passes for people who don’t use credit cards. Lime offers a local program where qualified members can get 100 pedal-bike rides for $5. Can I use my Metro TAP card? For Metro Bike and Bike Share Connect, yes! When you register your Metro Bike membership on your TAP card, it makes it especially easy to tap out a bike—you won’t even have to use an app. Registered TAP cards also work for Bike Share Connect smart bikes. The biggest news for Metro Bike is that fares have been slashed to $1.75 per trip, meaning rides are now the same cost as taking a Metro bus or train. Plus, since your Metro Bike account can be linked to your TAP card, you’ll soon be able to “transfer” from bus or rail to a bike, and vice versa, saving you even more money. Can I ride my bike or scooter on the sidewalk? If you’re riding a bike, technically, yes—in some cities in LA County. Use this LADOT guide to see where sidewalk-riding is allowed. Most people don’t know this but riding a bike on the sidewalk is legal in the city of LA. The city acknowledges that sometimes the sidewalk is the safest place to ride on a busy street, and allows it, as long as bike riders do not endanger pedestrians. California law says you can’t ride an electric scooter on the sidewalk. A bill tried to change that to make the law similar to bikes. But a lot of people do ride on the sidewalk because there aren’t safe places to ride. When in doubt, walk the bike or scooter. How do I find the safest place to ride? Google Maps and the trip-planning apps Transit and Citymapper have decent bike and scooter directions, but the bigger challenge across the LA region is the lack of infrastructure—there are major gaps in the bike route network and few protected lanes. A handful of LA-area cities like Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and Long Beach have better infrastructure for biking and scooting. Also, be vigilant about potholes and uneven pavement. Bike share bikes are fairly sturdy and can handle a bumpy, unpredictable road. Scooters have tiny wheels and low clearance and you’ll very likely bottom out. Do not ride the scooters downhill—you won’t be able to stop. Can I take a dockless bike or scooter on the train? No, you’re not supposed to. But along many lines, and especially on the Expo Line, most stations have a variety of micromobility options to choose from once you get off. Can I ride at night? Yes, you can ride bikes at night. All of the bike share bikes in LA have pedal-powered lights that activate as you ride. Some scooters do have lights but some are taken off the streets to charge them. Why do I need a drivers’ license to ride a scooter? Good question. This is perhaps the most incongruous state law to govern what should be a smart alternative to driving, but, in the state of California you must have a valid driver’s license to operate an electric scooter. The apps will make you check a box or scan your license before you ride. For bike share, riders must be 16 and over. Scooter share riders must be 18 and over. What’s the difference between dockless and docked bike share? Since late 2017, a half-dozen dockless companies have deployed their bikes and e-bikes on LA-area streets. While traditional “docked” bike-share systems require that bikes be parked in stations where riders can find them, “dockless” bikes use GPS technology and smartphone apps to help riders locate bikes. In the cities that allow them, they don’t have to be locked to anything, and there are no designated pick-up spots or drop-off points. Some cities in LA have “smart bikes,” which are also located by app on a smartphone, but they can’t just be left anywhere, they need to be locked. Riders can lock them to designated hubs for no extra cost, or to any public bike rack for a slightly higher fee. On the Westside, the city’s bike share operator, Metro Bike, uses smart bikes that don’t need to be parked in hubs. The same smart bikes will soon be launched in North Hollywood. Micromobility companies operating in the LA area have also started offering electric bikes and electric scooters, which are dockless as well. These can also be found using apps, which display the location as well as the current battery life (the scooters and bikes get charged at night and put back on streets). What’s the difference between a pedal bike and an electric bike? LA’s hills, mild climate, and long distances make it a perfect candidate for electric bikes. These are bikes with electric motors that offer what’s known as “pedal assist,” meaning you get a boost while you pedal—up to 20 mph—but if you stop pedaling, the bike slows just like it would on a regular bike. Jump, which is owned by Uber, can be found throughout Santa Monica where its e-bikes are part of a pilot program, as well as in the City of Los Angeles as of mid-November. The bright red bikes are technically electric smart bikes since they can be locked to racks. Lime has a limited number of dockless electric bikes on LA streets that don’t have locks. In November 2018, Metro Bike debuted electric bikes as part of its docked bike share system. For a limited time, the bikes are available to rent for the same price as pedal bikes, and can be checked out and returned to any hub. They can be located through Metro Bike app, but they’re also white, making them easy to spot. Metro Bike plans to have at least 300 e-bikes spread across the network. What’s next for LA’s micromobility scene? Watch for traditional station-based systems experimenting with options beyond pedal bikes. And many cities are looking at adding bikes that can serve a wide variety of users. In Detroit, MoGo bike share launched a fleet of adaptive bikes including recumbent bikes, tandems, and cargo bikes.",https://la.curbed.com/2018/7/31/17623336/bird-lime-scooter-bike-app-locations-cost-hours
Here’s why you could see more electric scooters around Long Beach starting this week ,Press-Telegram,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,1,"Here’s why you could see more electric scooters around Long Beach starting this week. Electric scooters could zip their way onto Long Beach streets this week. The scooters, part of a pilot program, are expected to roll out “within the next few days,” adding another prong in Long Beach’s plan to expand green transit options, according to Michelle Mowery, the city’s Mobility and Healthy Living Programs officer. Long Beach’s Office of Sustainability has prioritized clean transportation, and electric scooters will join bikes and electric buses as a way to make the city less dependent on cars. The city began the 120-day pilot program for the ride-sharing scooters in July, establishing a permitting process and regulations for vendors before a formal program is implemented – possibly later this year. The scooter program will be similar to the city’s bike-sharing initiative, allowing riders to pick up scooters at different locations, ride them around and then drop them off somewhere else. Mowery said on Wednesday, Aug. 1, that Long Beach was planning on deploying the scooters that day, but her staff was still fine-tuning some aspects of the pilot program. There are still some “drop zone” locations, proposed by participating companies, that need approval. Those that have gotten the OK are already being installed, including one on Promenade between Broadway and Third Street, and one in the Harvey Milk Promenade Park on Third Street. Sign up for The Localist, our daily email newsletter with handpicked stories relevant to where you live. Subscribe here. “The scooter drop zones are a requirement of the program,” Mowery said. “We’re trying to keep the public right-of-way as cleaned up as possible.” She said each vendor is required to have at least 30 drop zones, and they will be required to move scooters back into their drop zones each evening. “They can’t leave them anywhere in the public right-of-way,” she said. Mowery said there are six companies in various stages of the permitting process for the program, but she declined to provide more information on them. It’s unclear how many scooters will hit the streets at first, but companies are limited to an initial cap of 150. After obtaining one permit, the companies will be able to apply for a second permit for a maximum of 300 scooters per company. Among the other requirements for participating companies is that they must designate at least 20 percent of their scooters in each of three city zones, with the remaining 40 percent being placed wherever they choose. The goal is to ensure there’s adequate availability across the city without any one area becoming overrun. The northwest zone comprises the area of the city that abuts Lakewood and Signal Hill, with a southern border of the Pacific Coast Highway. The northeastern zone encompasses everything east of Signal Hill down to the Pacific Coast Highway and 7th Street. Everything south of the Pacific Coast Highway and its intersection with 7th Street constitutes the third zone. Mayor Robert Garcia has been vocal about his desires to avoid some of the backlash that has been seen in other cities, like San Francisco and Santa Monica. “This scooter pilot is about trying to get the balance right in Long Beach,” Garcia said in a statement, “so our residents can benefit from new transportation options without the adverse impacts other communities have experienced.” The pilot program began in July with a mandatory meeting for interested vendors. Mowery said 12 companies were notified of that meeting, and the remaining six have moved forward since then. The program will come to an end in October, when city staff will use input and feedback from the pilot to create a formal program.",https://www.presstelegram.com/heres-why-you-could-see-more-electric-scooters-around-long-beach-starting-this-week
Razor electric scooters land in Long Beach as city launches much-anticipated pilot program ,Press-Telegram,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,3,"Razor electric scooters land in Long Beach as city launches much-anticipated pilot program. Bundles of red Razor electric scooters were sprinkled across Long Beach on Thursday evening, the first batch to hit the ground as part of the city’s pilot program. It’s a first for both Razor and Long Beach, as the company announced Friday that its Long Beach unveiling marks the launch of its own dockless electric scooter share program. Long Beach’s foray into scooter sharing comes at a time when other cities’ tales have already begun to taint the brand of electric scooters everywhere. In San Francisco, Santa Monica, Venice and elsewhere, scooters have become inseparable from their unchecked riders, zooming along sidewalks and through congested roadways, only to ditch them by littering walkways and storefronts. So how will Long Beach dodge the same fate? According to the city, moving slowly is the key. It took a month for the first permit to be approved and active, and five more permit applications are currently being processed. Although companies all have to undergo vetting, their access to the city is only guaranteed to last through the end of October, when the pilot program ends. The plan is for City Council to then use input gathered throughout the pilot period to determine the program’s ultimate fate, although the city has been tight-lipped about how that may unfold. For Danny Simon, Razor USA’s chief operating officer, Long Beach seems to have been more open about the post-October possibilities. “We’ve heard a variety of scenarios that could happen” once the pilot program ends, he said. But no matter what the city decides, he said, Razor will cooperate. “We’re hoping (the pilot program) rolls seamlessly into a more longer-term program, but again, we’re willing to work with the city in whatever way is best,” Simon said. Simon said he also hopes to circumvent the negative associations. “There’s a few things we’re doing differently” than other companies, he said. “Our goal is to truly be proactive with the scooters, how they are positioned around the city – to resolve complaints before they happen.” Simon said one of the ways the company hopes to dodge criticism is by providing on-the-ground staff around the city to help riders troubleshoot the new gadgets, return them to designated drop zones, and inspect and maintain them every evening. “Every scooter that gets put out on the street every morning – we know it’s a quality scooter, every time,” he said. While that may be a standard that Razor plans to maintain regardless of where it expands, the company’s decision to provide daily maintenance and to return their products back to designated drop zones every evening also happens to be a Long Beach requirement. “We’re trying to keep the public right-of-way as cleaned up as possible,” Michelle Mowery, the city’s Mobility and Healthy Living Programs officer, said of the stipulation. Mowery said she can’t provide the names of other companies while they’re in the midst of the permitting process, but she was clear on the rules they will have to follow. In addition to the maintenance and drop zones, the companies must provide a maximum of 150 scooters and disperse at least 20 percent of their fleet in three different city zones. Companies can apply for a second permit, which would allow them a cap of 300 scooters, but they would still have to keep at least 20 percent of them in each zone. Companies also have to provide riders with free helmets within 24 hours of a request, respond to complaints of misplaced scooters within two hours and provide a monthly report to the city on trip data, user demographics and contacts with police, among other requirements. Long Beach’s decision to regulate ahead of time is likely to save it from the headaches that cities like Los Angeles and El Segundo are experiencing as they try to backtrack and pass laws after scooters have already proliferated. This week, a Los Angeles City Councilman attempted to place a temporary ban on scooters until regulations are passed, and El Segundo has created its own pilot program — after both Bird and Lime scooters showed up unpermitted earlier this summer. For Simon’s part, he said none of Long Beach’s provisions proved overly burdensome. “The interesting thing about these programs is, for many cities, it’s a new thing they’re trying to wrap their arms around,” he said. Long Beach has been “really helpful and allowed us to have an open channel of communication, so overall, we’ve been very happy with it.” When it comes to selling the service to Long Beach residents, the city says scooters are just another tool in the zero-emission belt. As Long Beach powers ahead with its sustainable transit plans, scooters seem like an obvious addition. But preempting backlash is still paramount. Before Razor arrived on the scene, Mayor Robert Garcia embarked on his own PR campaign for the program. “We are watching the scooter pilot closely to address any challenges that arise so we can see if this innovative form of transportation can work for Long Beach residents and visitors,” the mayor said Friday. It’s unclear when the other companies will roll out their own fleets, but for now, Razor will stand in as Long Beach’s attempt to get right what so many other cities have gotten wrong. Riders who want to test the waters along with the city can do so for free as Razor celebrates its rollout. Long Beach riders’ first three rides will be free, up to 15 minutes per ride. If those rides go beyond 15 minutes, riders will be charged the standard rate of 15 cents per minute. After those free rides, the service costs $1 to start per use and 15 cents for every additional minute. Riders must be at least 18, have a valid driver’s license and wear a helmet. To use the scooters, riders must download the Razor Share app, which shows a map of scooter locations and can scan the scooter’s barcode to activate it for use. Simon said Razor plans to host community events throughout Long Beach in the next week, where residents can test out the scooters and receive the requisite free helmet. Details of those events have not yet been released.",https://www.presstelegram.com/razor-launches-its-electric-scooter-share-program-in-long-beach
L.A. City Council Committee Wants to Lower Speed of Electric Scooters,NBC Los Angeles,NBC,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,8,"L.A. City Council Committee Wants to Lower Speed of Electric Scooters. A Los Angeles City Council committee refined some proposed regulations for dockless electric scooters Wednesday, recommending that their top speed be capped at 12 mph while also creating a conditional use permit system for them and other emerging mobility devices. The Transportation Committee had previously approved a set of regulations for the electric scooter industry in June, but brought them back to make further revisions. Councilman Mike Bonin, who chairs the committee, said he wanted to make changes after he heard some companies were considering raising the speed level of their scooters to be more competitive. Bird, which is operating scooters in several Westside communities, currently offers devices with a top speed of 15 mph, Bonin said. Another company active in the city, Lime, says on its website that its scooters have a top speed of 14.8 mph. Bonin also continued to express support for the scooters despite his fellow committee member, Councilman Paul Koretz, pulling his support for them last week and calling for a temporary ban on them in the city until full regulations are in place. ""With any form of transportation, whether it's bicycles or cars, or scooters, people need to obey the laws. And this is a little more confusing at first because it's a relatively new mode of transportation for folks, so it's going to take both smart regulation and enforcement,'' Bonin told City News Service. The scooters work through a phone app which allows people to find and unlock the devices and drop them off anywhere they are allowed, with no docking station or kiosk required. The amendments approved Wednesday would allow for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to approve or revoke conditional use permits for companies already operating in the city, but would not allow them to expand to new areas until the final regulations are approved the council. In June, the Transportation Committee approved regulations that would allow for controlled growth of the devices, with a cap of 3,000 devices per provider. Operators will also have the opportunity to add up to 2,500 more devices if they are located in disadvantaged communities, and they can add an additional 5,000 in disadvantaged communities in the San Fernando Valley. If companies can demonstrate at least three rides per day per device and adhere to all rules and regulations, the general manager of LADOT each quarter can allow for providers to add 5,000 more devices. Koretz introduced a motion last week to ban the operation of electric scooters until the city drafts full regulations on their use, and Beverly Hills recently invoked a six-month ban. Koretz repeated his concerns about safety and said he has seen about 1,000 scooters on the streets in his district, but few people operating them legally while riding on sidewalks, without helmets or with children driving them. However, Koretz did not object to the amended regulations that Bonin proposed. Koretz said he had recently been confronted by a 12-year-old who said he was going to run for City Council when he turned 18 so he could overturn Koretz's proposed ban on scooters. Both Bird and Lime require drivers to be at least 18 and have a valid driver's license. ""Well the fact that he's mad because he's a regular user of these at 12 sort of makes my point,"" Koretz said. Bonin told City News Service he believes the public will become more aware of the rules and laws around scooters. He said the police department conducted an awareness campaign in Venice over the weekend where no citations were issued but several hundred people were told to get off a scooter if they were driving it illegally and issued a warning. The amended regulations creating the conditional use permit would also apply to future -- and unforeseen -- tech/mobility devices, Bonin said. ""The anticipation is that there will be other forms of stuff coming down the pipeline,"" Bonin said. ""I want to make sure we don't get caught in a situation where we're treating each thing as an individual phenomenon. ""I want these rules to capture everything and then we can refine from there, but I want to make sure there's a governing structure as we start with whatever the new thing is.""",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/la-city-council-committee-wants-scooters-lower-speeds/176389/
Top speed for scooters in LA: 12 miles per hour,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,9,"Top speed for scooters in LA: 12 miles per hour. LA’s list of proposed rules for dockless vehicles keeps growing. Los Angeles officials added a speed limit Wednesday to the growing list of rules the city is considering to regulate dockless scooters. The electric vehicles would not be allowed to travel faster than 12 miles per hour, around the average speed of a beach cruiser bicycle, under the new requirements, which are still a work in progress. Many of the scooters now deployed reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Councilmember Mike Bonin, who chairs the city council’s transportation committee, introduced the new requirement based on concerns that “companies are going to want to compete with each other over who can go fastest.” Bonin said that allowing riders to zip around at faster speeds “poses a safety problem.” The vehicles began proliferating on the Westside earlier this year and have since spread to other parts of the city, including Hollywood and Fairfax. City leaders are considering regulations that would impose safety standards for dockless scooters and bicycles and curtail the number of vehicles that companies can distribute on streets and sidewalks, but it’s taking a while to iron out those rules. So far, the transportation committee has discussed and revised the new rules three different times. Now, a separate council committee will have to sign off on the regulations before they go before the full council. Some city leaders are concerned about how to govern dockless bikes and scooters in the period before the new rules take effect. Last week, Councilmember Paul Koretz proposed a total ban on electric scooters until the regulations are sorted out. Koretz reiterated his concerns about the safety of the vehicles Wednesday. “We’re very fortunate that we haven’t had a devastating skull fracture yet,” Koretz told the other members of the transportation committee. He added that one of his staffers had been “pretty banged up” riding a scooter, and that he had heard of one instance in which a scooter rider challenged a pedestrian to a fight. The committee did not discuss a possible ban Wednesday, but did add a provision to the proposed rules ensuring that companies will have to get temporary permits from the city’s Department of Transportation in order to make bikes and scooters available for riders. Those permits would be revocable and could be issued before the new rules officially go into effect, giving the city more ability to regulate dockless vehicles in the meantime. Bonin also added a small change to the new rules, which would ensure that they apply to any future dockless vehicles that companies may bring to LA’s streets. That way, he said, the city would already have a regulatory framework in place should “dockless mopeds or dockless hover boards” ever arrive.",https://la.curbed.com/2018/8/9/17670998/bird-lime-scooters-how-fast-los-angeles
Must Reads: Fed-up locals are setting electric scooters on fire and burying them at sea,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,10,"Must Reads: Fed-up locals are setting electric scooters on fire and burying them at sea. They’ve been crammed into toilets, tossed off balconies and set on fire. They’ve even been adorned with dangling bags of dog droppings. As cities like Santa Monica and Beverly Hills struggle to control a rapid proliferation of electric pay-per-minute scooters, some residents are taking matters into their own hands and waging a guerrilla war against the devices. These vandals are destroying or desecrating the vehicles in disturbingly imaginative ways, and celebrating their illegal deeds on social media — in full view of authorities and the public. “They throw them everywhere: in the ocean, in the sand, in the trash can,” said Robert Johnson Bey, a Venice Beach maintenance worker who regularly comes across scooter parts on the Venice Beach boardwalk, Speedway and adjoining alleys. “Sunday, I was finding kickstands everywhere,” Bey said. “Looked like they were snapped off.” The vandalism echoes a rash of pellet-gun attacks on so-called Google buses in the Bay Area and appears to be motivated in part by resentment over the increasing presence of tech corporations along the Southern California coast — what is now dubbed Silicon Beach. But unlike the attacks on buses that ferry workers to their Google and Apple offices, the scooter destruction has elicited little sympathy or outrage — to say nothing of criminal investigations. The Los Angeles Police Department’s Pacific Division has received just one report of scooter vandalism that resulted in an arrest, but the case was rejected by the prosecutor. The Santa Monica Police Department said it hasn’t received any such reports. Lt. Michael Soliman, who supervises the LAPD Pacific Division’s Venice Beach detail, said he’s aware of some vandalism — his team has seen scooters left in a pile 10 feet high. But because people aren’t reporting such incidents, it’s not something officers are responding to, he said. “If we have to prioritize the allocation of our time and resources, first and foremost we’re going to prioritize the preservation of life,” Soliman said. “Protection of property comes second.” Hailed as a cheap, clean-energy solution to urban gridlock when they first arrived in Los Angeles a year ago, Bird and Lime scooters now find themselves on the receiving end of a public and bureaucratic backlash — especially on the Westside, where they’ve established a buzzing omnipresence. In Venice, where Bird is headquartered, City Council members voted to cap the number of scooters on city streets while officials craft longer-term regulations. Beverly Hills officials ordered them banned for six months. Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz asked officials last week to take “all available measures” to outlaw the scooters within the city. While most tech entrepreneurs expect some criticism and calls for regulation when they introduce new and potentially disruptive products, they don’t necessarily anticipate the outright destruction of their property. They also don’t expect to see such carnage celebrated and encouraged on social media. Yet mayhem directed at dockless scooters is the order of the day on Instagram’s “Bird Graveyard,” whose contributors relish publishing photos and videos of scooters that have been set aflame, tossed into canals, smeared with feces and snapped into pieces. The account has more than 24,000 followers. One moderator, a Westsider who declined to give his name for fear of prosecution, said that more than 100 videos and photos of scooters being defaced are submitted to the account each day. Only the most outrageous are published. Bird representatives were reluctant to discuss the phenomenon but urged people to report incidents of defacement. “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” Bird spokeswoman Mackenzie Long said in a written statement. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior.” It’s unclear exactly how many scooters are being sabotaged on local streets. Bird declined to say how many of its scooters have been maimed, while a representative from Lime, based in San Mateo, said less than 1% of its scooters have been vandalized nationwide. Natanel Edelson, a mechanic who does repairs for Bird in Venice, said he sees a lot of scooters with cut power cables and smashed brakes. He only fixes a few each week, but said his friends who are also Bird mechanics — all independent contractors making around $15 per repair — fix dozens of scooters a day. When Hassan Galedary of Culver City sees a Bird scooter, a knot in his stomach begins to twist and his teeth clench, he said. The 32-year-old film producer describes the sensation as one of “violent bitterness.” “I hate Birds more than anyone,” Galedary said. “They suck. People who ride them suck.” He loathes the scooters so much that he waged what he calls an “insurgency” against them, tossing the contraptions into trash cans on Abbott Kinney Boulevard and down the Culver City Stairs. He even designed a T-shirt of a chick perched on a scooter being shot in the head. Many of his anti-scooter antics have been featured on the Bird Graveyard account. So where does all this scooter scorn come from? Galedary grew up on the Westside and said he hates how kids there are paying to ride scooters instead of honoring the local traditions of surfing and skateboarding. He hates the traffic accidents they cause — “Bird on Bird,” “Bird on person” and “Bird on car”— and he hates how they can be left anywhere for pedestrians to trip over. “The city is already losing so much culture due to gentrification,” Galedary said. While not everyone is as angry as Galedary, others agree that the sudden influx of scooters has changed the character of the Westside. The scooters’ abrupt arrival in Venice last fall was viewed by some as another example of how the tech industry was encroaching on the community without asking for permission. It didn’t help that Bird founder Travis VanderZanden — a former executive at Uber and Lyft — said the company wouldn’t be happy until there are “more Birds than cars.” “It’s a very urban environment,” said architect Kelly Boston, a longtime Venice resident. “We’re all close together, we need to be respectful of one another’s space, and these make it harder.” The scooters might be affordable, residents say, but they’re left all over the place, blocking sidewalks and tripping up pedestrians. They complain that scooter pilots zip through and around traffic without obeying traffic signals. Tye Donaldson, a Venice barista, has a complicated relationship with the scooters. The 20-year-old loves riding them — they’re “super fun,” she said — and she appreciates them as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation. They’re also affordable: It costs $1 to unlock a scooter and 15 cents per minute to ride one. But Donaldson began to reassess their place in the community after she was hit by a scooter not once, but twice in the same month while running on the Venice Beach bike path. The first time, the teenage rider was driving slowly; Donaldson described the collision as a forceful nudge. She avoided injury by flopping over into the sand. The second time, the scooter was going full speed, about 15 mph. She heard it approaching her from behind and whipped around in time to grab the scooter’s stem to keep it from slamming into her. “I was holding on to this girl’s scooter with all my might,” Donaldson said. “I felt like I was in ‘The Matrix.’” Donaldson thinks speed restrictions should be placed on the scooters in heavily trafficked areas. But she doesn’t want them to disappear. Of course, there are still those who take a harder stance. Manny Torres, a postal carrier in Venice, pushed his mail cart down Innes Place recently and recounted several occasions in which he nearly hit scooters head-on with his truck. The scooter riders, he said, were swerving haphazardly down the narrow side streets of Venice all too often. “I wouldn’t mind if they just went away,” he said. Bird declined to say how much its scooters are worth, saying that information was proprietary. However, similar motorized scooters on Amazon can sell for more than $1,000. Under the law, vandalism of property worth more than $400 is a felony. Yet the risk of arrest appears to offer little deterrent to those bent on scooter destruction. Dan Ariely, professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, said contempt for technology may offer a partial explanation for why people feel inclined to vandalize the scooters, despite the risk. But a likelier reason, Ariely said, is that destroying a scooter owned by a corporation probably doesn’t evoke much guilt within the vandal. “Think about Uber,” Ariely said. “Even if you’re upset with the company, you understand that destroying the car is going to cost the driver a lot of money. “But if you wreck a Bird, no one in particular is getting hurt,” he said. Ariely also compared scooter vandalism to road rage. When something upsets us, he said, it is natural to want to seek revenge, to teach the offending entity a lesson. The presence of images on social media of scooters being damaged may also lead some to view their urge to destroy as reasonable, Ariely said. If people get a sense that scooter vandalism is rampant, just as speeding on the highway is rampant, vandals can still consider themselves “good people,” he said. But oddly enough, it was rampant scooter vandalism that gradually led Galedary, the Culver City Bird cynic, to a change of heart. He said he stopped messing with scooters some months ago when he began feeling increasingly guilty. “As much as I hate them,” he said, “I can’t put bad energy into the world. I don’t even kick them over anymore.” But Galedary hasn’t exactly quit his Bird high jinks cold-turkey. He recently placed a scooter in the middle of Abbot Kinney Boulevard, triggering an immediate snarl of honking cars. He said he wanted people to associate Bird scooters with the quintessential symbol of Los Angeles discontent: a traffic jam.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-scooter-vandalism-20180809-story.html
Bird and Lime scramble to rally fans to save Santa Monica operations,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,13,"Bird and Lime scramble to rally fans to save Santa Monica operations. Bird Scooters suddenly shuttered their operations in Santa Monica Monday afternoon in a bold move to save their business here. The local start-up failed to get the endorsement of a key committee for the City’s official electric scooter pilot program launching this September. After flooding the City with scooters over the summer in an attempt to compete, Lime also failed to win the endorsement. Instead, the official selection committee recommended awarding contracts for Lyft and Jump (which is owned by Uber) to launch their own electric bike and scooter operations here. “This group inexplicably scored companies with no experience ever operating shared e-scooters higher than Bird who invented this model right here in Santa Monica,” a Bird spokesperson wrote in an email to local riders. Both companies planned to rally outside City Hall at 5 p.m. Tuesday as City Council officials show up for their public meeting. Until then, Bird says their scooters will remain inoperable in the city. “Please let city leaders know how much you have come to depend on Bird, and how you would feel if you woke up one day and Bird was gone – because they decided two car-based rideshare corporations should own all of Santa Monica transportation,” Bird said. It’s not clear whether the companies will try to force an item to get on the official agenda Tuesday. Santa Monica’s public information officer said any public comment on the scooter issue will likely take place after midnight when all other business has been concluded. Planning Director David Martin has the actual say on which four companies out of the thirteen that applied will get contracts to operate dockless rideshare services in the city. The City Council approved a pilot program earlier this year that will award contracts to two electric scooter companies and two bike share companies. Each company submitted a detailed plan for how their shared mobility fleets would operate in the city. The selection committee made up of city staffers and a Santa Monica Police Department Lieutenant scored each company on seven categories including experience, operations, compliance and safety. Bird and Lime each performed poorly on the compliance portion of the assessment, which was based on their record with Federal, state and local laws, scoring half as many points on the metric as Lyft and Jump. Bird also scored low on their proposed plans for operations and public education. Lyft scored highest in those areas, coming out the strongest on the assessment. In a post on the website Medium, Lyft’s Co-founders John Zimmer and Logan Green said the Lyft app will soon integrate scooters and bikes, as well as real-time public transportation updates to give customers a variety of options for their commutes. The company has emphasized its commitment to sustainability, encouraging users to carpool through the app, rather than ride alone. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the private and public sectors to work together to make our cities designed for people, not cars,” the co-founders said. “We see the introduction of bikes and scooters to our cities’ shared transit ecosystems as one more step in Lyft’s civic responsibility.” Uber acquired Jump bikes earlier this year, promising to quickly integrate bikes and scooters into the app. The feature debuted in San Francisco in February, and the company said bikes rapidly began replacing car trips, particularly when streets were most congested with cars. While the number of rides booked on the app increased by 15 percent, it was mostly driven by the bikes, as car trips declined ten percent. “The fact that demand for eBikes is currently constrained by limited supply (there are only 250 JUMP bikes in San Francisco) makes this all the more promising,” policy research analyst Santosh Rao wrote in a recent blog post about the data. With names like ‘Drop,’ ‘Gotcha,’ Hopr, Razor, Scoot, Skip and Spin, the application process revealed the sheer number of companies trying to vie for a space in a relatively new and rapidly expanding industry. Leaders in cities across the country have been scrambling to update ordinances that do not address a brand new industry that relies on the ubiquity of their products for market dominance. The report comes as Los Angeles appears poised to ban the scooters until regulations there can be approved and permits issued. Beverly Hills has also enacted a temporary ban on the scooters.",https://www.smdp.com/bird-lime-scramble/168504
Newport council takes dim view of scooters but shies away from ban or new regulations,Daily Pilot,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,15,"Newport council takes dim view of scooters but shies away from ban or new regulations. The Newport Beach City Council is skeptical of Bird and other popular rental services that provide dockless electric scooters and bicycles, but not enough to put them under a moratorium. The council decided Tuesday night to take no action on banning or accommodating the devices, unless city staff proposes a permit. That would indicate a company is willing to work within Newport’s existing rules for business operations and try to keep the devices out of areas where motorized vehicles aren’t allowed, like boardwalks. Any permit would have to be approved by the Planning Commission. Councilwoman Diane Dixon, whose district includes the congested ocean-facing Balboa Peninsula boardwalk, said she has an open mind but wanted a temporary ban. She suggested Newport follow developments in Santa Monica, which will launch a pilot program in September requiring e-scooter companies to pay higher fees and share real-time data, among other conditions. However, Santa Monica did not recommend that Bird or the similar Lime be part of the program, leading the companies to turn off their devices there Tuesday in protest. “I personally don’t believe that we have to say yes to everything,” Dixon said. “We don’t have the room. The boardwalk is at full capacity with even things that are regulated but not enforced,” such as skateboards. The council voted 5-1 on Tuesday to take the wait-and-see approach, with Dixon voting no and Councilman Kevin Muldoon recusing himself because of his work in the wireless telecommunications industry. Bird, one of the more popular motorized scooter-sharing start-ups, deployed a fleet of its scooters around the Balboa Peninsula on July 28. But the city said it did so without notice or permits and ordered the company to remove all its scooters by July 31. Public Works Director Dave Webb said Bird users can legally ride on the street, in bike lanes and on designated bike paths where motorized vehicles are not banned. A dockless device company also could set up a base in another city to avoid needing a specific Newport permit. Brad Sommers, a Newport traffic engineer, said the city got an “immediate and somewhat negative” response from the community during Bird’s brief run, and city staff promptly let the company know it was violating local codes. Residents complained about the scooters being left on sidewalks — one of Bird’s key features is that riders can pick up and leave the pay-per-minute scooters anywhere. Riders find and unlock available scooters by using a mobile app. Some of the scooters drifted into Costa Mesa, Irvine and other Newport neighborhoods besides the Balboa Peninsula, Sommers said. Councilman Jeff Herdman said he was surprised but not upset that the scooters didn’t also roll out on Balboa Island. “There’s a part of me that really resents their whole marketing strategy by dumping and getting a lot of free publicity and free advertising out of the act of having dumped their product on our streets, creating a great deal of havoc … and then forcing the issue,” Herdman said. “It’s not a good way to get started in terms of doing business in our city.” Mayor Pro Tem Will O’Neill said he was hesitant to issue a blanket ban because, in theory, Bird and similar companies could find a way to operate within Newport’s existing rules. “If there is a possibility that a company can adequately comply with our laws, I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to tell them they cannot even try to get a permit,” he said. “If, on the other hand, we decided that we wanted to just straight up ban them and never allow any of this to ever come into our city, we’d have to modify our laws, I think, as part of a moratorium.” He added that if the city wanted to change its laws, that would mean trying to get ahead of an unknown technological curve, and he said he wasn’t keen on that either. Newport resident Don DiCostanzo, who co-founded the Fountain Valley-based Pedego electric bicycle company, said Bird and similar companies shouldn’t get special treatment that he didn’t when he got into the electric bike business 13 years ago. Pedego runs under a more traditional distribution model in which customers pick up and return bikes at a brick-and-mortar shop. “I tried to follow all the rules, and I just want to make sure that other businesses that come here have to follow the same rules that we did,” DiCostanzo said. He said the owner of a Pedego store in Venice recently asked him what he should do about three scooters he found on the sidewalk outside his shop, where he said he isn’t allowed to display his own inventory. DiCostanzo said he should consider them litter and put them in the trash. “They came by a little later with their app and picked them up from the Dumpster,” he said. Newport resident Judy Cole, who lives in the Lido Village area, said there are too many motorized vehicles around town. “I just don’t understand how we can even consider adding more to the mix when we can’t handle the issues that we have today,” Cole said. “It’s a quality-of-life issue for our residents. It’s not the right to be able to do something or to have something. I’m tired of not being able to enjoy our boardwalk and our city streets.” Webb said Lime and Razor, another Bird competitor, have contacted Newport Beach to make arrangements before potentially entering the local market. Dixon said she appreciated that. “That’s how it should be done in any professional, respectable way,” she said.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-newport-scooters-20180815-story.html
Here’s every scooter company that’s trying to deploy in Long Beach ,Press-Telegram,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,17,"Here’s every scooter company that’s trying to deploy in Long Beach. Bird became the third electric scooter company to launch in Long Beach on Thursday, Aug. 16, as part of the city’s 120-day pilot program. companies to apply for the right to a temporary permit. City officials have previously confirmed that Razor, Lime and Bird – all of which have already unleashed their scooters in Long Beach – as well as Skip have all been approved to operate. The final hold-up in Skip’s launch is getting its proposed drop zones approved, Long Beach’s head mobility officer said on Monday, Aug. 13. Permit applications obtained by this news organization indicated the other two companies are San Francisco-based Spin and Los Angeles-based Uscooters. Michelle Mowery, the city’s Mobility and Healthy Living Programs officer, did not respond to a request for comment on the status of their applications. Representatives for Spin were not available for comment. A spokeswoman for Uscooters confirmed the company, which currently only sells scooters, is planning to launch its first scooter share service in Long Beach “in the next few weeks.” The company got the OK from the city this week, spokeswoman Stacy Morris said Friday, Aug. 17. Morris described the company’s product as “the Ferrari of scooters” and said the city’s approval is “great news.” “They do plan on launching in Long Beach, and there are just other requirements they need to meet as part of the program, so they’re working through those” at the moment, she said. Skip’s co-founder and CEO Sanjay Dastoor said in a Friday phone interview that his company is also ironing out the final wrinkles in its own permit process, but he declined to specify a launch date. He said his company has tried to differentiate itself from others by working carefully with cities without rushing to get scooters on the ground. “We actually like the fact that cities are taking a more measured approach in thinking about what serves the community best,” he said. While other companies, like Long Beach competitors Bird and Lime, have faced mounting backlash, Dastoor said, “I wouldn’t just say we’ve attempted to avoid backlash. We’re successfully avoiding it.” He credited that to the company’s willingness to cooperate with cities and residents. As for the specifics that Skip will offer, Dastoor wrote in his permit application to the city that better technology, like ” ‘tip over’ parking detection” and the ongoing development of ‘sidewalk detection,’ which we believe will allow us some day to control speeds on prohibited riding attempts on sidewalks” will push them ahead of their rivals. Once it’s detected that the scooter is on a sidewalk, it would automatically slow down. Dastoor also wrote the company would be “committing to giving up to $150,000” in free rides to incentivize users to return scooters to their designated spots – something Long Beach has been asking the companies to do. Long Beach’s pilot program kicked off in July and will last through the end of October. At that point, the city will determine what the future will hold for those companies’ ability to operate. For now, every company must provide 150 scooters, although they may apply for a second permit, which would allow them to provide 300 in the city. If all six companies get up and running, there will be between 900 and 1,800 scooters across Long Beach. One of the city’s requirements for permitted companies is to disperse at least 20 percent of each fleet into three city zones: the northwest, the northeast and the south. Although the post-October future is unclear, the companies seem to be willing to play by Long Beach’s rules – for now. “We’re hoping (the pilot program) rolls seamlessly into a more longer-term program, but again, we’re willing to work with the city in whatever way is best,” Razor’s COO Danny Simon said when his company launched its service. Dastoor said he doesn’t have any qualms with the city’s process or regulations, but Skip’s application indicated the company may push for at least one policy change if the program is made permanent. “Although Skip respectfully opposes Long Beach’s plan to require an additional sticker requirement to scooters, it will comply for the pilot period,” Dastoor wrote. During Friday’s phone interview, he said that particular objection “is really more of a logistical, operational question.” In his application, he wrote, “We look forward to discussing with Long Beach policymakers why imposing an additional sticker requirement hampers efficient deployment of fleets.”",https://www.presstelegram.com/heres-every-scooter-company-thats-trying-to-deploy-in-long-beach
Could electric scooters fill the Metro bike void in Pasadena? Maybe — but companies need to behave ,Pasadena Star-News,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,22,"Could electric scooters fill the Metro bike void in Pasadena? Maybe — but companies need to behave. When it comes to the dockless scooters and bikes that have proliferated in places like the Westside, Pasadena officials are confident they won’t get caught “flat-footed” — in fact, they might just invite them to the city. The rentals, which users unlock and pay for with their smartphones, are billed by transit advocates and such companies as Bird, LimeBike and Ofo as a cheap and accessible “last-mile” solution — one that can connect people to their final destinations from bus or train stations and reduce reliance on greenhouse gas-spewing cars. But the vehicles’ presence has drawn the ire of residents and officials in cities across the country because they can seemingly pop up on streets overnight without permission. And their dockless nature — they’re secured using a self-contained lock, rather than placed at designated stations — means they can be left anywhere, including in the middle of sidewalks. “A lot of cities were caught flat-footed because they didn’t have regulations in place,” Pasadena City Manager Steve Mermell said at a City Council meeting this week. But not Pasadena. Officials have combed through laws to find at least six ways city code enforcers or police could fight back if a bike or scooter company were to drop their vehicles in Pasadena without permission. Talks, but no details That doesn’t mean dockless bikes in Pasadena are completely off the table, however, especially now that the city is left with no short-term bike rentals. City Transportation Department leaders have met with several companies for preliminary talks about possibly moving forward with some sort of an agreement to operate in Pasadena, city spokeswoman Lisa Derderian said. She declined to provide more information. Lime is among those companies. A representative for Lime said the dockless bike and scooter provider is interested in doing business in Pasadena. “We understand that the city is still in the initial stages of figuring out how they want to approach a dockless program,” Lime’s Courtney Torres said in an email. There’s a definite market in Pasadena for short-term bike rentals after the city pulled out of Metro Bike Share program because of its high cost and relatively low ridership. Usage peaked last August with 10,764 rides. By last month, the number of rides was hovering around only 5,000 or 6,000 per month. Metro began removing the bike stations from Pasadena earlier this week and expects all of them gone by month’s end, an agency spokesman said. Trailing behind others At least one San Gabriel Valley City already has a deal with LimeBike. Monrovia earlier this year launched a partnership with the company as a more financially attractive alternative to Metro’s program, which requires cities pay 65 percent of the operating costs and invest in the installation of old-school bike docking and pay kiosk stations. Pasadena spent $120,000 a month to keep the Metro system running, plus the initial startup costs. Monrovia paid no money to bring LimeBikes to its streets, although $25,000 went to drop-off spots and signs. Sometimes, though, dockless companies are viewed more as uninvited guests. Santa Monica in December filed a criminal complaint against Bird, accusing it of operating without a license and refusing to comply with city citations, including orders to remove scooters from sidewalks. Officials there plan to allow up to four bike and scooter companies to operate in the city under a 16-month pilot program. They say it will allow them to better regulate the companies and enforce laws. Some have had enough West Hollywood and Beverly Hills took a different approach: They both banned dockless scooters last month. Beverly Hills’ ban expires after six months. In addition to concerns about scooters and bikes blocking rights of way, other complaints include the speed of the scooters, which can travel up to 15 mph. There’s also concerns about children using them and users riding them on sidewalks or without helmets — all violations of state law. Los Angeles is looking at capping the speed of scooters at 12 mph and creating a permit requirement for rental companies to do business in the city. Here’s Pasadena’s playbook for dealing with unwelcome scooters and bikes, according to Derderian. City code enforcers could cite companies for obstructing a public way or place, operating without a business license or operating a transportation franchise for use of public ways without a permit. Police could cite scooter riders for violating state Vehicle Code if they ride on sidewalks, without helmets or without a license. The city could remove any bikes or scooters obstructing a public way or place if the owner is not present or unable to remove them.",https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/could-electric-scooters-fill-the-metro-bike-void-in-pasadena-maybe-but-companies-need-to-behave

Pasadena to consider using rental scooters,ABC7,ABC,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,8,23,"Pasadena to consider using rental scooters. Southern California's electric rental scooter are going through a bumpy patch these days. They've been trashed, thrown into the ocean, even burned in places like Santa Monica and Venice. Beverly Hills and West Hollywood have even banned the dockless scooter rentals. The reason? Riders are upsetting pedestrians by using the zippy scooters on sidewalks and littering neighborhoods with the drop-anywhere devices. That is why the city of Pasadena is considering new scooter rules before Lime, Bird or any other electric scooter sharing company begins offering service there. ""New regulations would have to be formed before we move forward,"" said Pasadena spokeswoman Lisa Derderian. ""Whether it be scooters or other dockless bike programs, these are things that we will be looking into."" Derderian said Pasadena is looking for ways to solve the ""last mile"" problem that plagues mass transit -- riders avoiding buses or trains because they don't drop off close enough to their final destinations. The scooter rentals could close that gap. ""We have many public transit stops - be it Metro, Gold Line or buses,"" she said. ""We want to find a way people can get within a few blocks or a few miles to their destination."" Over the past year, Pasadena had been using Metro rental bikes as an option for bus and train commuters, but no longer. Derderian said the bikes were not very popular and the city had been paying more than $100,000 a month for the program, so Pasadena recently ended it. ""The bikes were removed this week,"" Derderian said. ""They weren't being used as much as we thought they would be and because of the cost we did stop our agreement with Metro."" As for scooter sharing, she said before the city makes any decision it will seek community input.",https://abc7.com/4041864/
Los Angeles lawmakers vote to allow scooters—but with limits,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,9,4,"Los Angeles lawmakers vote to allow scooters—but with limits. Companies will be required to remove scooters that block sidewalks. The Los Angeles City Council approved a new set of regulations Tuesday allowing dockless scooter companies to continue operating within the city—with some key limitations. Eventually, each company will be allowed to deploy up to 10,500 dockless scooters and bikes. That number could climb if companies cooperate with transportation officials in ensuring that bikes and scooters aren’t blocking city sidewalks. “The future is here,” Councilmember Joe Buscaino said on Twitter. “Los Angeles must create citywide multimodal infrastructure to reduce traffic, link people to public transit, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” It’s likely that a dozen companies will want to operate in Los Angeles, says Seleta Reynolds, general manager of the city’s transportation department. That’s about how many applied to run in Santa Monica, which just last week put a temporary cap on the number of companies allowed to operate in its borders. Right now, LA’s scooter market is dominated by two companies: Bird and Lime. Reynolds says that Bird representatives estimate that 15,000 of the company’s scooters have been deployed citywide. The new regulations, which also apply to dockless bikes, won’t take effect right away. While city officials finalize the language of the policy, companies will have to apply for temporary permits to operate. During this time, they’ll each be limited to 3,000 vehicles across the city—except in two council districts—District 15 and District Four—where pilot programs are already underway. In these districts, there won’t be a limit on the number of vehicles companies are allowed to distribute for the next four months. Also during this time, councilmembers will have some leeway to determine where riders are or are not allowed to pilot the vehicles. Though the vehicles can be rented and dropped off nearly anywhere, companies can “geofence” restricted parts of the city, preventing riders from traveling in those places. David Graham-Caso, spokesperson for Councilmember Mike Bonin, tells Curbed that LA’s transportation department will begin issuing temporary permits almost immediately. The new rules will also mandate a 15 mile per hour speed limit for electric scooters (Bird scooters already max out at this speed). Companies will also be required to keep vehicles in good working condition and to remove vehicles blocking sidewalks, or risk losing licenses to operate. Companies will have to establish 24-hour hotlines for people to report bikes and scooters that aren’t working or are blocking the public right-of-way. They’ll also have to pay for the right to operate within Los Angeles. Annual permits will cost $20,000, and companies will also have to pay an addition $130 fee per vehicle—though the fees are lower in low-income areas. The bikes and scooters, which can be rented with a smartphone and do not have to be picked up or dropped off at a station or “dock,” have so far existed in a state of legal uncertainty. Last month the City Council's public safety committee rejected a proposed citywide ban on electric scooters that would have remained in place until the new rules take effect. At the same time though, committee chair Mitchell Englander asked transportation officials to send cease and desist letters to dockless companies operating outside of approved pilot areas. The new regulations clear up some of these issues. LA officials, however, continue to spar over local enforcement of statewide rules for riders, including requirements that riders are over the age of 18, wear helmets, and do not operate scooters on sidewalks. “We do know there are safety concerns ... but we can’t regulate stupidity,” said Buscaino. He said the city should continue to encourage riders to “wear a helmet.” But Councilmember Paul Krekorian said a stricter policy was necessary to ensure riders use the vehicles safely. “We plan for stupidity and we try to protect people from their own stupidity,” Krekorian said. “We have to do that with this new technology as well.” A state bill that would remove the helmet requirement was approved by the California legislature last week and now awaits the governor’s signature.",https://la.curbed.com/2018/9/4/17818812/los-angeles-scooters-bird-lime-rules-regulations-vote
"In response to complaints, Bird creates ‘no-go zones’ where its scooters aren’t welcome",Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,9,14,"In response to complaints, Bird creates ‘no-go zones’ where its scooters aren’t welcome. Earlier this year, dozens of Bird scooters appeared on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, parked in front of coffee shops, clustered at bike racks and left leaning against the walls of businesses up and down the Venice neighborhood. When Ron Rosenthal discovered a knot of scooters tucked beneath the picture window of his cobalt-blue bungalow, which houses an antiques store, he called Bird with an explicit request: Keep your scooters off this property. “One call was all it took,” Rosenthal said. The scooters vanished. The antique store, The Perfect Piece, is one of more than 40 locations across Los Angeles County where Bird has asked riders not to park or ride their newly ubiquitous rental scooters. The restricted areas, sometimes called “no-ride zones,” are shown in the Bird app’s interactive map as translucent red shapes that trace city boundaries and property lines. As the scooters have begun to feel less like a fad and more like reality, the zones have spread. Some ask riders to avoid entire cities — including Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, which have passed scooter bans — and some government property, including the infamously congested terminal area of Los Angeles International Airport. Other zones dot Los Angeles like chicken pox, overlaid on tiny bungalows in Santa Monica and apartment buildings in Mid-Wilshire, next to barber shops and bakeries, and along quiet residential streets in the beach cities where Bird launched last year. “If they want to make a profit on city sidewalks, that’s up to them and up to the city,” Rosenthal said. “But they can’t do it on my property.” Rides cost $1, plus 15 cents per minute. Users sign up through the Bird app, connect to Bluetooth, and use the app’s interactive map to find and rent a scooter nearby. The map shows the red zones, too, but doesn’t explain the restrictions unless users click for more details. Creating no-ride areas is “common practice” for Bird, spokeswoman Mackenzie Long said, because the company “works hard to be responsive to requests from our cities and communities.” For Rosenthal, the red zone did make a difference. The scooters never reappeared, but scooters from Lime, Bird’s main competitor, are still appearing on his property despite more than two dozen calls, texts and emails, he said. He has hung a cardboard sign in his front window that reads: “No Lime scooters allowed.” For other neighborhoods and areas, whether the red zones make a difference is less clear. The app doesn’t bar users from parking in no-parking areas, and doesn’t notify riders when they scoot into a no-ride zone. That may soon change. In a 135-page document submitted to the city of Santa Monica in August, Bird Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden said the company is working on technology that could notify riders when they enter a restricted zone by sending a push alert to their smart phone or automatically slowing their scooters. California law prohibits motorized scooters on sidewalks, including the narrow pathways along the Venice canals. Bicycles, skateboards and scooters are also prohibited on the arched pedestrian bridges over the waterways. Earlier this summer, Bird added a red zone there. That hasn’t stopped riders from zipping down pedestrian-only pathways and revving over the arched bridges, trying to go fast enough to catch air on the other side, said Josie Scibetta, president emeritus of the Venice Canals Assn. “I see Birds literally flying in the air, as fast as they can, and the kids are like, ‘Yay!’” Scibetta said. “People aren’t paying attention to the red in the canal area, just as they don’t pay attention to the rules that you have to have a helmet and you have to be 18.” Cedars-Sinai Medical Center banned riders from parking or riding on its property in July after hospital employees watched riders zip in from nearby Beverly Grove and abandon their scooters on the sidewalk. The riders were “creating tripping hazards and obstructing our patients’ pathways, particularly for patients using walkers and wheelchairs,” Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman Sally Stewart said in an email. Burton Chace Park, a smooth expanse of grass near the boat slips in Marina del Rey, has long banned motorized vehicles on the narrow paths. Children and “busloads” of elderly residents walk on those paths, said Carol Baker, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Beaches and Harbors. “It’s basically not safe to have Bird scooters there,” Baker said. “Fortunately, they got it.” Bird sent someone to the park to remind riders to dismount, Baker said. If they hadn’t, she said, the county would have started ticketing. Since August, she said, no problems have been reported. Rather than hire full-time staff members to collect the thousands of scooters left strewn across Los Angeles at night, Bird offers a bounty to anyone who can hunt them down. The company typically pays $5 for every scooter that is collected, charged and returned to a sidewalk by 7 a.m. the next day. The independent contractors who hunt down the scooters and return them to the street receive direction from the company on where to leave them, in areas marked on the app as “drop zones.” Not long after that program began, Ricky Hirschfield noticed extension cords running out the windows of his 1913 apartment building a few blocks from Venice Beach. The cords ran down the shingled building and into the yard, where tenants had plugged in a cluster of Bird scooters. “They were everywhere,” Hirschfield said. “It’s an old property. I’m worried about the building catching fire.” Hirschfield fired off an angry message to Bird and said he never received a response. But something had earned him a label, unique in Los Angeles, in the scooter app: “Property owner request[s] no drop zone on his property.” In other areas, the impetus is less clear. Officials with Venice High School were not aware that Bird had asked users not to park or ride scooters there, and neither the Los Angeles Unified School District nor high school employees were involved in creating the restriction, said Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Sam Gilstrap. “There are a lot of activist organizations in Venice, so it could have been generated just about anywhere,” Gilstrap said. Wheeled vehicles are banned on many LAUSD campuses, but other schools do not have a no-riding or no-parking restriction in the Bird app. Bird bans riders younger than 18, but the scooters are wildly popular with teenagers who use their friends’ and parents’ accounts. Along Grand View Boulevard in Mar Vista, Bird has asked riders not to park or ride past a 98-cent discount store, a bar, a restaurant, a yoga studio and a barbershop. But yoga students frequently ride scooters to class, an instructor said, shaking her head. “They can be a nuisance,” said Miriam Zlotolow, the owner of the shopping area, as she cleared tables after the lunch rush at the Grand View Market. “But I didn’t contact them.” Across the street from CBS Television City on Beverly Boulevard, a pet shop, a music school, a barbershop, a carpet store and a handful of other storefronts are listed as a no-riding zone, to the surprise of the tenants. “Are we really?” said Neal Lester, the owner of Lester’s Carpet, as he looked at flooring samples with a customer from Kansas City. “We haven’t had any issues.” Lester said he manages the building for his father, the owner, and handles issues for the building’s tenants. None had complained, he said. The barbers found the scooters fun. The tailor shrugged. A cashier at the Cake Monkey Bakery pointed to a sandwich board just outside the bubblegum-pink front door. It sits atop a jagged crack in the sidewalk that has tripped up pedestrians in the past, she said — maybe Bird wanted to alert its riders, too? That’s a nice thought, said customer Claudia Barragan, as she left holding a chocolate chip cookie. But if Bird were blocking out areas with damaged sidewalks, “there wouldn’t be many places to ride around here.”",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-red-zones-20180914-story.html
Spurned scooter company files letter of complaint with City Hall,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,9,25,"Spurned scooter company files letter of complaint with City Hall. Legal counsel for a scooter company shut out of Santa Monica’s official pilot program has sent city officials a letter calling Planning Director David Martin’s final decision to select Bird, Lime, Lyft and Jump “arbitrary and capricious.” The letter from the president and general counsel at San Francisco-based Spin said Martin turned “objective criteria on its head” to score Bird and Lime higher in the assessment. “Furthermore, the arbitrary redefining of the criteria was clearly done to ensure that only the companies that rogue-launched in the City would be scored the highest, contradicting the City’s stated preferences as well as the supposed objective nature of the selection process,” said the letter signed by Euwyn Poon. The letter is addressed to Martin and CCed to the entire City Council, City Manager Rick Cole and City Attorney Lane Dilg, according to a copy obtained by the Daily Press. Cole confirmed he received the letter and other city officials recently met with Spin. “While Spin may be disappointed in the result, the Director’s selections were well-reasoned and well within his discretion,” said public information officer Constance Farrell. “As the Director wrote in his memo, ‘the selected companies bring a wide range of local, national and international experience that will contribute to a comprehensive and informative pilot program.’” In August, a selection committee made up of city staffers and a Santa Monica Police Department Lieutenant scored a dozen companies that applied to participate in the official Shared Mobility Pilot Program in seven categories, including compliance and safety. Rideshare giants Lyft and Jump (which is owned by Uber) scored highest. Lime and Bird, which were already operating with permits in Santa Monica at the time, scored poorly. In fact, Bird’s initial application scored near the bottom (tenth out of twelve companies). The selection committee ranked Spin third, with high scores for compliance, public education, and safety. The start-up operates scooter and bike share programs in fourteen cities and prides itself on forming public partnerships before launching. Spin’s team met with several officials including City Manager Rick Cole, Acting Chief Mobility Officer Francie Stefan, and Bike Share Coordinator Kyle Kozar in May and June. The company could have applied for a permit to launch before the pilot, similar to Bird and Lime, but decided not to. “From our perspective, it didn’t make sense for us to commit the resources to launch in the market when we knew this process was about to start. We also knew the city was going through a lot of headaches,” said Brian No, Spin’s head of public policy. No was hopeful Martin would select his company based on the selection committee’s rating. He was shocked when he got the news Bird and Lime were chosen. “We don’t think the process was done in a fair, objective way,” No said, arguing the dramatic differences in scoring show the selection was arbitrary. In a memorandum released earlier this month, David Martin wrote he was aware Bird and Lime had both incurred several hundred thousand dollars in fines, but said they had both recently shown a willingness to work with the city. The Planning Director gave the two companies top scores in every category except compliance, where he docked two out of ten points. Martin valued local experience higher than those in the selection committee. “To exclude such experience going forward would unnecessarily short-change the program by potentially excluding operators who have direct knowledge and experience,” Martin wrote, But Spin’s letter argues his rational arbitrarily redefined the criteria to hurt qualified applicants and “reward specific low-ranked applicants that knowingly broke the law.” The company has not filed a lawsuit at this time. The city ordinance allowing the pilot allows “two shared mobility operator permits.” The City has issued four scooter permits, allowing Lyft and Jump to deploy both e-bikes and scooters. “The ordinance language mandates two in each category, but does not limit to only two in each category,” Farrell said. “I think we have a strong argument to make that if the city is able to make adjustments to the pilot program as it did when it issued a final decision, it should use that same flexibility to allow Spin to participate,” No said. The pilot program began Sept. 17 with 2,000 electric bikes and scooters distributed throughout the city.",https://www.smdp.com/spurned-scooter-company-files-letter-of-complaint-with-city-hall/169549
Another first for scooters in L.A.: a conviction for scooting under the influence,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,9,26,"Another first for scooters in L.A.: a conviction for scooting under the influence. Southern California has seen a series of firsts since motorized rental scooters began flooding streets and sidewalks last year, including the first collision with a driver and the first scooter sent to a watery grave in the Venice canals. On Wednesday, Los Angeles officials reported another: the first conviction for scooting under the influence. City Atty. Mike Feuer said his office had secured a misdemeanor conviction against Nicholas Kauffroath, 28, who was riding a Bird scooter on a sidewalk in West L.A. when he knocked a pedestrian to the ground and scooted away to a nearby apartment building without stopping to render aid. When police officers found Kauffroath, Feuer said, his blood-alcohol level was measured at .279, more than three times the legal limit. Kauffroath pleaded no contest to one count of operating a motorized scooter while under the influence, and one count of hit-and-run, officials said. Kauffroath, who did not return a request for comment, was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $550 fine, Feuer said. He was also ordered to pay restitution to the victim, complete a three-month DUI program, and stay off scooters while drinking. “Drinking while operating a vehicle, a bike — or a scooter — is not only illegal, but can lead to serious injury or worse,” Feuer said in a statement. “This conviction demonstrates our office’s continued effort to enforce our drunk driving laws and make our streets and sidewalks safer.” Los Angeles prosecutes thousands of misdemeanor DUI cases each year, but this is the first involving a motorized scooter, said Feuer spokesman Rob Wilcox. The thousands of Bird and Lime scooters that have appeared in Los Angeles and Santa Monica since last year cost $1 to rent and 15 cents per minute to ride. Riders use the companies’ apps to find scooters nearby, and scan codes on the handlebars to unlock them. Before customers can ride, they are required to confirm that they will not ride while under the influence of alcohol, drugs or medication. California’s laws against operating a vehicle while impaired are most commonly applied to drivers. But the restrictions also apply to motorcycles, bicycles and motorized scooters. As the scooters have become more popular and migrated to more areas of the L.A. basin, police officers say they have anecdotally observed an uptick in collisions between scooter riders, drivers and pedestrians. “They’re becoming more frequent, certainly,” said Det. Connie White of the Los Angeles Police Department’s West Traffic Division. This month, she said, the LAPD created a code that will allow officers to track scooter collisions, similar to how bicycle crashes are tallied. Earlier this month, a 25-year-old man rode a scooter into a LAPD drunk-driving checkpoint in West Los Angeles and failed a field sobriety test. The TMZ write-up of the incident reminded riders that a scooter is a motorized vehicle, adding: “This concludes your Sunday Funday bummer.”",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-scooter-dui-20180926-story.html
Kids love e-scooters—why aren’t they allowed to ride them?,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,9,27,"Kids love e-scooters—why aren’t they allowed to ride them? “E-scooters are a fantastic way for kids to get around... if they’re old enough to work, they should be old enough to operate a scooter” Daniel lives a little over a mile from the middle school in central Los Angeles where he attends eighth grade. To get there, he used to sometimes hitch a ride from a parent driving to work, but most days he found himself making the 20-minute walk. That was up until a few months ago. Now he has a new way to get there in half the time: rentable e-scooters from companies like Bird and Lime. “I used to come late to school, because I always wake up late,” he told Curbed. “Now the Bird gets me here on time.” Daniel is one of three 13-year-olds interviewed by Curbed (their names were changed to protect their identities) who have used e-scooters to get to campus or socialize with friends. The students say the scooters are fun, affordable, and efficient. There’s one major problem. Under California law, scooter riders must be at least 16 and have a driver’s license or permit. E-scooter rental companies operating in LA have an even stricter age requirement: 18 years old. E-scooters have been championed by some local leaders as a solution for alleviating traffic and reducing pollution. Over the last year, they have become increasingly popular in cities for traveling short distances that make up a majority of urban trips. One of the age groups e-scooters could best serve is teenagers, especially those who don’t have access to cars—or who don’t want to get a drivers’ license at all. Most kids are already adept at riding them, and they could use them to get to school or work without relying on a parent, says Sarah Kaufman, associate director of NYU’s Rudin Center for Transportation. “E-scooters are a fantastic way for kids to get around,” she says. “These are kids who grew up using Razor scooters, and now they’re graduating to e-scooters. It’s a better option than saving up for a car... if they’re old enough to work, they should be old enough to operate a scooter.” The rules, which are designed to keep young riders safe, have gone largely unenforced. Experts say there are better ways to protect kids while giving them access to the new technology. Scooter companies require users to agree to terms of service certifying that they are at least 18 years old, and most require users to upload a photo of a driver’s license and scan the barcode on the back. But the uploaded information is not always verified. Two of the 13-year-olds interviewed for this story said their parents had let them borrow their driver’s licenses and credit cards to ride. (Only one student said he knew about the requirement to be 18.) “I read through the agreement, but I didn’t take it seriously,” Javier told Curbed. “I told my parents I was riding it, and they let me.” The students told Curbed that they’ve been able to ride Lime scooters without having to upload a license at all. One student, Brian, said that’s why he continued to ride Lime instead of Bird. In its June application for San Francisco’s scooter pilot, Lime noted that “due to the current political climate,” the company does “not support requiring the scanning of users’ driver’s licenses,” claiming that it will “discourage the immigrant community from using our service.” But in its Santa Monica proposal filed in July, Lime said it would photograph licenses and use a third-party verification system to confirm the rider’s age. A spokesperson from Lime says the app photographs and scans the barcode of the rider’s driver’s license and has riders sign an agreement that they are 18 and over. Over the past few weeks, Curbed tested the validation process for Bird and Lime using an expired California driver’s license and a California non-driving identification card—both of which worked to unlock scooters. State lawmakers have tried to tweak the law around e-scooters. AB 2989, signed into law last week, will no longer require helmets to be worn by scooter riders who are 18 and older, starting January 1. An earlier version of the bill also attempted to create a new vehicle class for e-scooters that wouldn’t have required a driver’s license, and it would have been up to cities to impose tougher standards. The original bill would have been a move in the right direction, says Frances Anderton, host of the KCRW show “DnA: Design and Architecture,” Santa Monica resident, and mom to a teenager. In January, Anderton interviewed teens under 18 who were using Bird scooters to get around, which her own daughter did at one time as well. She says Santa Monica teens who once rode e-scooters are now more hesitant to ride, due to rumors of hefty fines for riding under 18—like the $500 tickets reported in a recent Verge story about underage scooter riders. A city spokesperson says the majority of the 1,100 e-scooter citations handed out in Santa Monica have been for riding without a helmet. “The court sets the fees for all tickets, but we understand that most are around $200,” spokesperson Constance Farrell says. It’s easy to see where there might be confusion about the age requirements—and the consequences for defying them. Even Santa Monica’s website for its scooter pilot program says riders must be 16, which reflects state law but not the e-scooter companies’ rules. To use ride-hailing and other shared mobility companies, 18 is the industry-wide standard. Like rental car companies, scooter companies probably adopt stricter standards for liability reasons, says Jim McPherson, an attorney and consultant specializing in new modes of transportation. “[Riders] have to have the maturity to drive safely but also to enter into a contract,” he says. He believes that for e-scooters, that age is 14, as long as a parent co-signs the contract. It’s not just the ages, but having a license that’s important, says Santa Monica’s mobility director, Francie Stefan. It’s critical for motorized scooter riders to know traffic rules, because they are supposed to share the street with cars, she says. Do kids know to slow down when they approach a speed bump, or what to do when approaching a sidewalk apron? “I think it’s great that kids want to use scooters, but until they understand how streets work, there are other options,” Stefan says, like non-motorized kick scooters. But why should e-scooter riders need to know how to drive a car to operate a motorized scooter? If it’s important for them to know the rules of the road, why not require riders to obtain a scooter permit? Experts like Kaufman and Greg Rodriguez, an attorney who does policy analysis for emerging transportation technologies, say one obvious solution would be to create a new permitting system for scooter riders, similar to cars but separate. “We have all these new innovations coming online, and we’re trying to make them fit into this existing world of cars, and that just doesn’t work,” he says. If California cities truly want to embrace emerging transportation tech, it would mean allowing teens and people who don’t have driver’s licenses to share e-scooters and other options on the horizon—but also dramatically rethinking ways to keep all users of the road safe, says Kaufman. “In Los Angeles, and in frankly every city, we need protected bike lanes that are now becoming bike and scooter lanes, so people can ride safely and also avoid the sidewalks where they might run into someone,” she says. California’s helmet laws were lifted for adults amid a series of reports that scooter injuries are on the rise, including the first confirmed death of a scooter rider in Washington D.C. But putting 16-year-olds behind the wheel of a car is more dangerous, says Kaufman. “If we’re giving kids permission to drive two-ton vehicles, we can’t be concerned about their safety or the safety of others when it comes only to scooters,” she says. “There’s far more damage done by cars than scooters.” Anderton agrees. “I’d say that as a mother whose child gets to Santa Monica High School using various transit options—bicycle, bus, walking, car—I am as nervous of her safety on all of these as I was when she rode e-scooters,” she says. She’d like to see the vehicles reclassified so a drivers’ license is not required, limited to a safe speed, discounted for students, and integrated into Santa Monica’s transportation infrastructure. Most critically in a city notorious for bad traffic, with a particularly paralyzing rush hour, scooters should be folded into school mobility plans, says Anderton. “What a way to lighten car congestion during school dropoff and pickup hours,” she says.",https://la.curbed.com/2018/9/27/17898356/scooters-bird-lime-age-requirement-license
"Lacking an ability to enforce beach scooter ban, city looks to operators for tech fixes",Long Beach Post,,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,10,3,"Lacking an ability to enforce beach scooter ban, city looks to operators for tech fixes. Changes could be coming for electric scooter riders in Long Beach regarding how fast they’re allowed to scoot down the beach bike path, if at all, as the City Council mulls policy changes before the city’s scooter pilot program concludes this month. Scooters, which are governed by the California vehicle code, are currently banned from the beach bike path. City staff said the devices can end up there due to a lack of enforcement and scooters not being explicitly included in prohibited types of travel along the path. The City Council declined to take concrete steps to address the issue Tuesday night, voting instead to defer to one of its subcommittees in the coming weeks. A full report on the pilot program is expected to be presented to the council before the end of the year. Officials could then deliberate on a more permanent policy as to where scooters can go, and how much it will cost to operators to deploy their scooters in the future. As scooter popularity has increased in the city, so too have complaints that scooters have been abandoned in public rights of way and that riders have exhibited unsafe or illegal behavior while riding. Third District Councilwoman Suzie Price brought the issue to the City Council Tuesday night in an attempt to expressly ban scooters from the beach bike path, but the conversation shifted to how the six companies currently part of the pilot program could use technology to “geo-fence” scooters out of certain areas. “Right now they’re not allowed on the beach path,” Price said. “We’ve received a lot of complaints about this and what we hear is, ‘Why can’t you enforce this?’ And the reality is because we don’t have officers standing on the beach path enforcing these rules. But we do have technology.” Last month the Los Angeles Times published an article about business owners requesting to be added to Bird scooter’s “no-go” zones on its app, which are marked by red patches that it requests riders to not park or ride its scooters. Bird has acknowledged that it’s working on technology to alert riders when they enter these zones and possibly automatically slowing the scooters when they do. Bird is one of the scooter operators part of the city’s pilot program. Thomas Lord, general manager of Lime, which also operates in Long Beach, said his company has the capacity to address both of the council’s concerns about how fast people are riding scooters on the bike path and scooters being abandoned there, but cautioned that by turning on those features Lime could be putting itself on uneven ground with competitors. “We definitely have the technology to address both of those,” Lord said. “There are operators that don’t have that technology and in turning that technology on we put ourselves at somewhat of a competitive disadvantage from a consumer experience.” Lord said in Santa Monica Lime limits riders to 8 miles per hour on the beach paths and does not allow riders to start or stop a ride on the beach path. He added that if a rider does leave a scooter they won’t be able to end the ride until it’s in a zone that allows drop offs, meaning that the rider would continue to accrue the 15 cents per minute charge until it was removed from the beach path. The prospect that a financial incentive could keep some riders from leaving their scooters along the beach path seemed to assuage some members of the council. While more changes could be hammered out in the coming weeks with the issue being sent back to committee some are pushing for a measured process in reaching any new policies. Eighth District Councilman Al Austin noted that the beach is one of the city’s great assets, and said he didn’t want to limit access or limit a form of transportation that the city doesn’t fully understand yet. “Whether this thing turns out to be the thing of the future or the thing of today, I can recall two or three years ago that people were lined up and they were concerned over hover boards,” Austin said. “I don’t see anybody riding hover boards anymore. I’d like to see us proceed with caution on this particular item.”",https://lbpost.com/news/beach-path-scooter-ban-long-beach
Huntington Beach moves to ban scooter and bicycle sharing services,Daily Pilot,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,10,16,"Huntington Beach moves to ban scooter and bicycle sharing services. Citing public safety concerns, the city of Huntington Beach is taking steps to ban bicycle and scooter sharing services. The City Council without discussion Monday unanimously approved the first reading of an ordinance to bar shared mobility devices and rental businesses. The measure requires final approval at a future council meeting. Companies such as Lime and Mobike enable customers to unlock and rent scooters or bicycles using a mobile app. In some cases, users can park the devices anywhere and relock them through the app. The business model is similar to the Lyft and Uber car ride services. City officials contend scooters and bicycles pose a threat to public safety by creating traffic and other challenges in streets and alleys and on curbs and sidewalks, according to a city staff report. The ordinance would make it illegal for any operator to provide, place or offer shared mobility devices in any public right of way. People also would not be allowed to ride such scooters or bikes in the city, and the devices could be impounded. Offenders would be fined $100 for a first offense, $200 for a second and $500 for each additional violation within a one-year period. Huntington Beach earlier placed a four-month moratorium on the services. Other coastal communities, such as Newport Beach and Santa Monica, also are grappling with the issue. Sea Dance development wins final approval Applicant Rick Wood of Irvine-based TRI Pointe Homes received final approval for his proposal to build 51 single-family homes on the former Franklin Elementary School site at 14422 Hammon Lane. The City Council unanimously approved amending the site’s land-use designation from semi-public to low-density residential and open space. The city Planning Commission unanimously supported the Sea Dance project in September. Wood’s proposal calls for 51 homes, a 1.3-acre public park, private streets, public utilities and a water quality basin lot. Each unit will have a two-car enclosed garage and a 400-square-foot minimum yard area. It is unclear when construction will begin. Several community members asked the council during the public hearing to vote for the project, saying the developer had agreed to scale it down in response to community feedback. Wood reduced the number of homes to 51 from 53, decreased on-street parking to 70 spaces from 74 and increased the public park to 1.3 acres from 1.15. Councilwoman Lyn Semeta said it was “refreshing” to hear the comments in support of the project and praised the developer for listening to the public. Permit parking to be required for large RVs The council also unanimously gave final approval to an ordinance restricting recreational vehicles more than 22 feet long or 84 inches wide from parking on public streets without a permit. Police Chief Robert Handy has said the ordinance is intended to enhance pedestrian and traffic safety and address parking issues. The ordinance, which goes into effect within 30 days, includes a tiered penalty system of $82 for a first violation, $162 for a second and $246 for a third in one calendar year.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-hb-scooters-20181016-story.html
Santa Monica Installs In-Street E-Scooter Parking Corrals,Streets Blog LA,Streets Blog,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,11,8,"Santa Monica Installs In-Street E-Scooter Parking Corrals. Last week Santa Monica’s City Manager Rick Cole tweeted a photo of the city’s newly installed first in-street e-scooter drop zone. In-street parking corrals have been recommended as a solution for dockless device clutter. Seattle pioneered early dockless parking areas on sidewalks. Santa Monica appears to be the first city to implement in-street corrals for e-scooters and e-bikes. In a statement to Streetsblog, Cole noted that “Santa Monica is committed to overhauling our street network to make our public realm safer, greener, and more attractive.” The beachfront city of Santa Monica has been at the forefront of the proliferation of shared e-scooters. The city is home to Bird, whose e-scooters first appeared in September 2017. Seemingly overnight they became ubiquitous throughout Los Angeles County’s Westside, especially in and around downtown Santa Monica. The city is a popular tourist destination, and e-scooters have seen a lot of tourist use. Some Santa Monicans are critical of the new devices, but people ride them in great numbers. Safe streets advocates have become proponents for the new shared mobility devices. City staff initially proposed significantly reigning in e-scooters, but the city council rejected tight fleet limits when it approved pilot regulations. Santa Monica selected four pilot operators: Bird, Jump, Lime, and Lyft. These private companies operate shared e-scooters and e-bikes, alongside the city’s Breeze bike-share system. In August, the city began installing drop-off zones for scooters, initially on sidewalks. The city’s Mobility Manager Francie Stefan reports that there are currently nineteen sidewalk corrals and four in-street corrals. Her aim is to have roughly 100 corrals by April 2019, about half on sidewalks and half in-street. Sidewalk corrals are easier to install, and generally smaller (some as small as six feet by six feet), so they were the first ones to go in. Other than staff time for siting, design, and installation, Stefan estimates that in-street corral hard costs are about $800 (mostly bollards), and sidewalk corrals $200 (paint.) To date, on-street corrals have not removed parking, instead taking advantage of red-painted curb areas. The city started with drop zones at Metro Expo Line light rail stations, then on main streets. Santa Monica Bike Program Coordinator Kyle Kozar reports that drop zone usage has been mixed, with many riders continuing to leave e-scooters pretty much anywhere. But operators have caught on. After nightly charging, many e-scooters are neatly placed in designated corrals, resulting in them being easier for regular users to find. The city is working with operators to devise ways to encourage drop zone usage. Kozar expects that in-app parking incentives may be required in the future, similar to how Breeze bike-share works. Breeze is a smart-bike system where riders are encouraged to lock up at designated docks, but are allowed to lock Breeze bikes anywhere in the service area. Riders are charged a small fee if they lock up outside an official dock, and receive a small discount for moving undocked bikes into docks. Last spring, a staff report asserted that e-scooters were adversely impacting Breeze bike-share ridership. Kozar reports that overall Breeze rides are down about thirty percent from 2017 to 2018, but that there is still a solid user base taking 4,000-5,000 bike-share trips per week. Stefan notes that shared mobility rules and facilities remain a work in progress. Santa Monica’s sixteen-month pilot kicked off in September, and lessons learned from it will be applied to updated regulations. City Manager Cole emphasizes that Santa Monica is “committed to creating a new model of mobility that gives residents, commuters, and visitors an expanding range of choices for getting around.” He takes pride in Santa Monica “starting the region’s first bike-share” and “birthing the micro-mobility industry.” The in-street dockless device corrals represent another important Santa Monica first.",https://la.streetsblog.org/2018/11/08/santa-monica-installs-in-street-e-scooter-parking-corrals/
"Electric scooters show up in Altadena, East Pasadena — still a no-go in Pasadena ",Pasadena Star-News,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,11,19,"Electric scooters show up in Altadena, East Pasadena — still a no-go in Pasadena. Bird scooters have arrived in the Pasadena area. There’s been a high concentration of the rental scooters for months on the Westside. This weekend, they flocked east — the company dropped off some scooters in unincorporated East Pasadena and Altadena. It may be the closest the scooters have come to Pasadena — but residents shouldn’t expect to be able to ride a Bird within the city limits. “Scooters are still prohibited in the city,” Pasadena spokeswoman Lisa Derderian wrote in an email. “We will impound them if they are left in Pasadena.” Bird appears to be abiding by the city’s wishes: The company has created a “no-ride” zone around the city’s borders, or geofencing, which means users shouldn’t be able to cross the city line, according to company spokeswoman Mackenzie Long. Cities in the Los Angeles area and nationwide have grappled with how to deal with the bikes and scooters that are commonly left on sidewalks which unlock and pay for with their smartphones. They can seemingly pop up overnight — as was the case here — and without official permission. They differ from traditional rental bikes, like those offered by Metro, because they do not need to be placed in a dedicated dock when users are finished. There are different approaches to dealing with the burgeoning technology: Cities like West Hollywood and Beverly Hills have banned the scooters, at least temporarily, while Santa Monica has launched a pilot program to regulate them. Despite the frustration expressed by some cities, dockless vehicles are billed by transit advocates and such companies as Bird, LimeBike and Ofo as a cheap and accessible “last-mile” solution — one that can connect people to their final destinations from bus or train stations and reduce reliance on greenhouse gas-spewing cars. “Bird is now offering a small fleet in Altadena and East Pasadena, and we are thrilled to already see that residents are quickly replacing short car trips for Bird rides,” Long wrote in an email. Pasadena’s next steps Pasadena officials are considering taking a route similar to Santa Monica. City Transportation Department leaders have met with several companies for preliminary talks about possibly moving forward with some sort of an agreement to operate in Pasadena, Derderian said in August. She said Monday officials continue to study the matter and hope to get to “next steps” early next year. “We have had conversations with Pasadena city officials while they wait and see what how other cities respond to e-scooters, and we have not placed any Birds in the city of Pasadena as a sign of our commitment to working closely with them,” Long wrote. “Bird created a no-ride zone around Pasadena city limits, but we hope to soon be able to serve residents in that area as well.” There’s a definite market in Pasadena for short-term bike rentals after the city pulled out of Metro Bike Share program this fall because of its high cost and relatively low ridership. Usage peaked last August with 10,764 rides. By last month, the number of rides was hovering around only 5,000 or 6,000 per month. Staff for county Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents the area, are studying ways to best address dockless rentals in the long-term. “It is our intention to look at it, to talk with the stakeholders and come up with a proposal that works,” spokesman Tony Bell said. Legislation could address safety concerns, like helmet use and riding on sidewalks, Bell said. At the supervisors meeting on Tuesday, Barger plans to ask the board to request reports from county departments about how to best address dockless scooters in unincorporated areas.",https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/bird-migration-electric-scooters-show-up-in-altadena-east-pasadena-still-a-no-go-in-pasadena
"LA County is studying how to find harmony among Bird scooters, cars and pedestrians ",Pasadena Star-News,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,11,26,"LA County is studying how to find harmony among Bird scooters, cars and pedestrians. At least four Los Angeles County departments are studying the best ways to address the recent presence of Bird scooters in unincorporated communities like Altadena as part of a directive from the Board of Supervisors to find harmony among all modes of transportation. The board last week instructed the county Planning, Public Works, Consumer and Business Affairs and Sheriff’s departments to study how cities have addressed rental bikes and electric scooters and to come up with possible ways the county could regulate the vehicles. The supervisors will hear those reports within two months. Other departments may also weigh in. “Placing e-scooters, un-permitted, along sidewalks, in front of businesses, and near parking causes not only a potential blight issue, but also a potential public safety issue,” the supervisors’ directive reads. “We must seek answers,” it says, “as to how to effectively regulate these technologies so they can be compatibly used with other motor and non-motorized uses. We must work with these new technologies to ensure communities have input on where these mobile businesses will be located and how they interface with their neighborhoods.” The move came just days after Bird dropped off some of its electric scooters in Altadena and East Pasadena.Those communities are unincorporated areas governed directly by the Board of Supervisors and represented by Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who made the motion to seek the reports. It was the first time the board had considered how to deal with the vehicles — which appeared seemingly overnight and without official permission — despite the very public struggles in local governments on the Westside. “I guess the model for this company is better to ask for forgiveness than permission,” Barger said. Scooters differ from traditional rental bikes, such as those offered by Metro, because they do not need to be placed in a dedicated dock and are unlocked by a user’s smartphone. There are different approaches to dealing with the burgeoning technology: Cities like West Hollywood and Beverly Hills have banned the scooters, at least temporarily, while Santa Monica has launched a pilot program to regulate them — but only after months of frustration. Despite the angst expressed by some cities, dockless vehicles are billed by transit advocates and such companies as Bird, LimeBike and Ofo as a cheap and accessible “last-mile” solution — one that can connect people to their final destinations from bus or train stations while reducing reliance on greenhouse gas-spewing cars. Meanwhile, Pasadena is taking a proactive approach. Officials there are studying how they might welcome rentals to the city, and Bird seems willing to play nice. The company created a “no-ride” zone around the city limits, which means users shouldn’t be able to cross into Pasadena. Potential regulations from the Board of Supervisors could also affect densely populated or busy parts of L.A. County, including East Los Angeles, South Whittier, West Whittier and many smaller communities in the San Gabriel Valley.",https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/la-county-is-studying-how-to-find-harmony-among-bird-scooters-cars-and-pedestrians
Uber Wants To Be The Uber Of Scooters — And They'll Be All Over LA Sidewalks Soon,LAist,Gothamist,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,11,26,"Uber Wants To Be The Uber Of Scooters — And They'll Be All Over LA Sidewalks Soon. More scooters are coming. The city of Los Angeles has accepted applications from seven electric scooter and bicycle companies and has just started granting provisional permits for them to operate within L.A. The city is authorizing Bird, Lime, Razor, Lyft, Uber and a handful of other companies to roll out 3,000 dockless electric scooters apiece, according to Marcel Porras, chief sustainability officer for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Many of those scooters are expected to show up in L.A. over the holidays. And by next year, their numbers could increase — to 10,500 vehicles per company. Uber was the first company to get one of the new city permits. Earlier this month, the company expanded its Jump electric scooter and e-bicycle program from Santa Monica, where it's been operating since Oct. 1, to the Sawtelle, Mar Vista and Palms neighborhoods. Soon, it will push them further into L.A., including downtown, the east side and other, as yet undecided places based on existing Uber data. To figure out where the electric bikes and scooters will be placed throughout the city, Uber is also looking at areas where traffic congestion is bad and where bicycle infrastructure already exists. ""This expansion is part of our plan to bring multimodal transportation into our app to tackle personal car ownership,"" said Megan Prichard, general manager for Uber's Jump brand electric bikes and scooters in Southern California. ""We think the more options you can provide out there for Angelenos, the easier you make it for them to cheat on their car,"" Porras said. Scooters have become a hot-button issue in cities across the U.S. as local governments scramble to catch up with regulation and promote them as a way to increase mobility in congested streets. Many residents and business owners have been critical of the zippy two-wheelers, citing unsafe riding, disregard for traffic laws and irresponsible parking. Santa Monica and Long Beach have already started pilot programs to see how residents and commuters there will use the devices. But not all cities have grabbed the handle bars. Both Beverly Hills and West Hollywood voted to ban scooters from cruising their streets (well, more likely sidewalks). ",https://laist.com/2018/11/26/uber_scooters_e-bikes_in_la.php
E-scooters have arrived in the San Fernando Valley. Will they sink or scoot? ,Los Angeles Daily News,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,12,19,"E-scooters have arrived in the San Fernando Valley. Will they sink or scoot? Companies like Lime, Razor and Bird have landed in the Valley, with their highly visible scooters in North Hollywood, Warner Center and Ventura Boulevard. Like ducks in a row, hundreds of dockless electric scooters have arrived on Valley streets in the past two weeks, sitting pretty in waiting for new riders. They are predominately on Ventura and Reseda boulevard, near the North Hollywood Metro station and around the Woodland Hills Warner Center. As those eager for traffic-free, eco-friendly and relatively inexpensive transport download apps and go for a spin, local businesses and law enforcement officials anticipate a gust of traffic and safety issues. The exact number of scooters in the San Fernando Valley area is unclear, but most belong to companies Lime and Razor. Bird, the first and largest of the companies, has yet to officially enter the Valley market. Uber’s JUMP scooters have also received a permit to deploy in the area. Bird e-scooters first arrived unannounced to fierce debate more than a year ago in San Francisco and Los Angeles, mostly in Santa Monica and Venice, where they have become popular on city streets for locals and tourists alike. Since then the mode of transport has skyrocketed to ubiquity in cities around the country. Some cities like Beverly Hills have temporarily banned electric scooters to develop regulations prior to their deployment. While each company’s scooter has a different color and design, they each operate along similar lines. Prospective users download an app and present ID to prove they are 18 years of age, then find a scooter using GPS and unlock it with a code. Battery life on each scooter varies, but locals hired to charge the scooters regularly pick up a batch from the street overnight and drop them off with full charge early in the morning. To do the charging, Lime said it plans to hire per-gig local workers called “juicers”. Such “micro-transit” companies, whose fleets often includes e-bikes, say they are aiming to appeal to consumers looking to supplement public transit or traverse short distances in a more green way than jumping in their car. In its annual report, Lime reported a total of 35,000 riders in Los Angeles last year, with 40 percent of them using the scooter to replace a trip by car. But will “micro-transit” vehicles like the scooter really tempt Valley-dwellers to cheat on their beloved cars? Leaders of the business community like David Phelps, President & CEO of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce isn’t sure. After all, the San Fernando Valley is a symbol for automobile-centered life. Phelps is confident, however, in his concern about shoddy scooter parking. E-scooter riders have been known to leave the vehicles indiscriminately strewn on sidewalks and other public spaces, an issue discussed at length by local community leaders like the Sherman Oaks Neighborhood Council. “What kind of fail-safes are going to be put in place so that scooters aren’t just laid down anywhere, that there will be regulations for parking with the onus on the user,” he asked. In an onboarding tutorial, riders are asked to park scooters off to the side of a sidewalk or in a specific designated parking zone, but some simply don’t follow the guidelines. To address the issue, Santa Monica has installed at least one in-street e-scooter drop zone. Manager of Marmalade Cafe on Ventura Boulevard Daniel Worten said he has been finding himself moving scooters from outside his restaurant. “I’m all for everything in moderation, but if I do see them here in front of the business it’s a problem,” he said. “You know we have older people walking around, they shouldn’t have to jump hurdles to get someplace,” he added, pointing to the cafe’s open-air seating area jutting out onto the sidewalk. LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman of the Valley Traffic Division said he’s aiming to work together with scooter companies to tackle parking enforcement, but is primarily thinking about safety. “Our main concern with scooters is public safety, both for the motoring public and pedestrian public. These present a new challenge for anyone who’s commuting because quite frankly, they’re not that visible. Riders don’t realize the danger they put themselves in,” he said. Alex Behlendorf, 20, was riding along a Ventura Boulevard sidewalk on Monday to grab a Chipotle burrito for lunch during a workday. He’s apathetic about wearing a helmet, lives at home with his folks and doesn’t have a car. But he is having a good time, even though he has to maneuver around pedestrians for lack of bike lanes. “I think people my age will like them,” he said. “Whoever isn’t using them yet just hasn’t realized how fun they are.”",https://www.dailynews.com/e-scooters-have-arrived-in-the-san-fernando-valley-will-they-sink-or-scoot
Bird scooter firm settles legal fight with Santa Monica,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2018,22,15,"Bird scooter firm settles legal fight with Santa Monica. The startup that placed electric scooters around Santa Monica for riders to share has reached a settlement with the city over allegations that it failed to secure businesses licenses and vendor permits. The scooters, known as Birds, began to mysteriously show up around Santa Monica in September. Since then, residents and visitors, intrigued by the sight of the black scooters resting on sidewalks or in front of businesses throughout the city, have been using Birds as alternatives to cars, buses and bikes. According to a statement released Tuesday from the Santa Monica city manager’s office, Bird Rides Inc. pleaded no contest and agreed to pay more than $300,000 in fines and secure proper business licenses. The agreement also requires the company to run a weeklong public safety campaign on public buses. Bird Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden, a former Lyft and Uber executive, created the company after moving to Santa Monica from the Bay Area. To operate the scooters, riders have be at least 18, wear a helmet and stay off sidewalks. Eligible users can download an app and pay $1 plus 15 cents a minute to ride them at speeds up to 15 mph. In addition to having safety concerns, Santa Monica officials grew frustrated at Bird’s refusal to obtain permits. Last December, the Santa Monica city attorney’s office filed a nine-count misdemeanor criminal complaint against Bird and VanderZanden. The complaint alleged that Bird began operating its scooters without city approval and that it ignored citations asking the company to obtain proper licenses and remove the scooters from sidewalks. Deputy City Atty. Eda Suh said in a statement that the settlement shows Bird failed to comply with Santa Monica’s business licensing requirements. “Bringing this new business into compliance with local law achieves a fair and positive outcome for the people of Santa Monica,” Suh said. Bird spokesman Marcus Reese said that under the settlement, the city agreed to dismiss the nine misdemeanor counts. “We are pleased that Bird and the city of Santa Monica were able to work out our differences regarding licensure,” Reese said. “Bird now starts fresh with the city, and we look forward to continuing to provide a safe, environmentally friendly transportation solution to the people of Santa Monica.” City officials said scooters will be available to residents and others who are eligible to ride them.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bird-scooters-20180215-story.html
"E-scooters, dockless bicycles gaining foothold in Southern California as LA County drops orders to remove them ",San Gabriel Valley Tribune,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,1,15,"E-scooters, dockless bicycles gaining foothold in Southern California as LA County drops orders to remove them. Pilot programs are springing up. Like Uber and Lyft before them, the latest Silicon Valley startups also showed up uninvited, dropping electric scooters, battery-powered bicycles and other dockless, micro-mobile rentals onto streets and sidewalks of Southern California. The guerrilla marketing strategy aimed at busting the monopoly of the single-passenger car created multiple battlefronts in today’s “Scooter Wars,” sending some cities to the courts claiming they are a nuisance and an eyesore, and others writing regulations that keep them off the sidewalks and target public safety and aesthetics. While some, such as Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, sent in law enforcement and confiscated the scooters, banning them entirely, others, like Santa Ana and the county of Los Angeles have put away the stick and opened up a dialogue of diplomacy. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to direct staff to draw up regulations for all dockless e-scooters and bicycles using the public right-of-way by early March. One of the reasons why the board began negotiating with Bird, a $2-billion company operating in 100 cities, was simple: It would lose in court. “We originally had in there ‘cease and desist’ but it was language we couldn’t uphold. We don’t have the legal ability,” Supervisor Kathryn Barger said. Scooter wars Bird, and also Lime — the two most prolific dockless-scooter-and-bicycle-rental companies — have a foot in the door and a seat at the negotiating table in numerous municipalities and county governments. In short, they may be winning the scooter wars. Earlier this year, while Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach each issued moratoriums on dockless bike and scooter rentals, the city of Redondo Beach did not. Even though tensions rose and Bird eventually removed about 300 scooters dropped without permits, Redondo is still willing to consider a program with Bird. The strategy worked in Santa Monica and Los Angeles. They found scooters on their streets without permits, yet eventually created pilot programs. Santa Ana is allowing Bird to scatter scooters in town, in exchange for data on where riders picked up the scooters and where they dropped them off. This can help planners design future micro-mobility lanes or even additional bus stops. Scooter companies typically offer a smartphone app that can be used to locate vehicles and pay to borrow them. The electric scooters are usually placed early in the day at convenient locations and then collected at night for recharging. Likewise, Bird tussled with city of Pomona by placing scooters on city streets without permits. “That is how they introduce themselves,” said Deputy City Manager Mark Gluba. After convincing them to remove them, the two sides sat down to talk, he said. Pomona is working on an ordinance to allow dockless scooters and bicycles. It will go before the City Council in a few weeks, he said. “Their strategy is it is easier to seek forgiveness than ask permission,” said Denny Zane, executive director of Move LA, a nonprofit that works on solutions to transit issues, air pollution and climate change. Zane said cities must develop regulations for dockless e-scooters and bicycles. Otherwise, they can end up sprawled on sidewalks, blocking wheelchair access or causing accidents. ” I almost got run over on a sidewalk by a girl on a scooter. She was on the sidewalk,” said Zane, a former mayor of Santa Monica. Environmental benefits Zane, and many others who study mass transit, see electric scooters as positive replacements for automobiles, which produce 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Those riding electric scooters may be forgoing cars for a short trip to the market, to attend class or meet a friend for dinner. Barger said she believes the e-scooters in unincorporated areas of Altadena and East Pasadena were purposely placed near the Gold Line light-rail stations and bus stops along Rosemead Boulevard, Huntington Drive, Lake Avenue and San Gabriel Boulevard. She said scooters and dockless bike rentals could become a good option for people to reach impacted parking lots at Gold Line stations in Irwindale, East Pasadena, Arcadia and Monrovia. “As a member of the (LA Metro board), we have a responsibility to look at solving the first-mile, last-mile problem,” Barger said. “We are trying to get people out of their cars.”",https://www.sgvtribune.com/e-scooters-dockless-bicycles-gaining-foothold-in-southern-california-as-la-county-drops-orders-to-remove-them
Scooters took over Venice and Santa Monica. L.A. County has a different plan,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,1,21,"Scooters took over Venice and Santa Monica. L.A. County has a different plan. The flocks of electric scooters appeared one night late last year in Altadena and East Pasadena, surprising locals who found them perched, without warning, on sidewalks along two busy retail corridors. “I came to work, opened the store — and they were there,” said Paul Netherton, who manages the Full Circle thrift shop on Lake Avenue in Altadena. “I had no idea, and I had a lot of customers asking about them.” He and others soon learned that local start-up Bird — whose sleek, black scooters have sparked both wonder and rage in Venice, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and other communities — had decided to expand its nest to a new spot: unincorporated Los Angeles County. It didn’t take long for county leaders to notice. The Board of Supervisors moved last week to adopt what amounts to voluntary limits on the scooters, with companies agreeing to reduce their operations in unincorporated areas, while the county develops regulations. The decision was an effort to head off the kind of confusion and frustration — for regulators, riders, business owners and residents alike — that have beset other communities as the industry has expanded. In 2017, for example, Santa Monica-based Bird flooded its hometown with scooters, prompting the city to respond with an emergency ordinance and pilot program last year that helped control their spread. The city of Beverly Hills also impounded scooters after it, too, was surprised by the rapid deployment of them, prompting a legal fight. Bird and Lime, another operator, have declined to comment on exactly where and how many scooters they’ve deployed. They also have declined to give a tally of rides. But a Times review of data used in their smartphone applications offers a snapshot of how the companies have expanded from Westside neighborhoods into Los Angeles and increasingly into unincorporated areas, home to more than 1 million people. That snapshot shows that the scooters that prompted the county’s regulatory effort accounted for only a small fraction of the thousands deployed across the region. The Times reviewed details in the Bird app from Jan. 8 to Jan. 11 to count the number of unique scooters in the county. The tally is an estimate based on the last known location of each scooter. The Times developed a similar snapshot for Lime based on data sent to that company’s app from Jan. 1 to Jan. 4. The data show that only about 5% of available Bird scooters were in the unincorporated areas controlled by Los Angeles County. Roughly 2% of Lime scooters were in those areas, according to the analysis, which plotted the known locations using mapping software and totaled them within political boundaries provided by local governments. Bird and Lime declined to comment on the data and cautioned that the figures could be inaccurate because their scooters are constantly in motion, as riders move them around the county, and as some get taken in for service or for charging. “It’s small,” said Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, referring to the companies’ footprints inside the unincorporated areas. Her district includes the neighborhoods that prompted the county’s decision to regulate the devices. “We should have something in play in the unincorporated areas,” she said. “It is going to impact those people who are using them, and they are being used.” In addition to operating rules, Barger’s plan also calls for a consumer-focused website with information about how to operate the scooters safely and in compliance with whatever regulations the county ultimately crafts. The industry’s rapid expansion has prompted complaints about haphazard parking and dangers to pedestrians and motorists. There also have been concerns about the safety of riders, who zip along on streets, bike lanes and sidewalks — and occasionally get involved in crashes. The county’s action comes several months after the city of Los Angeles unanimously approved its own rules in response to the scooters’ rapid deployment throughout its territory. Many of the devices remain largely clustered in Westside communities, and many cities within Los Angeles County have worked to craft their own regulations. Long Beach, for example, capped the number of scooters that companies could deploy. It also required them to redistribute the devices to authorized zones each morning, in an effort to put them where riders are most likely to need them. The public reaction to the scooters’ appearance in Long Beach has been mixed, said Michelle Mowery, the mobility and healthy living programs officer with the city’s Department of Public Works. Some residents enjoy the freedom to scoot around, while others object to their presence on sidewalks or operation on sidewalks, which violates the law. Limits on their deployment, however, have softened the disruption, she said. “It gave the public a chance to get used to them,” Mowery said, noting the companies have largely complied with the rules, though the city still occasionally impounds scooters that get discarded outside approved zones. According to The Times’ data analysis, the largest concentration in the county’s unincorporated areas is in Marina del Rey, where regulators have already been working with Bird and Lime, and in Altadena and East Pasadena. Scores of scooters operated by Bird — which now operates across the nation and in countries around the world — showed up in those neighborhoods, along Lake Avenue and South Rosemead Boulevard, respectively, and prompted similar reactions to those in Long Beach, business owners said. The number of Bird scooters in the area has since decreased as the company and the county began to cooperate as regulations are written, or as riders moved them, the data show. The novelty began to wear off over time, as examples of riders discarding them on sidewalks increased and confusion about proper procedures remained. “I don’t understand what the rules and regulations are, when it’s OK for me to move them, who’s responsible for keeping them neat, orderly and out of the pedestrian” right-of-way, said Netherton, the thrift store manager. “There’s just uncertainty and a little bit of annoyance.” That’s precisely what the county hopes to address with rules that ultimately could allow the companies to continue to expand in other unincorporated areas, particularly around transit corridors. “It’s a great thing if it helps people to get around,” said Debbie Rabalais, who manages Vista Paint in East Pasadena, adding that she hopes riders wear helmets and observe traffic laws. “It shouldn’t be any different than anybody else.”",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-county-scooter-rules-20190121-story.html
"Electric scooters have yet to officially debut in Glendale, but that may change come spring",Glendale News-Press,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,2,4,"Electric scooters have yet to officially debut in Glendale, but that may change come spring. It will be months before the Glendale City Council is expected to take up the debate about whether or not to allow electric scooters in the city, but it hasn’t stopped the efforts of at least one resident calling for their outright ban. Tony Passarella was handing out fliers on Tuesday in the Pacific Community Center’s auditorium, where the Glendale City Council held a special “City Council in Your Neighborhood” meeting. At the top of the flier was an illustration of a scooter covered by the international “no” symbol. The council meeting was only informational, meaning no action was taken, and nothing related to electric scooters was on the agenda, save for a general traffic safety presentation by the Glendale Police Department. However, it didn’t stop Passarella from speaking out on the issue during the public-comment portion of the meeting, criticizing companies like Bird and Lime for pouring “hundreds of millions of dollars” into making electric scooters appear as an environmentally friendly alternative to driving. “These dockless scooters … are basically a sale job, a con job by Silicon Valley,” he said. “Micro-mobility, last mile … I mean, you can’t walk a mile? It’s really nonsense as far as I’m concerned.” He also said allowing the companies to operate would see sidewalks in Glendale littered with scooters, causing a potential hazard for people in wheelchairs or who are blind. Electric or dockless scooters have started being used all across Southern California, from Santa Monica to San Diego and even parts of unincorporated Los Angeles County. The only requirements to ride scooters are a smartphone and credit card. The appearance of scooters has given rise to safety concerns for both pedestrians and riders. Cities are left figuring out how to respond to scooters blocking sidewalks and driveways as well as riders zipping through pedestrians and traffic at speeds up to 15 mph — often without a helmet. Cities like Beverly Hills and West Hollywood instituted bans, while some companies, like Bird, created “no-ride zones,” where its scooters are prohibited. Los Angeles even limited the number of scooters that can be placed in the city as a stop-gap solution last year, while leaders figured out a more long-term option. Electric scooters have yet to be officially deployed in Glendale, although that has not stopped riders from bringing them in from neighboring locales. Dan Bell, a Glendale spokesman, said it’s premature to talk about scooters because city staff members are still working on a request for proposal, where companies can submit their plans for how the vehicles would be deployed locally. The issue is not expected to go before the City Council until sometime this spring. The council previously brought up scooters during a Dec. 18 special meeting, where the request originated. The meeting saw the discussion of a one-year pilot program that would cap the number of scooters in the city at 1,000 and establish operating hours for them. The pilot program would also look at the possible establishment of designated scooter parking spots and outline a boundary for where they would be allowed to operate within the city.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/news/tn-gnp-me-electric-scooters-glendale-20190201-story.html
Scooter Mechanic Says He Was Fired Partly For Expressing Safety Concerns,NBC Los Angeles,NBC,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,2,4,"Scooter Mechanic Says He Was Fired Partly For Expressing Safety Concerns. A former mechanic and charger for an electric scooter share company is suing his ex-employer, alleging he was fired in 2018 in part because he expressed concern that safety issues with the scooters were putting the public at risk. Matt Fisher's Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit alleges wrongful termination, retaliation and defamation by Santa Monica-based Bird Rides Inc. and workforce management company Target CW. He seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. He alleges he has been blacklisted from the electric scooter industry. A representative for Bird Rides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sudden rise of scooter startups has provided an alternative form of transportation and Bird, one of the biggest of the scooter startups, said in October that it had surpassed 10 million rides since launching in 2017. But safety issues have arisen given reports that some people have been injured while riding the scooters. Fisher's suit states he was hired as a Bird charger and mechanic in February 2017 and by November 2018 was dubbed the top employee in terms of the number of scooters scanned, reported and fixed. He was later given a field operations associate position and assigned to run technical and mechanical tests on scooters, the suit states. Also in November 2018, a Bird operations specialist issued a memo on the Slack.com messaging service that Bird scooters with missing screws, loose necks and handlebars, missing grips, broken reflectors and other problems were considered ""not damaged"" and safe for public use, the suit states. Fisher responded via Slack.com, ""It's hard to watch this neglect. I apologize if I'm out of place here, but being honest is what I'm about."" The operations specialist replied to Fisher's statement by saying, ""This is what we were told by upper management, we are still making adjustments and figuring things out,"" the suit states. Fisher in turn said, ""I'm not going to ignore the damages. I'm not going to put people's lives at risk,"" the suit states. Fisher was later brought into a meeting with management and told that he needed to stop complaining about the scooters on Slack.com, his suit states. ""This is upsetting people,"" Fisher was told, his lawsuit alleges. ""Other people are not supposed to know about this."" The city of Santa Monica code requires that each electric scooter be safe, be highly durable and have durable brakes, the suit states. Fisher saw ""broken-down devices laid across the sidewalk, preventing and obstructing traffic,"" according to the suit, which includes copies of photos of his allegations. Fisher says he received an email from Target CW on Dec. 3 stating, ""We were informed that your engagement with Bird has ended."" Fisher ""has since been blacklisted from the scooter industry,"" according to his suit, which further states he was not hired at a competing scooter company after he was forced to explain why he was fired by Bird and after the publication of a news report in which the plaintiff was interviewed about Bird scooters. Fisher was told by the prospective employer that he had ""ruined his career"" and ""could no longer be hired,"" his suit states.",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/scooter-mechanic-says-he-was-fired-partly-for-expressing-safety-concerns/6221/

""We launched in LA just last week,"" said Ariella Steinhorn, a spokeswoman for Spin. She said they have 1,000 scooters now, but will eventually ramp up to 10,000 allowed by the city's year-long permit. All operators will have the option to add to their fleet, if they branch out to low-income communities. And the city says residents will soon be able to report improperly parked and broken-down scooters through MyLA311. Scooter operators will have two hours during a certain period of the day to pick them up. This service is covered by the permit fees from each operator, the DOT adds. ""Having people on the ground at all times who are properly trained to be setting them up in the right way and also taking them off the streets if they are damaged is really important,"" Steinhorn said about Spin's plan to have employees checking on the ground. Earlier this week, the NBC4 I-Team reported the unique technology that will track and keep tabs on scooters across the city. Operators must share their data with the city to get a permit, officials said. The city's technology will also monitor any devices parked in one location for more than five days. They will be removed at the operator expense. NBC4 asked about the city's updated plan: Bird's full statement: ""Bird is proud of serve Angelenos with our environmentally friendly option, and we do so per the rules the City of LA has outlined for shared e-scooters in the city.

Anyone hoping to beat the traffic in and out of Dodger Stadium this season by riding an electric scooter may have to come up with a new plan, if Los Angeles City Councilman Gil Cedillo succeeds in getting the devices banned in his district during an upcoming one-year pilot program. Although the makers of the devices say they help to ease traffic, reduce air pollution and offer first- and last-mile transportation solutions, they are also connected to a number of health and safety concerns, including an increased number of people being injured, and being haphazardly parked along sidewalks and parkways, according to Cedillo. He introduced a motion Friday asking the council to exempt the entire First Council District, which includes Chinatown, Highland Park, Westlake and Elysian Park where the stadium is located, from the pilot program. The City Council last September gave the green light to limited growth of dockless electric scooters in the city through a 120-day conditional use permit, followed by the one-year pilot. According to a report from the Department of Transportation, the city issued conditional permits to eight companies, which were each limited to 3,000 devices. Six of the eight companies deployed scooters, while one deployed 2,000 scooters and 1,000 dockless bikes, and one deployed 3,000 bikes. The department closed the application window for the one-year pilot on February, and the earliest LADOT will issue permits is Monday, according to the report. As part of the one-year permit, operators will be allowed to deploy up to 3,000 vehicles citywide, an additional 2,500 vehicles in disadvantaged communities, and an additional 5,000 vehicles in disadvantages communities within the San Fernando Valley for a total possible fleet size of up to 10,500 vehicles per operator. Three different City Council districts had a full or partial ban on the devices during the conditional permit period. Both Council District 12 in the northwest San Fernando Valley and Council District 13, which includes Los Feliz, Silver Lake and Echo Park, had a full ban, while the downtown portion of Council District 14 also had a ban. Fredy Ceja, a spokesman for Cedillo, said no other City Council member as of yet has requested a ban during the upcoming pilot. Councilman Paul Koretz, who has raised concerns about the safety of the devices, was the lone dissenter when the council approved the program in September, but his Westside district was not included on the banned areas during the conditional permit period. “Making it legal doesn’t make it safe. I still doubt whether these can operate appropriately,” Koretz said before the September vote. The dockless Lime and Bird scooters have proliferated in Westside communities over the last year, leaving local governments scrambling with how to regulate them. The scooters work through a phone app that allows people to find and unlock the devices and drop them off anywhere they are allowed, with no docking station or kiosk required. The new L.A. regulations require companies to equip the scooters with a minimum 48-point font warning against riding on sidewalks. Companies also must maintain a 24-hour hotline and respond to improperly parked or inoperable devices within two hours, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.",https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/03/01/dockless-scooters-around-dodger-stadium/
LA councilmember wants to ban scooters from his entire district—including Dodger Stadium,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,3,4,"LA councilmember wants to ban scooters from his entire district—including Dodger Stadium. Also Highland Park and Echo Park. With more dockless scooters and bicycles set to hit LA’s streets as soon as next week, City Councilmember Gil Cedillo is seeking to ban the devices from the neighborhoods he represents. Those communities include Highland Park, Westlake, Chinatown, and Echo Park. At the center of the district is Dodger Stadium, where streets and sidewalks become thick with vehicle and foot traffic on game days. Cedillo introduced a motion Friday asking the city’s transportation department not to issue permits for dockless vehicles in these areas, citing concerns about safety and sidewalk access. In an emailed statement, Cedillo spokesperson Fredy Ceja says that the district “has some of the densest areas in the city, with limited sidewalk space.” He says council staff have fielded “numerous calls” from residents about issues with scooters. “We do not oppose the use of scooters, we are simply asking for more time to determine if they are appropriate for our district,” Ceja says. Since September, when the City Council approved rules regulating private bike and scooter companies, the transportation department has given eight companies short-term approval to deploy a combined 24,000 bikes and scooters across the city. The transportation department will begin issuing longer 12-month permits starting March 15. Under those permits, vehicle providers will be allowed to distribute between 3,000 and 10,500 bikes and scooters on LA’s streets, depending on which neighborhoods they deploy in and how well they comply with the city’s safety guidelines. Approval of the longer permits could immediately result in more vehicles available for rental. Transportation staff announced last month that the department had received applications from 11 companies to deploy nearly 40,000 bikes and scooters. To address sidewalk access issues, the city will allow residents to record violations using its 311 reporting system. Between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., companies will be required to respond within two hours to complaints about “improperly parked” vehicles. If they don’t, city workers will be authorized to impound the vehicles. But Cedillo is taking a cautious approach to the first year of the new permitting process. “Until LADOT’s one-year pilot has concluded it would be fitting to limit the locations where the electric scooters can operate,” he writes in his motion. The motion, which was seconded by councilmembers Jose Huizar and Greig Smith, will still need to be approved by the full City Council—as well as the council’s transportation committee—before a ban on bikes and scooters can go into effect. That could be a tricky obstacle, as two of the three councilmembers on the committee have been enthusiastic about the potential of dockless vehicles to provide residents with new alternatives to driving. Cedillo isn’t the first Los Angeles official to resist the proliferation of dockless vehicles on streets and sidewalks. Last year, Councilmember Paul Koretz—the third member of the transportation committee—proposed a temporary citywide ban on electric scooters. That motion was eventually shot down by the council’s public safety committee, though transportation staffers did commit to sending cease-and-desist letters to companies operating without permits.",https://la.curbed.com/2019/3/4/18250204/los-angeles-scooters-bike-ban-cedillo
Santa Monica scooter rider killed in hit-and-run,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,3,19,"Santa Monica scooter rider killed in hit-and-run. It’s one of the first fatal electric scooter crashes in Southern California. Police in Santa Monica are searching for a driver who fatally struck an electric scooter rider before fleeing the scene Friday. The identity of the 41-year-old victim hasn’t yet been released, but police say that he was riding a personal scooter, rather than one of the dockless devices that have proliferated in the city since companies like Bird and Lime began depositing them on sidewalks there in 2017. According to police, the victim fell off the scooter prior to the crash and was hit while recovering from the fall. The driver, described as a six-foot-two white man in his 30s, reportedly stopped briefly and exited his vehicle before leaving the scene, on Third Street in Ocean Park. The victim died at a nearby hospital. In the last two years, scooters—and their riders—have become a regular sight in Santa Monica, where the rentable scooters average three or four rides per day. The deadly collision Friday appears to be the first in the city involving an electric scooter. A medical study released earlier this year found that emergency rooms at two hospitals in the Los Angeles area (including UCLA Medical Center Santa Monica) nearly 250 patients were treated for scooter-related injuries during a one-year period. Most of the injuries were mild enough that patients were sent home after treatment, though two head injuries were severe enough that patients were taken to intensive care. Less than 10 percent of injuries were caused by a collision with a motor vehicle. Deaths related to scooters have also been rare in the greater Los Angeles area, though the Santa Monica crash Friday wasn’t the only deadly incident in Southern California last week. In San Diego, 53-year-old Georgia resident Christopher Conti died after crashing into a tree while riding a Bird scooter. Neither Conti or the victim of the Santa Monica hit-and-run were reportedly wearing helmets while riding—though as of January, California law no longer requires scooter riders to wear them.",https://la.curbed.com/2019/3/19/18272739/scooter-death-santa-monica-hit-and-run
A Data Pro Made a Map That Tracks Where All the Scooters in L.A. Are Concentrated,LA Magazine,Hour Media Group,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,4,8,"A Data Pro Made a Map That Tracks Where All the Scooters in L.A. Are Concentrated. What’s more interesting than where all the e-scooters are? Where they aren’t. Curious where scooters do and don’t wind up in L.A.? Timothy Black, a former data analyst for the L.A. Department of Transportation, has created a live, interactive map showing the current location of available scooters and dockless bikes in the city. To build the map, Black used data the city requires scooter companies to make publicly accessible. While he says the map isn’t a complete snapshot of every dockless vehicle in L.A., Black was able to include location data from all scooter companies that have received conditional permits to operate in the city, which include Lime, Bird, Lyft, Wheels, Spin, and Uber-owned Jump. “Looking at the map, you can get a pretty good sense of where different companies are putting their scooters,” he said. “And the main areas are Venice, Koreatown, Hollywood, and downtown.” For anyone who spends time on the Westside, it won’t come as a surprise that Venice has by far the most scooters and bikes of any neighborhood, with around 2,100 devices available at a given time. Koreatown, Hollywood, Westwood, and downtown, meanwhile, each average around 700 to 1,000 vehicles. In total, the map shows around 12,300 available scooters and bikes throughout the city at any time. (The map doesn’t show scooters currently in transit.) Black also created layouts for 26 other cities, which can also be viewed on the map, but most provide a more limited depiction of available scooters since the majority of local governments don’t require companies to make the location data accessible. Perhaps more interesting than where scooters are located is where they aren’t. According to the map, vehicles are all but absent in lower-income neighborhoods such as Boyle Heights, Sylmar, and Hyde Park. That’s despite existing incentives for scooter companies to deploy in low-income neighborhoods, which the L.A. City Council created when it approved rules for conditional permits last year. Each company is currently limited to 3,000 vehicles anywhere in the city but can operate an additional 2,500 in low-income areas. On top of that, companies can deploy up to 5,000 more scooters in low-income areas in the San Fernando Valley. According to Black’s map, however, Lime is the only company operating in the Valley, with around 200 devices. But that could be about to change. According to a recent press release, LADOT has issued one-year permits to allow a total of 22,500 scooters in the city. Of that amount, 14,000 must operate in “disadvantaged communities,” as defined by state guidelines. The companies that received the permits—Lime, Spin, and Bird—can began deploying the additional scooters starting April 15. “LADOT is committed to servicing communities that have historically been left out of new technology products,” the agency said in a statement. “Along those lines, providers are required to create an equity plan to ensure that low income neighborhoods have equitable access to dockless vehicles.” Still, sizable portions of Hollywood, Koreatown, and downtown—which are already teeming with scooters—are designated as disadvantaged communities. That means it’s conceivable that companies could meet disadvantaged quotas by deploying in these already scooter-heavy areas, all while continuing to ignore many low-income neighborhoods.",https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/los-angeles-scooter-map/
Downtown Enters the Scooter Age ,LA Downtown News,,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,4,8,"Downtown Enters the Scooter Age. Motorized scooters have been ubiquitous in certain Los Angeles neighborhoods for a couple years now. They have not yet inundated Downtown, but that could change quickly. This is because the city Department of Transportation last month launched a one-year pilot program for dockless vehicles, and according to the LADOT’s website, permits for 31,500 devices have been granted. Expect a sizable number to be deployed to Downtown Los Angeles. This stands to initiate a new era of mobility in the community, and there is amazing potential to get people to leave their car in the garage. Widespread scooter use could be key in resolving the “first-mile/last-mile” challenge, which refers to getting people from their home to some form of mass transit, and then from the bus or train stop to their job. An array of options are necessary, and inexpensive and easy-to-use scooters stand to play a big role. At the same time, there is an almost bottomless well of potential trouble points and safety concerns. The entry of scooters into neighborhoods has been followed by scooter clutter as people drop the devices anywhere and everywhere, sometimes mid-sidewalk. Additionally, riders pay varying degrees of attention, and more people on wheels means more potential accidents. The success of the pilot program will depend on education, some enforcement, and quick response as well as adaptability from the scooter companies and LADOT. Users must treat riding a scooter as they do driving a car, with constant attention and a focus on the device and their surroundings. A March 22 statement from LADOT boasts that the expansion of Los Angeles’ dockless scooter program makes it the largest in the country. Companies will each be able to deploy up to 10,000 devices citywide, with a higher number allowed if they move beyond affluent areas and also operate in what are termed “disadvantaged communities.” Still, the gold rush will be in Downtown, where hundreds of thousands of people work every day. This is made clear by the creation in Downtown of what are termed “Parking Zones,” which are basically patches of sidewalk with some signage on the ground. Users are requested to leave scooters and bikes in those spots, but unless there are something like two designated zones per block, this is a foolish hope. People use the devices to ride directly to their destination. Almost no one will park a block or two away and then walk. The most important challenge concerns safety. Although scooters are not allowed on sidewalks, some people will ride them there, and the danger of collisions, including as pedestrians and riders come around blind corners, is clear. The LAPD can ticket people who ride on sidewalks. Scooter companies must aggressively inform customers that only street use is allowed. There are additional challenges. Potholes and cracks in bike lanes pose issues, and though every scooter user should wear a helmet, few will. Car drivers will have to get used to sharing the streets with scooter users, some of whom will be inattentive. There is great potential here, but also risk. Scooters in Downtown give people new options, but that comes with responsibility.",http://www.ladowntownnews.com/opinion/downtown-enters-the-scooter-age/article_cda1a1c0-57fa-11e9-89c1-836825603b5a.html
Over 100 scooters impounded in first six months of pilot program,Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,4,12,"Over 100 scooters impounded in first six months of pilot program. Since scooters arrived in Santa Monica more than a year ago, 105 scooter and bike parking zones have been stenciled on city streets and sidewalks and police have issued 1,542 citations to riders. The City of Santa Monica released an update on the Shared Mobility Pilot Program Monday, six months after it launched last fall. The program, which will last another 10 months, authorizes Bird, Lime, Lyft and Jump, which is owned by Uber, to operate within city limits with a combined 2,000 scooters and 1,000 bikes. The City has cited or impounded more than 100 unauthorized devices from other companies since last fall. The City initiated the program following the rapid proliferation of the devices in late 2017, when Bird first launched in Santa Monica. The initial phase of the program deployed public education and signage around scooter safety, including bus advertising and painted stencils marking out no-ride zones. The City is doubling down on those strategies ahead of the busy summer tourist season, with plans to install more signage and partner with the four companies to educate riders on the rules of the road. It has already started installing 100 permanent signs indicating dismount zones downtown and in other areas and 35 signs along the beach bike path and in Palisades Park identifying the areas as off-limits. While scooters and electric bikes are not allowed on the beach bike path, the park and the Promenade, the City currently requires the four last mile companies to slow down devices in the prohibited areas instead of halting them. Deputy City Manager Anuj Gupta told The Daily Press in February that the City decided to slow the devices because if they powered down completely, riders would abandon them en masse and create pileups. Reducing their speed would give riders a chance to move out of prohibited areas, he said. That will change this summer, said acting chief mobility officer Francie Stefan. The City will require the four companies to slow devices on the beach bike path and the Promenade to zero or one mile per hour. Companies are required to remove clusters of scooters that build up, Stefan said. The City is also trying to control where riders park their scooters and bikes. Since last fall, 35 in-street and 70 off-street parking zones for scooters and bikes have been installed throughout Santa Monica, clustering in commercial areas like Main Street and Montana Avenue. Stefan said the companies are currently developing incentives for riders to use the parking zones. If the incentives don’t work, the City will ask them to develop disincentives, she said, citing Breeze Bike Share’s $1 charge for leaving a bike outside its station as an example. “They can try out some incentives and we’ll see how they perform,” Stefan said. Other changes to the pilot program include new safety checks and additional enforcement by the Santa Monica Police Department, the details of which are still being ironed out, said Lieutenant Saul Rodriguez. The pilot program has required operators to comply with safety requirements set by the City and the state since it launched, but since early this year, code enforcement officers have been conducting regular spot checks of the devices’ brakes, handlebars and lights, Stefan said. Recent testing has raised concerns about the efficacy of some scooter brakes. Earlier this year, a local forensic engineer tested a scooter model that uses electric brakes activated with the rider’s thumb and found it could not come to a complete stop on a sloping road. The test was conducted as research for a lawsuit against Bird on behalf of riders who were injured after jumping off of scooters that were unable to stop on hills. The engineer told The Daily Press in February that scooters equipped with electric brakes as opposed to manual brakes were “effectively useless” on hills and “a hidden hazard.” Stefan said the City requires scooters to comply with state rules on brakes and its spot checks evaluate the functionality of the brakes on each device. “If we were to test a vehicle that is unable to come to a stop, we would notify the company that it needs to be taken out of service,” she said.",https://www.smdp.com/over-100-scooters-impounded-in-first-six-months-of-pilot-program/174230
"Burbank looks to set rules for rental electric scooters, bicycles",Burbank Leader,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,4,19,"Burbank looks to set rules for rental electric scooters, bicycles. With pay-to-ride electric scooters and bicycles sprouting up in different cities across L.A. County, Burbank officials are looking to ensure that those services benefit the community rather than becoming a nuisance. The transportation division of the Burbank Community Development Department held a community meeting on Thursday to present a proposed ordinance that would regulate shared-use mobility devices — the scooters and bicycles operated by companies such as Bird and Lime — within the city’s limits. Nick Burant, an administrative analyst for the transportation division, said the prevalence of shared scooters and bicycles has been considerably growing and that the devices are inevitably going to appear in Burbank. The scooters and bicycles have become a popular transportation alternative for short-distance trips of about 1 or 2 miles. They are relatively cheaper than using a ride-sharing service for a short trip. Burant said some operators charge $1 to use an electric scooter and 15 cents per minute. “We want to offer it as a transportation alternative, as a first-mile, last-mile solution,” Burant said. “We’ve got three major rail stations in the city, and we’re pretty close to the [Metro] Red Line station, and we hope to see these as a solution that people can use to come into the city or take from these regional transportation hubs to go to places throughout Burbank.” At issue is users’ tendency to leave the scooters or bicycles on sidewalks and the pedestrian right-of-way. Burant said city officials propose charging operators $20,000 annually to have their devices in Burbank. Additionally, the proposed ordinance would charge operators $300 per device annually. The potential funds generated by the fees would go toward enforcement, administrative costs and infrastructure improvements, such as corrals for people to park their rented scooters or bicycles, Burant said. He added that funds generated by Measure P, a city sales tax in which at least half of the funds are committed to infrastructure improvements, cannot be used for this program. Burant said the city is looking to cap the total number of devices — scooters and bicycles — at 1,000. Each operator would only be allowed to bring a maximum of 200 devices into the city. The proposed regulations outline where the devices should be parked and maintenance requirements for the devices. It also states the city can impound scooters and bicycles if they are found parked illegally. Additionally, Burbank officials are looking to require that operators share their data with city officials so they can both determine where service and infrastructure can be improved. The proposed ordinance is scheduled to be reviewed by the City Council in late next month.",https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-me-scooter-ordinance-20190419-story.html
"Long Beach moves ahead on making e-scooters permanent, tripling their numbers ",Press-Telegram,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,5,4,"Long Beach moves ahead on making e-scooters permanent, tripling their numbers. The unanimous vote was a first reading and will come back to the panel for a final reading at its meeting next week. If the council approves it once more, the ordinance will go into effect 30 days later. The e-scooters are here to stay, Long Beach. The City Council voted at its Tuesday, May 14 meeting to approve an ordinance that would permanently allow the vehicles to roam Long Beach streets — and could more than triple their numbers. Scooters are currently operating under a pilot program in Long Beach, which the city launched in July. Under the pilot, 1,800 scooters are allowed in the city. But the permanent program will increase that number to 4,000 for the first six months and move to 6,000 after that. The unanimous vote was a first reading and will come back to the panel for a final reading at its meeting next week. If the council approves it once more, the ordinance will go into effect 30 days later. The long-term program will allow up to six companies to operate in Long Beach. Currently, scooters from five companies are available: Bird, Lime, Spin, Skip and Razor. Uscooter previously operated in the pilot program but has since dropped out. Public Works Director Craig Beck said those scooter companies will not get any type of priority or favorable treatment in the permanent program. Every company, including those already running in Long Beach, will have to submit a new application. Companies will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, as long as they are able to meet all of the city’s requirements. Beck added that the program was written so as not to be limited to electric scooters; companies that rent electric bikes could be eligible to operate in the program, as well. One of the requirements that vendors will have to adhere to that was not included in the pilot program is the ability to geo-fence, or use technology in the scooters to prevent them from being ridden in areas where they’re prohibited, like in parks or on the beach path. Companies will also be required to provide comprehensive monthly reports to the city that includes data on how many scooters are being used, where they’re being used, how long trips are and more. As part of the vote, City Councilman Rex Richardson said he wanted to make sure the program is an equitable one, where scooters and bikes are accessible to all Long Beach residents. He said the city’s bike share program did not include measures to ensure the bikes made their way up to his district in North Long Beach, so that never happened. “The lesson I’ve learned,” he said, “is we need to put these things in the policy on Day One.” Richardson said he’d like to see companies be required to distribute 40% of their scooters in parts of the city that are shown to be the most affected by pollution through CalEnviroScreen ratings. In addition to having a better understanding of how companies are operating in the city, Beck said the program would also equip Long Beach with more tools to enforce rules like the one Richardson proposed. The idea of informing the vendors about the city’s regulations when they apply and assessing their applications based on those rules, Beck said, is to tell them: “If you want to operate in Long Beach,” he said, “this is what you’re going to have to comply with.”",https://www.presstelegram.com/2019/05/14/long-beach-moves-ahead-on-making-e-scooters-permanent-tripling-their-numbers/
"Bird Is Rolling Out A New Scooter In LA — And It's All Yours For $1,300",LAist,Gothamist,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,5,8,"Bird Is Rolling Out A New Scooter In LA — And It's All Yours For $1,300. You might notice a new electric, dockless scooter cruising city streets starting this week. Santa Monica-based Bird just unveiled its latest model, Bird One, which is being marketed as a more durable scooter with a longer battery life and range than previous vehicles. The new scooters are rolling out in the Los Angeles market first, joining the company's shared, dockless fleet beginning Wednesday, Bird announced. They'll also be on sale for a whopping $1,299 (that's before tax and delivery fees). The company has opened pre-orders for a limited number of Bird Ones, which come in black, white and rose gold (to match your iPhone). ""We think it's by far the sexiest scooter on the market,"" is a real sentence Bird founder and CEO Travis VanderZanden told the L.A. Times regarding the new model. It's worth noting that the first-generation Bird scooter model, made by the Chinese company Xiaomi, is currently available on Amazon for $448. The new scooters come with a one-year warranty, access to Bird service centers, GPS tracking and a ""digital lock,"" but no physical anti-theft features. The company says Bird One owners will also have access to the Bird Hunter Network, contractors trained to locate and recover missing scooters. It's not clear from the release how Bird hunters would deal with an alleged scooter thief. Bird has a lot riding on its new and improved scooters, amid reporting they've struggled to make a profit on the micromobility technology. The Verge reported last month that the life spans of earlier models on the streets aren't sustainable. An L.A. Times report found that Bird scooters in L.A. County weren't lasting long enough for the company to break even on them, given the costs for maintenance, charging and fees to cities where they're operating. In a press release announcing its new scooter, VanderZanden said that while first-generation scooters lasted about three months on average, the more recent Bird Zero model ""lasts over 10 months in the sharing environment on average."" The new Bird One is projected to last ""well over a year,"" he added. Scooter vandals might have something to say about that.",https://laist.com/2019/05/08/birds_new_e-scooter_is_coming_to_la_and_can_be_yours_for_1300.php

Santa Monica police conducted a special enforcement operation focused on drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and electric scooter users in Santa Monica. Some of the problems — Electric scooter riders on sidewalks, two people on one scooter, and blowing through stop signs. Electric scooter riders must obey traffic laws while riding on scooters, police like to remind the public. ""So you're supposed to be riding on the roads,"" said rider Steve Dimopoulos who was visiting from Detroit. ""I didn't know that so it's good to know."" Police say breaking the law could put people at risk in Santa Monica. The NBC4 I-Team found 95 percent of all scooter violations 121 of 127 citations to scooter riders in Santa Monica so far this year have been for people riding on the sidewalk. ""They should be on the streets rather than on the sidewalks,"" said Enoch Girman. Police say that's the single biggest complaint they get about scooter riders. But some see it differently. ""People ride bikes on the sidewalk; people ride scooters on the sidewalks,"" said Joel Monteleone, a Santa Monica resident. ""I can understand why because it's a little dangerous on the street."" The bulk of more than 1,400 citations related to electric scooters handed out in Santa Monica from January to December 2018 went to people riding without a helmet. But state law changed at the beginning of this year. Now only those under 18 years old are required to wear helmets. A handful of citations in 2018 went to people not riding closest to the right curb, a couple for being underage, and several dozen for riding on the beach bike path, which is not allowed. ""They are fun,"" said Steve, an e-scooter rider. ""They are convenient. Here's a check list: To ride an electric scooter in California, you need a driver's license or instruction permit; You cannot travel over 15 mph and DUI laws apply when riding electric scooters; Individual cities and counties can have their own rules.",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/new-enforcement-team-cracks-down-on-electronic-scooter-scofflaws/81298/
"Survey results measure scooters’ impact on driving, walking habits",Santa Monica Daily Press,,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,5,13,"Survey results measure scooters’ impact on driving, walking habits. About half of scooter and bicycle riders used the devices to replace a car trip but locals made up only 35 percent of total trips in Santa Monica, according to the results of a survey tracking usage of e-scooters and on-demand bike rentals. Most people who ride e-scooters and e-bikes in Santa Monica are young (42 percent are between 25-34), male and affluent (37 percent reported income over $100,000), according to a survey released Wednesday. The user survey was created by the City of Santa Monica and was open to responses from Jan. 25 to Feb. 15. The four scooter and bike companies authorized to operate in the city distributed the survey through email and in-app pop-ups. A total of 4,700 users self-selected to respond to the survey, with approximately 3,000 completing all 21 questions. The survey gathered demographic information and gauged riders’ knowledge of Santa Monica’s shared mobility pilot program, which launched last September and regulates Bird, Lime, Lyft and Jump (which is owned by Uber). Only 10 percent of those surveyed reported being unfamiliar with the pilot program, including its prohibition on riding on sidewalks, and 59 percent said they were very familiar with it. 86 percent of all riders know they are not allowed to ride on the sidewalk, but 20 percent still do. 77 percent ride on streets with bike lanes and half ride on streets without bike lanes and 20 percent ride on the sidewalk. About 70 percent know that they can’t ride on the Promenade or beach path and slightly less than half know they are not allowed in Palisades Park. According to the survey, 35 percent of riders are Santa Monicans, 44 percent are from elsewhere in Los Angeles County and 21 percent live outside the county. 42 percent are between 25 and 34, 21 percent are 18 to 24 and two percent are under 18. 34 percent are 35 and older. 69 percent are men. About half of riders earn more than $75,000. 28 percent earn between $30,000 and $75,000 and 20 percent earn less than $30,000. Three-quarters of riders own a vehicle, less than 10 percent share a vehicle and 15 percent don’t have access to one. Riders use scooters and bikes for a wide range of purposes. Work and recreation trips were the most commonly reported trips, at 31 percent and 23 percent of trips, respectively. “Respondents reported that 50 percent of their most recent shared mobility trips displaced a car trip (including drive alone, ride share services, taxi, etc.),” said the results. “While 38 percent of shared mobility trips displace a walking trip.” Most respondents said their use of other transit options (train, bus, personal bikes, Breeze Bikes and walking) were unchanged but among those who had changed their habits all other forms of transit lost users overall. About 16 percent of bike/scooter riders said they use the train more while 23 percent said they used it less. Only 3.4 percent of riders said they used Breeze more often while 40 percent said they used it less. The results said 18 percent of respondents reported walking more while 24 percent reported walking less. 44 percent use the devices less than once per week, 30 percent use them one to three times per week and 26 percent use them more than three times per week. 54 percent said a lack of bike lanes prevent them from riding scooters or bikes as much as they would like, and 45 percent said it was difficult to locate the devices. Two-thirds rarely or never use helmets, which is not a requirement in California under a state law that went into effect Jan. 1.",https://www.smdp.com/survey-results-measure-scooters-impact-on-driving-walking-habits/175458
"Scooters, Scooters Everywhere. Here's How LA's Grand Experiment Is Going",LAist,Gothamist,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,5,28,"Scooters, Scooters Everywhere. Here's How LA's Grand Experiment Is Going. Los Angeles is in the midst of an experiment on 72,340 wheels. You've likely seen test subjects zipping down streets (or more likely sidewalks) in or near your neighborhood. Yes, we're talking about e-scooters. Turns out they're on a lot of Angelenos' minds lately. In the nine days from April 25 to May 3 this year, L.A.'s 311 service request system received more than 1,200 reports related to scooters — from bad parking to broken vehicles. That averages out to about 133 scooter complaints per day, or more than five an hour. The city is six weeks into its one-year Dockless Mobility Program, in which eight companies — including Bird, Lime, Lyft and the Uber-owned Jump — have been permitted to drop tens of thousands of electric scooters and bikes on sidewalks across L.A. Similar pilot programs are underway in Long Beach and Santa Monica, and another is in the works for unincorporated L.A. County. The mission of the program is to study how the dockless vehicles are being used, understand safety concerns and figure out how the devices might fit into local governments' wider vision for mobility. Cities have struggled to draft rules to catch up with the spread of e-scooters, which first appeared in Santa Monica in September 2017. Approximately one million rides were taken on e-scooters and e-bikes in the first month of the program (April 15 to May 15), according to Marcel Porras, chief sustainability officer for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Porras, whose office is leading the pilot program, said the city is managing the largest dockless vehicle fleet in the country. That puts L.A. in a unique ""leadership role,"" he said, as other U.S. cities take note of how the scooter craze plays out here. ""(There are) all these subtleties that we're really looking forward to exploring,"" he told LAist, ""so that we can continue to educate our policymakers, and then also educate the operators themselves and figure out together how best to leverage this huge private investment that we're seeing on the streets of L.A."" So, as scooters continue to spread across Los Angeles, how is the city managing them? How many are even out there? And how often are people getting hurt? Just how many scooters are out there? Here's a full breakdown of the maximum number of scooters LADOT is allowing each company to operate on city streets: Bird - 6,500 Lime - 5,500 Lyft - 4,000 Spin - 10,500 Jump - 2,750 Sherpa - 670 Bolt - 500 That adds up to more than 30,400 scooters in L.A. if each company reaches its cap. Electric dockless bicycles are also part of the program, with 2,750 permitted to Jump and 3,000 for the company Wheels. LADOT officials said about 20,000 total vehicles (including e-bikes) are on the streets so far, but more than 16,000 can still be deployed. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE RIDERS AND COMPANIES BEHAVE? That gets a little complicated. Scooter-related responsibilities are spread among a few city departments — and technically the scooter companies themselves. LADOT is attempting to control the general scooter chaos by collecting and analyzing data, developing a public education campaign, and making sure Bird, Lime and all the other operators are following the rules. The department even created parking zones for scooters (and e-bikes) in an effort to keep sidewalks from becoming obstacle courses. So far there are roughly 30 of them, mostly downtown. The Los Angeles Police Department is tasked with writing tickets for bad rider behavior, namely sidewalk riding. If a scooter is parked in the same spot more than five days straight, the L.A. Sanitation Bureau is responsible for removing it. We asked if that means there's a scooter jail but a bureau spokeswoman said city sanitation workers have not removed any loitering scooters to date. The other check on scooter companies is everyday citizens (like you!). LADOT is tracking scooter-related issues through the city's 311 system, which now includes a specific category for the public to report badly parked or broken vehicles — or any scooters they notice up a tree, in a trash can or thrown in a local waterway (the hate is very real). You can file a report over the phone, via email, on the city's website or through the MyLA311 mobile app. When LADOT receives a service request and identifies which company owns the scooter in question, they alert that operator — and the company is required to respond within two hours. LADOT officials said they have the right to suspend or revoke a company's permit if they don't comply. ""The burden then on the city is really reduced, because we don't have to then go out and respond to dozens of service requests a day,"" an LADOT spokesperson said. ""That onus is on providers, but we can track how quickly they're closing out the requests."" So far, the response from the public has been ""significant,"" the spokesperson said, referring to those roughly 1,200 scooter complaints filed in one nine-day period. HOW IS L.A. MAKING SCOOTERS ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE? Locally, scooters and e-bikes have traditionally been placed in tourist-heavy hubs like Venice and Santa Monica. But LADOT put incentives in place for companies to deploy scooters in ""disadvantaged communities"" (DAC) throughout the city, with a particular focus on the San Fernando Valley. LADOT designates those zones using data from California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the state's environmental protection agency, which identified communities ""disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution."" Companies are allowed a higher vehicle cap and sharply reduced fees for the portion of their fleets operating in these neighborhoods. The majority of Spin's scooter fleet (8,000) is operating in disadvantaged communities, which explains why the Ford-owned company has the largest fleet in the program. About 3,500 Limes and 2,500 Birds are also deployed in DAC zones, LADOT officials said, adding that nearly a third of scooters citywide are in the Valley. An LADOT spokesperson said that investment fits within the department philosophy ""that everyone in L.A. deserves safe and affordable transportation choices."" Scooter companies are also required to maintain equity programs that offer low-income residents discounted access to their vehicles without requiring a smartphone (since not everyone has one). Spin offers free, one-time rides under 30 minutes to riders who ""provide proof of low-income status, such as enrollment in EBT, First Five, reduced or free lunch benefits, or any low-income utility program,"" according to a company spokeswoman. Lime slices its normal charges in half for riders who qualify, while Bird drops the $1 activation fee. But as Juan Matute, deputy director of UCLA's Institute of Transportation Studies, explained, just because scooters and bikes are dropped in these areas doesn't mean the people who live there are riding them. ""It doesn't necessarily mean that people who have more limited mobility options (or) lower incomes are using them,"" he said. ""What other places are finding (is) that it's actually necessary to do a user survey to try to figure out the sociodemographics of the users... and then compare that with those who are living in the neighborhoods (and) working in the neighborhoods to get a better idea of how effective the equity programs are."" WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SAFETY CONCERNS? It should shock no one that a new mode of human transportation means a new way for humans to hurt themselves and others. There's plenty of social media evidence showing that people are getting injured on scooters, but it's hard to say just how often it's happening, since local governments and public health agencies are just beginning to study rider behavior and ER visits. Late last year, the Los Angeles Fire Department started tracking the number of times its firefighters respond to scenes where an e-scooter is involved, department spokesman Erik Scott said. So far in 2019, LAFD personnel have been called to 74 scooter-related incidents, according to Scott. In 55 of those calls, someone was transported to a local hospital, but LAFD officials could not speak to the nature of their injuries. The LAPD monitors and publishes traffic collision data through its traffic division, but the city's public records office could not provide specific scooter-related data because ""there isn't any tracking [system] that differentiates electric scooters from other two-wheeled vehicles,"" according to a city official. We've reported previously on how scooter-related injuries are being studied locally. Here's a cliff notes version of a UCLA-led report published in January: The most common rider injuries are to the head A notable share of the injured are minors Hardly any riders wear helmets A study out of Austin, Texas published in early May showed more of the same. The city's public health department found that 190 people were injured while riding e-scooters over a 3-month period. Nearly half sustained head injuries and 15% suffered a traumatic brain injury. Just one percent of riders were wearing helmets. In both studies, researchers said they likely underestimated how often scooter riders are getting hurt. But health officials and firefighters have roughly the same message to reduce the risk of injury: slow down, pay attention and wear a damn helmet. It may not be the law anymore, but it could mean the difference between a headache and a skull fracture. Porras said his office plans to work closely with the city's Vision Zero team, along with LAPD, LAFD and city planning officials ""to understand root causes to severe scooter crashes."" So far, one scooter rider death has been reported in the city of L.A. During a police pursuit in Hollywood last month, a suspected DUI driver struck a 31-year-old man riding in a crosswalk. The man, who was visiting from Dallas, died at a local hospital. In March, a man riding a scooter in Santa Monica fell off the vehicle and was fatally run over by a passing car. The driver fled the scene. To put those deaths into perspective, preliminary LAPD data showed 127 pedestrians and 21 bicyclists were killed on L.A. streets last year. ALL EYES ON L.A. — AND ITS DATA L.A. might be leading the quest to harness the potential of dockless mobility, but Porras said it's just one piece of ""the larger ecosystem of cities"" working to understand how the scooters and bikes fit into their larger vision for getting people around. ""In order for us to be at the table investing in (mobility) decisions, we have to understand what's really happening,"" Porras said. And that means collecting data. LADOT created a data specification which each operator is required to implement, giving cities immediate access to raw, live location data on every scooter and e-bike trip in L.A. ""We don't have to rely on each of the companies pitching us and telling us what it is they need — we can see it,"" Porras said. ""We can see where they're deploying, we can see where the hotspots are (and) we see where the pain points are for community stakeholders."" About 50 cities are regularly accessing those datasets from operators, according to an LADOT spokesperson. City officials said they're taking steps to ""de-identify"" the data so that riders' personal information is not made public, but privacy experts have voiced concerns. In a letter to LADOT General Manager Seleta Reynolds, the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology urged the department to put more safeguards in place to protect riders' information. ""Taking rider privacy seriously will help Los Angeles lead the way for other cities adopting similar pilot programs,"" the letter reads. City officials said they ""will make no data available to law enforcement agencies through this process that is not already available to them from Operators now."" At least one scooter company, Jump, pushed back against LADOT's data-sharing requirement, but eventually agreed to the terms to stay in the program.",https://laist.com/2019/05/28/las_big_scooter_experiment.php
LA leaders say scooter companies must ‘step up and do better’,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,6,14,"LA leaders say scooter companies must ‘step up and do better’. City councilmembers aren’t impressed with the results of a pilot program regulating the devices. Three months into a new permitting program regulating dockless bikes and scooters on the streets of Los Angeles, city leaders expressed frustration Wednesday with the results of the one-year pilot so far. “I don’t think any of the scooter companies are living up to the expectations I hoped they’d be at at this point,” said Los Angeles City Councilmember Mike Bonin at a meeting of the council’s transportation committee. Bonin, who heads the committee, has been a key supporter of the bikes and scooters, which began popping up last year on Westside sidewalks and quickly spread to other parts of the city. But this week, he complained that coastal neighborhoods in his district have become oversaturated with the electric devices. He also complained that vehicles continue to be parked improperly despite city rules requiring companies to move them when they block access to sidewalks or create tripping hazards. Meanwhile, Uber and other companies have challenged the city on its right to collect data on the locations of scooters, which transportation officials say they need to assess the success of the program. “Everyone’s trying to prove this works,” said Bonin. “So if these companies really want this to work, step up and do better.” Councilmember Paul Koretz, a strong critic of the program who last year proposed a total ban on electric scooters, said he’d still like to see the devices go away. “I would love to completely get rid of these, and that’s my goal,” Koretz said, citing concerns about safety. “I think there’s no safe place to ride them,” he said. “It’s unsafe for pedestrians when [scooter users] ride them on sidewalks, but I think it’s unsafe for the scooter riders when they ride them in the streets.” Koretz suggested that a “robust” network of bike lanes would make the vehicles more viable, but argued that such a system might not be possible in Los Angeles because “some streets just don’t have the room.” Councilmember Gil Cedillo has also been a frequent critic of the devices, and in March proposed barring them from his district. On Wednesday, he asked the transportation committee to delay a vote on that motion to a future meeting. Since being introduced in the Los Angeles area, the scooters, which can be easily rented through a mobile app, have inspired fierce debate among residents and elected officials. To critics, they are little more than dangerous toys that create clutter on sidewalks and impede the passage of those with disabilities. To advocates, they are convenient, eco-friendly mobility devices that encourage people to connect to transit and leave their cars at home. “I can’t begin to tell you how I’ve been empowered by these things,” Downtown resident Mike Louaillier told the committee Wednesday. “I’m never going to get a car.” Under the terms of LA’s year-long pilot, which began in March, eight companies have been authorized to deploy a combined 36,170 devices (a mix of scooters and electric bikes) throughout the city. A report from the city’s transportation department shows the vehicles have gotten a fair amount of use. Between December 31 and April 15 (when companies only had conditional permits and could deploy fewer vehicles), users took nearly 1.9 million rides on the devices. And since a reporting system was introduced, in which residents can alert the city about improperly parked bikes and scooters, 3,137 requests have been made to LA’s 311 system. Companies are required to respond to these reports within two hours or face fines. If they ignore requests for too long, devices can be impounded—though this step hasn’t been necessary so far, according to the transportation department. The report also indicates that scooter crashes have become a frequent occurrence. The Los Angeles Police Department recorded 52 scooter collisions between January 1 and April 27. In the time between January 1 and May 25, the Los Angeles Fire Department created 80 electronic reports detailing medical treatments to those injured while riding scooters. A UCLA report released earlier this year analyzed 228 scooter-related injuries treated at three emergency rooms over a year-long period between 2017 and 2018. Bonin said Wednesday that numbers like these might seem less alarming if placed into the larger context of street safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. According to the city’s Vision Zero program, a campaign to end traffic deaths by 2025, around 95 traffic collisions occur per day within city limits. In 2013 alone, nearly 1,500 people were killed or severely injured in such crashes. Bonin requested that transportation include data on bike and pedestrian injuries in future reports to better assess the true safety hazards of scooters. The full transportation committee also asked scooter companies to work with law enforcement to track down users in the event that a scooter rider should collide with a pedestrian and flee from the scene. The UCLA report indicated that 8 percent of those injured in scooter crashes were non-riders. Bonin made it clear he expected companies to work with city officials or risk losing out on the chance to do business in Los Angeles. “If the companies can’t behave themselves, there are going to be more than two councilmembers interested in seeing this thing go away,” he warned.",https://la.curbed.com/2019/6/14/18679094/los-angeles-scooters-rules-pilot
"Column: For L.A.’s disabled people, scooters and bad sidewalks aren’t the only hazards",Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,6,27,"Column: For L.A.’s disabled people, scooters and bad sidewalks aren’t the only hazards. For months as I’ve walked L.A.'s increasingly chaotic sidewalks, I’ve wondered how I would manage them in a wheelchair. How I would get around the e-scooters left strewn across my path and the ones zooming toward me even though they’re supposed to be on the street. The many stretches of root-buckled pavement that slope wonkily this way and that. All the tents. I thought I had identified a central problem for disabled people, but I had iceberg vision. What I’d been noticing, I have since been schooled, is just one small, exposed part of a mass of afterthought and neglect invisible to most of us. David Radcliff can’t ignore it. He lives it. He regularly finds himself in places where his passage is hampered or impossible. “It’s like going into the Matrix. You see the world in a very different way,” said the 36-year-old television writer, who worked on “The Rookie” and who has cerebral palsy. We should all pay better attention, he said: “Disability isn’t something that’s going to happen for other people. It’s going to happen for just about everybody.” And if and when it does, unless we get informed and involved beforehand, the breadth of what changes in our lives will be jarring. Yes, messy sidewalks are hard. But so are shops and restaurants with steps at their entrances. So are blocks that lack curb cuts or have ones that are poorly designed. So are broken elevators. So is the fact that in L.A., if you’re a disabled person (which is what Radcliff calls himself rather than a person with a disability), you generally have to spend more on rent, because the properties covered by rent stabilization are older ones less likely to be accessible. More broadly, accommodating disability is often done in such a perfunctory, ungracious manner that it makes disabled people feel “othered,” lesser and separated from the rest of us. Radcliff says its not uncommon for him to be directed to a restaurant’s alleyway to find the only wheelchair-accessible entry. Once when he and a friend went to a concert at Pershing Square and staked out a spot on the grass, a guard told them they they were fire hazards (which became the name of their trivia team). He made them move to what was essentially a concrete pen — with a sign on it that said “ADA,” for the Americans With Disabilities Act. My original plan when I was focused on the sidewalks was to interview a lot of people who roll along them in wheelchairs — but the first two I reached, Radcliff and UCLA computer programmer Kat Kath, taught me so much so fast. They made me see that this is a highly complex subject, which I will have to return to and explore in parts. They also gave me a basic tutorial that I will try to give to you. Because we all — individuals, urban planners, architects, developers, designers, city employees — need to work harder to make the way smoother for Radcliff, Kath and others. And to think about how to more fully accommodate and respect those who have greater needs than the majority of us. Respect is key, as I’ve said before. Also, sometimes even the most well-intentioned help isn’t helpful. Kath, who is 30 and also refers to herself as a disabled person, pushes her own weight plus the 25 pounds of her wheelchair all day. She participates in an adaptive rowing program. Still, she told me, she often is infantilized or treated paternalistically by strangers who have no idea how very capable she is. She has a variety of serious conditions, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, a genetic disorder that causes her joints to pop out easily — and, of course, painfully. Jumping in to help her without being asked can injure her. And yet people often do so. And even when they ask, they often either don’t wait for or listen to her reply. Kath still feels residual anxiety from when a stranger startled her by calling out to her and then began pushing her wheelchair without her OK. In that moment, Kath dislocated a shoulder and a rib. “We talk a lot in this #MeToo culture about how no means no — but consent doesn’t just apply to sexual relations. Consent is everywhere,” she told me. “So take me at my word. When I say, ‘No, I’ve got the door’ — what, am I lying?” The prevalence of disability, by the way, is not debatable. Both Kath and Radcliff made the point that it is a common factor in homelessness, and that those living on the streets are often well-versed in it and considerate of others’ disabilities. (Tents, they told me, pose a far smaller problem than unthinking city planners and developers.) According to the Social Security Administration, for those who are 20 now, the odds of being disabled by retirement age are greater than 1 in 4. And when I asked Times data reporter Sandhya Kambhampati to crunch the census numbers, she found that in both our city and our county, 1 in 10 civilians who are not institutionalized report at least one form of disability, whether it be related to hearing, vision, cognition, walking, difficulty bathing or dressing or living independently. When it comes to mobility, I couldn’t have had a better guide than Radcliff, who does not own a car and travels the city widely using a wheelchair and crutches. He not only spoke to me frankly about his daily life, he took me out to experience it. One afternoon, we set off from a Starbucks in Studio City, where he lives, first to downtown L.A. to be in a crowd, and then to USC to take his laptop to a repair shop. From the get-go, the trip was eye-opening to me, starting with leaving the Starbucks in a busy shopping mall — which David had to do where cars entered and exited because the sidewalk in front of the shops didn’t continue all the way to the exit. It’s hard enough as a pedestrian in L.A. to trust that distracted drivers will notice you in a crosswalk. But imagine not being in a crosswalk and not being at their eye level. Getting from coffee to the Red Line went pretty smoothly. So did getting to Pershing Square station. Looking at that station through Radcliff’s eyes, though, was new to me. Did you ever stop to think that the same kind of planning designed to deny homeless people places to sleep also denies comfort to others who have physical problems and might need to take a seat and rest? I hadn’t until Radcliff pointed it out after we’d come up from the train platform in one elevator and were moving toward the second elevator required to take us to street level. We were in a big space with smooth walls and no seating. On his crutches, he said, he probably would have wanted to sit down. We were talking about that when we got to the second elevator, located to the right of steep escalators and stairs. In front of its closed door were yellow tape and yellow traffic cones that read “CAUTION: WET FLOOR.” On the wall, a sign: “NOTICE: ELEVATOR OUT OF SERVICE.” The sign had blanks to fill in to inform “patrons with disabilities” which bus lines they could take instead — though no one had bothered to fill in the blanks and Radcliff couldn’t reach the street to take a bus anyway. So we had to backtrack to another station — which, because we’d already been through the turnstiles, meant we had to pay another fare to get back on a train. It was one headache of many. At the next stop we tried, 7th Street/Metro Center, getting to the street also required two elevators, separated this time by a long stretch of below-ground shopping mall — in which some sort of event was being set up and a raised cover protected the production’s wires at the expense of a smooth ride for wheelchairs. At USC, we came off the Expo Line to a sidewalk closed for construction, then made it to the repair shop, where the counters were well above Radcliff’s head. On the way back to the train, we came to a spot straight out of my initial anxiety — a scooter blocking the way followed by root-warped sidewalk. Radcliff made it past the scooter, then up one side of the steepled cement. Coming over its lip, he hit a dip and tumbled out of his chair. He wasn’t hurt. People ran to help. But watching my fears come to life for a new friend felt terrible. It made me feel as scraped up inside as if it had happened to me. I’m starting to think that’s how we’ll all have to feel before, as a society, we’ll do better on so many fronts: This could be us. Therefore, this is unacceptable.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-27/disability-scooters-sidewalks-wheelchair-mobility
"As scooters flood Los Angeles, the number of tickets written to riders is soaring",Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,8,23,"As scooters flood Los Angeles, the number of tickets written to riders is soaring. As the number of electric scooters across Los Angeles has spiked, so has the number of tickets issued to their riders. The Los Angeles Police Department wrote 800 tickets to riders on the zippy electric vehicles between January of 2018 and mid-July, and cited them for more than 900 violations, according to city data analyzed by The Times. The ticketing rate rose sharply this summer as police officers targeted riders on the city’s narrow and sometimes crowded sidewalks, the data show. In June, officers wrote 249 citations, a 1,815% increase compared with the same time last year. Nearly two-thirds of the violations cited a California law that bans motorized vehicles on sidewalks. “If you are riding a scooter on a sidewalk, you will get a ticket,” said Paul Koretz, the most outspoken critic of scooters on the Los Angeles City Council, at a news conference Thursday in the Fairfax district. “It’s time to stop.” Bird, Lime and other companies have added stickers on the baseboards of their vehicles that say, “No riding on sidewalks.” But the practice is still the norm in L.A., where cars can often move at 35 mph or faster on city streets. Riding on sidewalks is “the most dangerous violation” for a scooter rider, Koretz said, because pedestrians can be knocked over if they can’t get out of the way. California law prohibits riding electric scooters on the sidewalk. Users can ride in the street if the posted speed limit is 25 mph or slower, as close to the right-hand curb as possible, the law says. Scooter riders can also use bicycle lanes. As Koretz and police officials spoke, six LAPD traffic officers rode by on motorcycles near Fairfax High School. Officers targeted scooter riders in the area for eight hours Thursday as part of the city’s effort to cut down on collisions and injuries, said Capt. Elaine Morales of the LAPD’s West Traffic Division Of the crashes the department has analyzed, Morales said, scooter riders were at fault more than half the time. From the start of the year through late May, the most recent data immediately available, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported a total of 160 incidents involving electric scooters. Those included 59 cases in which someone was taken to the hospital by paramedics or EMTs, and 21 cases in which a patient was treated without being transported. The face value of a sidewalk-riding citation is $197, but that figure does not include court processing costs or other fees. Bird and Lime scooters cost $1 to rent and charge users by the minute to ride, and typically require a credit card and a smartphone to get started. The majority of the citations analyzed by The Times were written in downtown, Hollywood and the Westside, where many of the scooters are concentrated. Some written citations included multiple violations, such as riding on the sidewalk and riding without a valid driver’s license, The Times found. After months of tinkering with regulations for scooter and shared bicycle companies, Los Angeles officials formally launched a one-year pilot program in April that tracks where the scooters operate and regulates how many are allowed within city limits. About 36,000 scooters are now registered to eight companies across L.A., Transportation Department spokeswoman Connie Llanos said. The number of scooters operating in the city has been lower. In the third week of July, the average number of vehicles citywide was closer to 21,000, according to a recent report to a City Council committee. The council districts that include Venice Beach and downtown L.A. had nearly 8,500 scooters between them, accounting for about 40% of the scooters across the city, the report said. The three districts that cover the western and northern sections of the San Fernando Valley had an average of 118 scooters available per day between them during the same time period. At the end of July, Fairfax — where the enforcement took place Thursday — was the fourth-busiest neighborhood for scooter riding, with a daily average of 719 trips per square mile, according to the Transportation Department. The busiest area was Venice Beach, with 1,756 trips per square mile.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-22/electric-scooters-sidewalk-helmet-los-angeles-bird-lyft-lime-jump-tickets-lapd
Are scooters too dangerous for LA’s streets?,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,8,28,"Are scooters too dangerous for LA’s streets? In Los Angeles, riders must share lanes with cars—or face a $197 fine. At the intersection of Beverly and Fairfax, a man approaches a Lime scooter and quickly unlocks the device with his phone. After checking the brakes, he pushes the throttle forward, jumping gingerly off a curb and into the crosswalk. On the other side of the street he accelerates onto the sidewalk, riding right over a stenciled message: “No e-scooter riding on sidewalk—it’s the law.” These yellow-painted warnings were installed last month by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, at the behest of City Councilmember Paul Koretz, who last week announced the creation of a new task force to enforce laws barring users from riding scooters on sidewalks. A year ago, as Los Angeles officials ironed out a set of rules regulating the electric scooters companies had begun to deploy in city streets, Koretz called for an outright ban on the devices. Just over 12 months later, the city’s regulations are in full effect, and Koretz tells Curbed he’s “even more certain” that the scooters have no place in Los Angeles. “I just don’t think there’s a safe place to ride,” he says. Though many riders continue to use scooters on sidewalks, under local laws, those who don’t ride in the street are subject to a $197 ticket. Once in the roadway, scooter riders often must share lanes with cars, creating new hazards for users. “I’d rather have the rider put at risk because they’re the ones taking the scooters voluntarily, rather than the innocent pedestrians that are not volunteering to take a scooter knowing how unsafe they may be,” Koretz says. But just how dangerous are scooters? In a study released earlier this year, UCLA researchers found that from September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2018, almost 250 people visited two Westside emergency rooms with scooter-related injuries. Of these, nearly 92 percent were riders and just over 8 percent were non-riders struck by a scooter. Two patients—both riders—were injured severely enough to be admitted to intensive care. Since the study’s completion, two electric scooter users in the Los Angeles area (including one using a privately owned device) have been killed in traffic collisions. In the first eight months of 2019, emergency responders reported 167 scooter injuries in the city of Los Angeles, according to data provided by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Of those injured, 118 were transported to the hospital and 49 were treated on site. To put those numbers into context: During the same time period, emergency responders reported 1,096 bicycle-related injuries. Of those treated, 680 were transported to the hospital for further care. That discrepancy may simply be a reflection of the fact that scooters are still hard to find in many Los Angeles neighborhoods. “As much as they’ve disrupted the space, there’s probably fewer overall scooter riders,” says Eli Akira Kaufman, director of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. “The issue is no one really knows how many bicyclists are out there.” Personal injury attorney Catherine Lerer tells Curbed that, regardless of the sheer number of incidents, the injuries her clients have sustained riding scooters are “much worse” than those stemming from bicycle crashes. “Scooters don’t behave like bicycles,” she says. “The air-filled wheels of a bike have more give... even road paint can cause an e-scooter rider to wipe out.” Lerer says she’s spoken to at least 300 scooter injury victims since the devices began popping up on the sidewalks of Los Angeles and other cities. In October, her firm filed a class-action lawsuit against scooter companies Bird and Lime, alleging that some of these injuries—gruesomely detailed on the firm’s website—were the result of “gross negligence” on the part of the companies. A spokesperson from Bird says the company requires riders to complete in-app safety training before riding and that its newest scooters were “built with safety in mind” and “certified to the highest level of U.S. and international safety standards.” Lerer says the “vast majority” of scooter injuries she’s seen have been sustained in “single-vehicle accidents,” rather than collisions with cars or pedestrians. That’s backed up by data in the UCLA report indicating that 80 percent of injuries occurred when riders simply fell off their scooters. She says scooters are inherently dangerous, but riders could benefit from infrastructure that insulates scooters from pedestrians and motor vehicle traffic. “If you’re putting riders on the street next to cars, they need some form of protection,” Lerer says. Nationwide, at least 10 deaths reported in the media have been linked to scooter crashes since 2017. Of those, eight were instances in which riders were struck by an automobile. In Los Angeles, most of the 240 deaths that occurred on city streets in 2018 were the result of car crashes. “I think there’s been an over-focus on scooter safety and continued silence on how dangerous our roadways are for people walking or biking—because of cars—not scooters,” says Jessica Meaney, director of Investing in Place, an organization that advocates for safer streets. Meaney argues that city leaders seeking to protect scooter riders should focus on making space for them on city roadways. State laws require electric scooter users to ride in bike lanes on streets with speed limits over 25 miles per hour. But many of LA’s major traffic corridors don’t have bike lanes, and even fewer have protected lanes insulated from auto traffic. Kaufman’s organization has lobbied for years to change that. He says there are “more similarities than differences” between the needs of scooter riders and cyclists. “Those needs are safe, equitable streets,” he says. Koretz agrees that less auto-centric infrastructure could benefit scooter users. But he says political realities make it difficult to change the nature of the city’s streets. “We already built everything for cars,” he says. “It’s very hard for us to reverse. If you tried to put in a bike lane on Beverly Boulevard, for instance, there just isn’t the width for it. And if you had to put in a road diet to make room for the bike lanes, you would back up traffic so badly that people would want to have our heads on a rail.” Meaney says if local leaders are serious about reducing residents’ dependence on cars—a goal outlined in Mayor Eric Garcetti’s Green New Deal—they’ll find ways to make scooters work. “People should be allowed to make a choice between the transportation options that work for them on that day, for that trip,” she says. “City Hall should not be making that decision for them.”",https://la.curbed.com/2019/8/28/20835191/scooters-sidewalks-streets-safe-accidents
L.A. suspends Uber’s permit to rent out electric scooters and bikes,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,11,4,"L.A. suspends Uber’s permit to rent out electric scooters and bikes. Following months of conflict over a controversial data-sharing policy, Los Angeles has temporarily suspended Uber’s permit to rent electric scooters and bicycles on city streets and sidewalks. The company’s subsidiary, Jump, must appeal the decision by Friday or leave the city, the Transportation Department told the company in a letter last week. For now, customers can still rent the vivid red scooters and electric bikes through the Jump app. In response, Uber threatened in a letter to sue the city over the “patently unfair and improper” suspension. The letter also questioned the validity of the “eleventh-hour administrative review process” that the city created last month. “Every other company that is permitted in Los Angeles is following the rules,” said Transportation Department spokeswoman Connie Llanos. “We look forward to being able to work with Uber on getting them into compliance.” The suspension follows months of tension and failed attempts at compromise between Uber and the city over a data-sharing rule in L.A.'s one-year pilot permit program. Companies are required to transmit real-time data on all trips made within the city, including the start point, end point and travel time. Uber has resisted the rule for months, arguing, with the backing of several data privacy organizations, that the city’s policy constitutes government surveillance. With minimal analysis, they say, the information could easily reveal where people live, work, socialize or worship. Los Angeles officials have said the data are necessary to figure out which companies are flouting the permit program’s rules, including caps on the number of vehicles and bans on riding in certain areas. They have also argued that the companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. The eight companies with permits to operate in L.A. — including Uber, Bird, Lime and Lyft — manage a fleet of about 32,000 scooters and bikes that see about 1 million trips per month. The dispute highlights the lack of trust between cities and transportation companies that have typically moved into new markets without asking permission, working with local officials or sharing details on their operations. Companies such as Uber “generate and collect massive amounts of personal and financial data,” while the city “does not collect information specific to individual riders beyond trip information,” said Marcel Porras, the Transportation Department’s chief sustainability officer, in a letter to Uber last week. The data-sharing policies crafted in Los Angeles are now being overseen by a nonprofit organization, the Open Mobility Foundation. Its advocates hope the rules will serve as a framework to standardize data-sharing between governments and transportation companies. The Transportation Department has urged California regulators to adopt a similar framework for trips made in Uber and Lyft cars, which would reveal vast amounts of information on their operations statewide — data cities badly want to review, but that the companies have zealously guarded.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-04/los-angeles-suspends-uber-jump-scooters-bikes-data-privacy

Wants to Know Where Scooter Commuters Are Going. Uber Says That’s Government Surveillance. Angelenos used to zipping around the city on Uber’s fleet of electric scooters and bicycles may soon have to find alternative means of transportation (or, er, a different brand of scooter or bike) as Los Angeles and the company fail to come to terms on a data-sharing dispute that has been raging for months. The city has temporarily suspended Uber’s permit to rent the commuter-friendly rides, a move that will go into effect Friday unless Uber’s subsidiary company, Jump, appeals the decision, the Los Angeles Times reports. The transport giant and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation are facing off over regulations in L.A.’s one-year pilot program, which dictates that Uber must share renters’ user-data with the city in real time, including where trips start, end, and how long they take. Uber contends that sharing such private info constitutes “government surveillance” that could be used to track the movements and lifestyles of private citizens. Last week, Uber responded to an LADOT letter demanding compliance by threatening a lawsuit. “Independent privacy experts have clearly and repeatedly asserted that a customer’s geolocation is personally identifiable information, and—consistent with a recent legal opinion by the California legislative counsel—we believe that LADOT’s requirements to share sensitive on-trip data compromises our customers’ expectations of data privacy and security,” an Uber spokesperson said. But the city counters that, without the information, it can’t monitor whether companies like Uber, Lime, Lyft, and Bird—which dispatch a fleet of about 32,000 scooters and bikes, accounting for roughly a million rides per month—are obeying rules regarding how many vehicles they’re operating, and if they’re operating in prohibited areas. “Every other company that is permitted in Los Angeles is following the rules,” LADOT spokeswoman Connie Llanos said. “We look forward to being able to work with Uber on getting them into compliance.” This is yet another rough spot in the tumultuous relationship between L.A. and Uber, as the city’s ban on curbside rideshare pickups at LAX got off to a miserable start last week.",https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/uber-scooter-data-dispute/

An 88-year-old woman who tripped over a Lyft scooter in Santa Monica, fracturing her hip and elbow, is suing the city, the rideshare company, and the Santa Monica Community College District. According to the Santa Monica Daily Press, Dorothy “Dolly” Green was attending class at the Santa Monica Community College Emeritus, a school for older adults, when she tripped over a scooter parked in front of the school. Green sustained multiple fractures to her hip and elbow that required surgery, according to her first amended complaint. The victim’s daughter, Paula Green, says she was dropping her mother off at the school in September 2018 the day the incident occurred. When she pulled into a loading zone, she saw it was covered with scooters. “It was so crowded and she tried to get through there and somehow one of the scooters ended up catapulting her back into the street. She was on the floor. There was blood everywhere. Her arm is ripped to the bone,” Paula Green said. The “passenger loading only” zone in front of the school where her mother was dropped of was reported as being designated by the city as a “no deployment zone” for electric scooters. The fall came five days after the city launched a Shared Mobility Pilot Program, that allowed electric scooter and bike rental companies Lyft, Bird, Lime and Uber’s Jump, to deploy scooters and bikes in Santa Monica. According to SMDP, the complaint alleged that Lyft and the city were negligent and created a public nuisance in allowing scooters to be parked in front of a loading zone in front of a school for the elderly after designating the area as a “no deployment zone,” and asked for at least $500,000 in damages. “Ms. Green suffered five fractures in her pelvis. Her quality of life and independence have dramatically changed as a result of her injuries,” said Green’s attorney Catherine Lerer. “The responsible parties must pay for the harm caused.” Lyft and the city opposed the complaint but were overruled in Los Angeles Superior Court. “(The city) argues it is immune from liability because the decision to impound or not impound a scooter is a policy decision. The court disagrees,” Los Angeles Superior Court’s Theresa Traber. “This decision is not a basic policy decision. Rather, this decision is an operational decision.” Spokespersons for the City of Santa Monica and Lyft had not responded to requests for comment at the time of this report.",https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/11/12/87-year-old-woman-who-tripped-over-lyft-scooter-fracturing-hip-sues-lyft-and-city-of-santa-monica/
Uber will challenge L.A.’s suspension of its permit to rent out scooters and bikes,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,11,12,"Uber will challenge L.A.’s suspension of its permit to rent out scooters and bikes. Setting the stage for a possible legal showdown, Uber has appealed Los Angeles’s decision to suspend its permit to rent out electric scooters and bikes. Uber’s subsidiary, Jump, filed a request Friday for a hearing that will determine whether the company will be forced to remove its red scooters and electric bikes from L.A.'s streets and sidewalks. Jump bikes and scooters will be available for rent until the hearing concludes. The hearing date has not been scheduled. Los Angeles suspended Uber’s operating permit at the end of October after months of tension and failed attempts at compromise over a new data-sharing rule included in the city’s pilot permit program for electric bike and scooter rentals. The rule requires that companies transmit data on the start point and end point of each scooter or bike trip in real time, and share the route taken within 24 hours of the trip ending. The real-time data sharing requirement makes Los Angeles “an outlier among hundreds of cities around the world,” said Uber spokesman Davis White in a statement. “The city could say the same thing about Uber,” said Transportation Department spokeswoman Connie Llanos. “They’re an outlier because every other company we have operating in the city right now is following our guidelines.” Eight companies have permits to operate scooters and electric bikes in L.A., including Uber, Bird, Lime and Lyft. They collectively oversee a fleet of about 32,000 vehicles that make about 1 million trips per month. Los Angeles officials have said obtaining the data is necessary to determine which companies are flouting the permit program’s rules, including caps on the number of vehicles and bans on riding in certain areas. They have also argued that the companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. The Silicon Valley giant has resisted the rule for months, arguing that sharing real-time information on trips constitutes government surveillance. Although the data does not include the names of customers, the trip data could reveal identifiable information — including where people live, work, socialize or worship — with minimal analysis, the company has argued. The city’s “misguided technique poses serious risks to consumer privacy,” White said. Several data privacy organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, have backed Uber’s argument. Uber, Llanos said, is “collecting way more data than what the city is asking for.” The data will be classified as sensitive and confidential, she said, which means it will not be readily available to the public, though it could be revealed in response to a subpoena. Uber’s hearing will be conducted by an officer from the city’s Department of Cannabis Regulation. The officer will be selected “via random draw” from a list of on-call employees, the Transportation Department said in a letter earlier this month. The department made that choice “on the advice of the city attorney” and to expedite the hearing process, Llanos said. During the permit program’s pilot phase, she said, officials are studying the process of appeals for the city’s nine franchised taxi companies, as well as in other city departments that are “handling more recent issues,” including cannabis.

Bird scooters enters the helmet discussion with free rides for those taking helmet-wearing selfies,Long Beach Post,,"Los Angeles, CA",2019,11,19,"Bird scooters enters the helmet discussion with free rides for those taking helmet-wearing selfies. In an effort to boost safety, Santa Monica-based scooter company Bird will offer ride credits to users who take a selfie while wearing a helmet. This is not the first time the company has delved into trying to get its users to wear helmets: It has given away 75,000 helmets across Santa Monica and Los Angeles but data later showed that few actually put them when hopping on a scooter. The helmet discussion is a complicated one and becomes even more compounded when scooters are thrown into the mix. On one hand, they save lives in accidents involving head trauma; on the other hand, they actually prevent folks from using alternative or healthier forms of transit, especially biking. On this last point, the more bicyclists there are, the more drivers learn how to drive more safely around them. According to a study by the European Cycling Federation, countries with lower amounts of cyclists have higher rates of accidents. The Netherlands had witnessed a 45% increase in cycling and a 58% decrease in fatalities between 1980 and 2005—and also, their riders who wear helmets? That accounts for 0.1% of Netherlands’ cyclists. In other words, as the report states, safety lies in numbers, not mandated garb. It is much like suggesting drivers wear helmets: It will surely increase their safety but lowering speed limits and increasing awareness through road design is far more efficient. But scooters are different than bikes: Biking isn’t especially dangerous in terms of head trauma, possibly making the protection value of helmets overstated. Scooters, however, very much are: Traveling at a consistent 15 mph with nothing more than the push of a button (and some users saying they’ve reached over 20 mph on some with illegal tinkering), head injuries are one of the most common injuries reported in scooter accidents, according to research from Austin’s Health Department. Despite this caveat between bicycling and scooting, it is likely that experts will argue for scooters the way they did for bicycling: Helmet laws are rendered moot if protected infrastructure and decreased speed limits are lacking.",https://lbpost.com/longbeachize/addison-bird-scooters-helmet
L.A. wins appeal in fight with Uber over scooter and bike data,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,2,11,"L.A. wins appeal in fight with Uber over scooter and bike data. Los Angeles officials were right to suspend Uber’s permit to rent out scooters and electric bicycles in the city because the company refused to share real-time data on its riders’ trips, a hearing officer found Tuesday. The 13-page decision is a blow to Uber’s subsidiary Jump, which has been fighting for more than a year against a data-sharing rule imposed by the city’s Transportation Department. Uber spokesman Davis White said the company will appeal the decision. For now, customers can still rent the vivid red scooters and electric bikes through the Jump app. “We have been clear for months that we have serious privacy concerns about LADOT’s requirements to collect real-time, individual trip data on our riders in Los Angeles,” White said. “We believe that best in class data aggregation methods could deliver LADOT near-real time data — while protecting the identity of Los Angeles residents and our riders.” The city requires that companies transmit real-time data on the start point and end point of each trip, and the full route of each ride within a day. Uber has refused to comply, arguing that the data could easily be used to reveal personal information about riders, including where they live, work, socialize or worship. In a statement, Transportation Department spokeswoman Connie Llanos said the decision “upholds the city’s common sense permit requirements, designed to protect the safety and quality of life for local residents.” The data is used to determine which companies are flouting the permit program’s rules, including flooding some neighborhoods with vehicles and leaving scooters parked in areas where they shouldn’t be, the city has said. Officials have also argued that the companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. The city’s one-year permit program ends March 15.

Shapiro, a lawyer who has handled appeals for multiple city departments, including the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Department of Cannabis Regulation. In his decision, Shapiro wrote that the Transportation Department had “properly suspended” Uber’s permit for violating the city’s data submission rules. The company had applied for a permit voluntarily, he wrote, and had “the ability to withdraw or omit its application at any time.” But both sides, he said, had weak points in their arguments: Uber’s attorneys did not provide examples of scooter data being used to personally identify a rider, he said, “although the abstract concern is real.” The city, he said, did not explain what problems could be prevented or solved with data that is reported within five seconds.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-11/uber-jump-bikes-scooters-permit-ladot-data-fight-ruling
Where did all the scooters go?,Curbed LA,Curbed,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,3,2,"Where did all the scooters go? Since the summer, the number of scooter riders has been cut in half. On a quiet stretch of Rose Avenue, people seated outside a cafe sip coffee and squint in the morning sunlight as a surfer pedals by with a board affixed to his bicycle. Across the street, a few electric scooters are positioned in a neat row. Another small cluster is neatly arranged down the block. None have toppled over and all appear to be in good condition. The storm drains are clear of transportation devices; the sidewalks are clear of riders. Can this really be Venice? Just two years ago, companies like Bird and Lime were saturating Los Angeles’s Westside communities with the zippy, easy-to-rent scooters that can now be found in neighborhoods across the city. Now, nearly a year into a pilot program regulating the devices citywide, the scooters are noticeably less ubiquitous. In some neighborhoods, they’re downright scarce. Scooter companies maintain that a rollback of the number of vehicles available is due to low demand in the winter months. But industry analysts say a competitive market and local regulations have also stemmed the proliferation of the devices—for better or worse. “There is some level of novelty, but I don’t think what we’re seeing is some rebirth of the Segway and all the hype around that,” says James Gross, co-founder of Micromobility Industries. The eight companies permitted to deploy electric scooters and bikes in LA scattered an average of 12,776 vehicles around the city on any given day in December, according to a new report from the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Compare that to September 2018, when the Los Angeles City Council voted to regulate the vehicles. At that time, just one of those companies—Bird—was reportedly deploying as many as 15,000 scooters. In July 2019, an average of 26,782 vehicles could be found throughout the city. The reduction in the final months of the year corresponds with a drop in ridership. More than 1.2 million vehicle rentals were recorded in August; by December, that number had fallen to 575,748. Industry experts agree that a dip in rider interest can be expected during the winter. Bike and scooter companies even plan for it. “During winter months, we experience slower ridership throughout the city,” says a Lime spokesperson in a statement. “As a result, we reduce our operations to meet demand, something we typically do in markets around the world that experience seasonal changes. We look forward to ramping back up in the spring.” But the devices also appear to be attracting a relatively small concentration of riders. In a recent survey of more than 1,800 Los Angeles County residents, researchers from the University of Southern California found that less than 6 percent of respondents had even tried an electric scooter or bicycle. Just 2 percent rode at least once a week. Study author and sociologist Kyla Thomas says “lack of availability” appears to be one of the main reasons most residents aren’t riding the devices. More than half of survey respondents said it was “difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to find the vehicles in their neighborhoods. Gross says Los Angeles’s permitting fees, which range from $39 to $130 per vehicle, may be hampering the proliferation of bikes and scooters throughout the city. Investor reports from Bird and Lime show that operating costs for the vehicles often come close to exceeding the prices paid by riders. Any additional expenses make it harder to justify the expense of charging and maintaining a fleet of scooters in a given area. Gross says investors in these relatively new companies are already becoming eager to see the startups become profitable—something that could threaten the entire industry in the long-run. “No matter how much a fire is raging, if you cut out the oxygen, you will kill the fire,” he says. He argues that cities should be subsidizing, rather than strictly regulating, new mobility devices that provide a more climate-friendly alternative to driving. That could be a tough sell in Los Angeles, where the appearance of scooters two years ago provoked furious protests from residents concerned about sidewalk accessibility and safety. One member of the City Council went so far as to propose a blanket ban on the devices. Another City Councilmember, Joe Buscaino, welcomed scooters to the Harbor area. Now, those neighborhoods have become something of a dead zone. According to city data, between April and December, operators distributed an average of just 36 vehicles per day in the 15th council district, which includes San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, and Watts. Buscaino spokesperson Branimir Kvartuc says the councilmember is “annoyed that the scooters have diminished in the harbor area,” but speculates that the region might not have a high enough population density to support a large number of devices. Citywide, just seven neighborhoods—Downtown, Exposition Park, Koreatown, Hollywood, Beverly Grove, Westwood, and Venice—accounted for more than half of all rides between August and December, an analysis of transportation department data reveals. Regina Clewlow, CEO of mobility data firm Populus, says that Los Angeles’s daily ridership numbers are low, compared to other cities where electric bikes and scooters are available. Bikes and scooters were typically rented 1.5 times per day in December. A 2019 report from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency found that scooters in the Bay Area city averaged between two and three rides per day even in rainy winter months. Clewlow says this suggests there may be “too many vehicles or too many operators (or both)” in Los Angeles, making the city a competitive environment for these businesses. Gross says after disappointing Wall Street debuts from Uber and Lyft (both now in the bike and scooter business), the clock is ticking for other mobility startups to show a path to profitability. “You’ll most likely see companies go out of business because of what’s happening in the market,” he says.

Lime will remove its scooters from California and other states due to coronavirus,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,3,18,"Lime will remove its scooters from California and other states due to coronavirus. Lime is pulling its shared electric scooters from 20 countries and 21 states, including California, as the number of COVID-19 cases spread across the world. Scooters will be pulled from California, Texas, New York and other U.S. states, as well as from most of Europe, including France, Spain, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom. In a statement Wednesday, Chief Executive and founder Brad Bao said that Lime will “begin winding down and pausing our service to reflect public health guidance.” “Like you, we are worried about the cities we love and call home, the people we serve, and our colleagues on the ground,” Bao said. “Loving cities means protecting them too. For now, we’re pausing Lime service to help people stay put and stay safe.” The company is the first major scooter provider to halt service in California. The timing reflects the rapidly changing response to coronavirus in the United States. Two days ago, when Lime scooters were still available in every U.S. market, the company’s head of global safety told riders to consider wearing gloves and to wash their hands before and after riding. The timing of the pandemic could pose major revenue problems for scooter companies, which see business contract in the winter and expand again when the weather gets nicer. Lime said “all parts of the scooter that are touched by people” are being cleaned. Mechanics and field operators are required to wear gloves, the company said, and hand sanitizer is being distributed to workers in warehouses. As of Wednesday morning, Lime was still operating in Denver, Miami, Tampa and Orlando, Fla., and Washington, D.C., but “will continue to adjust our operations as appropriate,” Bao said. Most private systems and several publicly owned bike-share services are still operating, including L.A. Metro’s bike share, Metro Bike, and Santa Monica’s Breeze system. For the next month, Breeze is waiving all fees for rides up to 90 minutes. The discount is available to prepaid monthly pass holders and pay-as-you-go users, according to the program’s Twitter account. The decision by the city-owned service was made to “ensure the availability of reliable transportation options through this uncertain time for essential trips outside the home,” a Breeze representative said. Before and after riding a scooter, every scooter provider said, follow the advice of public health officials and wash your hands.",https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-18/lime-scooters-california-coronavirus-covid19-jump-bikes-breeze-bikeshare
Bird cuts 30% of workforce as coronavirus pushes scooters out of cities,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,3,27,"Bird cuts 30% of workforce as coronavirus pushes scooters out of cities. Dockless scooter companies charged into cities in 2018, promising a mobility revolution with cheap, clean rides and billions of dollars in venture capital backing. Yet they soon faced roadblocks, including shaky business models, safety concerns and fast-moving city regulators. At the start of 2020, cash-losing operators were shrinking their headcounts and vehicle fleets. Now as governments around the world fight to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the companies are facing a deeper existential challenge. The two largest, Lime and Bird, drastically reduced fleets by mid-March. Santa Monica-based Bird began major layoffs Friday, cutting 30% of its workforce “due to the financial and operational impact” of the pandemic, according to an internal memo from Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden. “We just raised hundreds of millions from investors,” VanderZanden wrote, “but given all the uncertainty, we needed to ensure a cash runway to last through the end of 2021.” Several other start-ups, including Wheels and Uber-owned Jump, say they’re looking at how to keep operating as people are ordered to stay at home and rider demand plummets. The appeal of sharing a high-touch vehicle with an unknown number of strangers has succumbed to the fear of viral transmission. Lime CEO and co-founder Brad Bao wrote in a blog post on March 21 that the startup is “winding down or pausing” service in all markets but South Korea. Prior to the pandemic, the company operated nearly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries across the Americas and Europe. Bird announced it is removing its fleets in six U.S. cities: Sacramento; San Francisco; San Jose; Portland, Ore.; Miami and Coral Gables, Fla. It had already pulled vehicles from 21 European cities. Jump has paused electric bike and scooter rentals in most of its European markets and trimmed the size of its fleets across the U.S. It stopped service entirely in Sacramento at the city’s request. Lyft Inc. has continued to operate its network of mostly docked bikeshare systems in eight U.S. markets. So far, it’s kept dockless scooters available for rent in all urban markets but Miami. Every company with vehicles in circulation said that they have heightened their handlebar sanitation protocols and are encouraging riders to do the same. The sudden disappearance of scooters and e-bikes comes after months of industry turbulence. Bird and Lime have struggled to raise money from investors, and both cut staff starting late last year. The companies, once singularly focused on growth, have realized their problematic business plans need rethinking. Last year, talks of an acquisition of Bird or Lime by Uber didn’t pan out. Some industry watchers said the eye-popping valuations of each — in 2019, Bird and Lime hit $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively — were a factor. The Information reported Thursday that layoffs are now imminent at Lime, as it seeks emergency funding at a valuation of just $400 million. (A Lime communications officer denied that layoffs are coming.) Uber and Lyft, both of which went public in 2019, conducted layoffs in their own micromobility divisions late last year, and both recently pulled dockless vehicles from several markets. Wheels and Lime say ridership was rising before the start of widespread social distancing. The decisions to reduce urban fleets now have been motivated largely by a sense of responsibility for the health of their riders and workers who maintain the vehicles, Lime and Bird say. The economics of the business is also an undeniable factor, said David Spielfogel, Lime’s chief policy officer. “If everyone is sheltering in place and not moving around, the business is no longer sustainable,” he said. Tourists, which generate significant scooter ridership in many cities, have also vanished from most markets. While there may be ways for Lime to generate revenue during the crisis, that’s not a priority while people are at home, and “governments are trying to get the virus under control,” Spielfogel said. Many investors, already skeptical about the viability of the e-scooter business, say the current situation could be the nail in the industry’s coffin. “I’ve heard a number of people compare the plight of the scooter companies to Uber and Lyft. Like them, scooters are seeing plummeting usage,” says Aaron Michel, a partner at the early-stage venture capital firm 1984 Ventures, which has no investments in the micromobility space. “Unlike Uber and Lyft, though, the verdict was pretty much in on the scooter industry before the virus arrived.” Companies without major backers will go under, he expects, while deeper-pocketed businesses will pare back to bare minimums. Emily Castor Warren, a principal and director of policy at the transportation planning firm Nelson\Nygaard and a former director of policy at both Lyft and Lime, agreed that the pandemic could be a death knell for scooter businesses with large overhead costs, especially those that were already in an uncertain financial position. “I think it’s pretty dire,” she says. “If these lockdowns persist, they’re going to have to, at the very least, undertake major layoffs to core teams, because the one cost they can’t bring down to zero is salaries for headcount and real estate for their offices.” The short-term outlook may not be so precarious for every micromobility company. Wheels, a startup that operates dockless electric minibikes in 17 cities in Europe and the U.S., raised $50 million in October in a funding round led by DBL Partners. The company announced on March 27 that it will roll out vehicles with self-cleaning handlebars and brake levers that can be used for delivery services and other essential uses, while its shared bikes are suspended until the end of March. The company has partnered with NanoSeptic, which has developed the self-cleaning surface. The technology uses mineral nano-crystals that continuously oxidize organic contaminants. Scooter operator Spin hasn’t felt the same capital pressure as some of its peers — it’s owned by the Ford Motor Co. Until this week, Spin was the sole scooter provider to maintain normal operations — in its case, serving 66 U.S. cities and 12 college campuses—but it changed course on Tuesday. The company will retain scooters only in Austin; Baltimore; Denver; Detroit; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Tampa; and Washington, D.C. “We have made the decision to pause our operations, as of today, in all other cities due to significant demand drop off as communities combat the fast-spreading virus,” the company’s co-founders wrote in a Medium post. “This pause will remain in effect until further notice.” Spin’s communications staff couldn’t clarify which specific markets would be losing vehicles, and Ford’s communications team rebuffed multiple requests for interviews with executives. Molly Turner, a lecturer in business and public policy at UC Berkeley and an advisor to technology startups including Spin, said the cities the company is continuing to serve may indicate where it’s had the greatest financial success to date. The markets Spin is pulling out of may show “where scooters weren’t a viable business or didn’t have enough penetration to succeed without the special partnerships or promotions that are impossible right now,” she says. That may be the case for all companies in question, as travel right now, no matter the mode of transportation, has come to a near standstill. Several scooter operators, including Jump, Lime, Spin and Wheels, are considering opportunities to partner with local governments or essential service providers as a way to continue operations, as residents avoid buses, trains and other public transit under shelter-in-place mandates. New York City saw ridership on its Citi Bike system jump 67% in mid-March, after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced social distancing guidelines. On March 21, ridership on the city’s subway, the nation’s largest mass transit system, was down 87% from the same time last year. Some investors view the decline in transit use as one reason for optimism about the midterm prospects for micromobility. Assuming commuters remain skittish about crowding into buses and subway cars after the shelter-in-place orders lift, scooter and e-bike companies could take the opening to push for looser regulations and the reversal of the scooter bans ordered in some world cities, says Bradley Tusk, a co-founder and managing partner of Tusk Ventures and an investor in Bird. “With warming weather, better needs, and arguments for legalization and less saturated markets, [and] with companies like Lime contracting, there’s a legitimate opportunity over the next 3-6 months,” he wrote in an email. An additional upside could come in selling or leasing scooters and e-bikes directly to riders, says Niko Bonatsos, managing director at General Catalyst, an early-stage venture capital fund that hasn’t invested in dockless rentals. “Right now we hate each other and can’t stand each other’s company, and getting an Uber or grabbing someone else’s shared scooter might not be the best idea,” he said. “But if you have your own bike, now is the time to use it.” Bird offers a monthly leasing program, as does the electric moped startup Zebra. For cities that have come to value shared micromobility services as a sustainable transportation option, subsidizing them may be the only way to secure their existence long-term, Castor Warren says. Some traditional docked bikeshare systems, including those in Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., are owned by local governments but operated by Lyft. “In that model the city has more ability to ensure continuity of operations and ensure that service will be provided to the public, because they’ve extended their own resources, even if the bottom falls out of the economy,” she says. Such a scenario would prove what skeptics have said about dockless scooters and ride-hailing companies from the start. History has shown that establishing a new transportation service often requires massive subsidies from investors or governments. For now, even though they may be allowed to continue to operate in many cities, the scooter companies are going it alone. Says Turner: “They’re not getting a bailout from Congress.”",https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-27/bird-scooter-layoffs-coronavirus
Can L.A.’s Scooter Craze Survive the Pandemic?,LA Magazine,Hour Media Group,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,5,26,"Can L.A.’s Scooter Craze Survive the Pandemic? A year ago Los Angeles embarked upon the nation’s largest experiment in micromobility. Hoping to ease traffic and reduce emissions, the city’s Department of Transportation granted permits to Bird, Lime, Spin, and five other companies to operate 37,000 scooters on L.A.’s streets. Until early March, the program seemed to be working and was on track to log 10 million rides in the project’s first year. Then came COVID-19, stay-at-home orders, and Angelenos’ reluctance to touch anything anyone else had touched. As of mid-April just 700 scooters were operating within city limits, with rides hovering around 1,000 or fewer trips a day, according to LADOT. Lime and Wheels temporarily suspended operations, and Bird recently laid off 30 percent of its staff. Santa Monica, home to Bird’s headquarters, and the city that started the scooter craze in September 2017, has seen a 90 percent decline in ridership and an 84 percent drop in deployed scooters, from 2,500 to 400, since the stay-at-home order went into effect in March. The fleet reduction is mostly a strategic response to reduced demand, but the move was also made “to help discourage non-critical mobility and to help flatten the curve,” Bird said in a statement to Los Angeles, adding that it intends to “offer our full fleet as soon as possible. The scooter companies that remain in operation have stepped up their sanitization procedures and are offering free rides to frontline workers. The looming question is whether the industry will be able to return to its go-go days once the pandemic is under control. The health crisis “has exposed the business model,” says Juan Matute, deputy director of UCLA’s Institute for Transportation Studies. Bird has seen a 90 percent decline in ridership since March. Starting in early 2018 companies from Bird to Bolt drew?investment with unit-economics-based plans to place scooters in areas where they would?be used frequently enough to cover costs and turn a profit. For the math to work, Matute says, a scooter needs to be ridden at least three times a day for an average trip of 12 minutes. “The challenge, and why they haven’t been making money,” Matute says, “is that companies have invested extraordinary amounts expanding into areas where there’s not going to be as much demand.” In other words, cities out side of balmy Southern California.?Lime pulled out of all 100 markets in which it had been operating, except for two cities in South Korea, after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global emergency. Now the company is looking to that country for clues about what the business might look like in a post-quarantine world. “We continue to explore options as the new normal evolves,” says Katie Stevens, head of global policy for San Francisco-based Lime.? Stevens says ridership dropped in South Korea when confirmed cases were at their height, but the company is now seeing even higher usage as people look for transportation that allows for social distancing. Reports out of China indicate a similar trend of increased demand for micromobility as fewer people risk mass transit. With the pandemic still active in L.A., it’s too early to tell how a scooter recovery could play out here. But with so many companies offering the same service, “the likelihood is that a number of companies will go under,” says Aaron Michel, a partner at the investment firm 1984 Ventures. “The ones with deep pockets will hibernate. And the companies that own them—the Fords, the Ubers, the Lyfts—will have to take a hard look at whether unit economics justify these businesses after this is all over.” The companies that do survive will have to evolve. “The whole industry is undergoing a giant evolution,” says Kyle Kozar, a senior transportation planner for Santa Monica. What started as publicly funded and operated bike-share services turned into privately operated, venture-capital-funded scooters that companies like Bird dumped onto public streets by the thousands without consulting municipal governments. “Now I think it’s going to be pivoting back more toward [a] relationship with cities,” Kozar says, with scooters working more like a bike-share program administered through a public transit agency. “This crisis has demonstrated that transportation is the connective tissue required to keep essential services running,” says LADOT spokesman Colin Sweeney. We’re about to see exactly what that will look like.",https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/scooter-bird-pandemic/
Electric Scooters Impatient To Return To Long Beach ,The Grunion,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,6,26,"Electric Scooters Impatient To Return To Long Beach. One of the hottest topics in Long Beach last year, before the coronavirus pandemic, was electric scooters. After more than a year of a pilot program, the City Council finally approved a permanent approach in May 2019. Public Works officials began crafting regulations, but they weren't complete on the target date in November 2019. Then in March 2020, the world changed. The city asked scooter companies on March 31 to pull the scooters from the street, fearing they might spread the coronavirus. Now, like every other business owner in the country, the scooter company officials are itching to reopen. ""We were classified as essential as a form of transportation,"" Tim Harter said. Harter is in charge of government partnerships for the Bird scooter company. ""But for the last two months, we haven't been able to restart. The city's health order didn't take into account the micro-mobility sector."" City officials say it was more than what was or wasn't in the city's health order that kept the scooters out of the city. Work on the permanent regulations was put on hold while the focus. was on the. pandemic, then the open streets initiative the City Council and mayor pushed through early this month. ""We are in the final stages of the review now,"" said Jennifer Carey, Public Works community relations officer. ""We're back and focused. We expect the permanent program to be in place in 30 to 60 days."" Carey said the city had reached out to vendors — Bird is one of five operating in the pilot period — last week. Ways to sanitize the scooters is a key to returning to operation, she said. Scooters operate as a shared mode of transportation. Once a person is done using a scooter, it is left where someone else could use it — companies pick them up when they need to be recharged or for maintenance. ""Sanitation is the reason we had to pull the scooters in the first place,"" Carey said. ""It was the same as the bike share program."" Harter said Bird has taken the sanitation issue into account. ""Their concern is the spread of COVID,"" he said. ""We will be regularly cleaning the handlebars and the rest. We'll also be encouraging our riders to be safe, use proper hygiene, no double rides, etc."" Company officials later said it is true scooters couldn't be sterilized after every ride. There would be frequent field cleaning, and sanitization every charge or maintenance session, though. ""We're seeing positive trends (with the pandemic),"" Harter said. ""We wanted to help — offer free rides to essential health workers and the like — but we weren't able to. Now people are looking for (transportation) options again."" Another sticking point, Harter said, is the Long Beach requirement to pay the fee of $100 a scooter per year at the beginning of the year. Other cities have opted to collect a per ride fee, allowing scooter companies to pay the city. as money for the service comes in. ""We're ready to put 300 (the maximum allowed during the pilot period for each company) out; we're ready to put 500 out, we're ready to put 1,000 out after six months,"" Harter said. ""But at $100 a pop, that's a significant amount of money to lay out in advance… We want the city to consider trip fees, maybe 10 cents a ride. Others have done that."" Carey said the Public Works Department had heard the request, but were committed to following the program as passed by the City Council — with the flat fee. ""But we realize that is a significant hit if it is paid all at once,"" she said. ""So we have made an offer to accept quarterly payments… We expect that within the next 30 to 60 days that the program will be up and the scooters will be fully. deployed."" A list of the other scooter companies still planning to come back to Long Beach was not available. Those participating in the pilot program in addition to Bird were Lime, Spin, Skip and Razor. Up to six companies will be allowed under the permanent program.",https://www.gazettes.com/news/business/electric-scooters-impatient-to-return-to-long-beach/article_0f7d358e-b4d7-11ea-bf46-6fe8377076e8.html
"Dockless scooter, bike companies get 3-month reprieve from stricter regulations in LA ",Los Angeles Daily News,MediaNews,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,8,6,"Dockless scooter, bike companies get 3-month reprieve from stricter regulations in LA. Company officials support city's goal to 'penalize bad actors and incentizive good partners' to deal with issues in its micro-mobility program. Los Angeles’ cavalcade of dockless scooters and bikes will avoid stricter requirements, including new fees and a requirement for locks, at least until the end of the year while the Los Angeles Department of Transportation irons out several key regulations for the fledgling industry. The Los Angeles City Council’s transportation committee technically approved a series of proposed regulations by the LADOT this week, but it delayed the rollout until Dec. 31 and sent the toughest rules back to the drawing board in the meantime. Now, the same companies that were opposing the proposal are optimistic the extra time will allow them to negotiate a middle ground. In a statement, Lyft praised the council members’ delay. “While we were disappointed that LADOT’s plan did not take into account many of our concerns and feedback, we are looking forward to working with the Council and LADOT staff over the next three months,” Lyft said in a statement. Phuong Bui, the government partnerships manager for Spin, said the company supports the city’s goal to “penalize bad actors and incentizive good partners” and called it a move in the right direction. Unequal distribution in neighborhoods LADOT originally took a softer approach to regulations in the first year of its “micro-mobility” pilot program, but too few of the companies took advantage of incentives to deploy in low-income neighborhoods and instead oversaturated the streets of Venice, Hollywood and downtown. Residents complained of scooters left haphazardly on sidewalks, tossed in trees and abandoned on private property. Some neighborhoods never saw the vehicles at all. “There was not really a shared deep commitment to achieve those equity outcomes,” said Seleta Reynolds, LADOT’s general manager, at Wednesday’s committee meeting. The city offered a “basket of carrots,” but found that without strong punishments, companies chose to ignore large swaths of the city, she said. Nearly a quarter of the riders during the pilot program made $100,000 or more a year, according to a one-year review. The review also found just 2% of all trips started or ended in the San Fernando Valley. Response times for service requests — 90% of which were related to improperly parked vehicles — were nearly four hours longer in the Valley than the averages elsewhere, according to the report. Punishment drove compliance But the department’s new regulations in response to the program’s first year leaned too heavily on punishments, at least according to the providers. Fines for failure to meet the proposed regulations scale up to $100,000 under the proposed rules. Three particular areas were targeted by the companies as potentially damaging to the industry. First, a requirement to retrofit vehicles to lock to any bike rack within the next six months would cost the companies “millions,” they said, though the city wouldn’t have the necessary infrastructure in place by the deadline. LADOT said the requirement was phased for a reason, so companies could prepare for the inevitable shift in advance. Getting riders to properly comply with that requirement likely would present an additional challenge. While 82% of riders knew not to ride on the sidewalk, a third still preferred to do exactly that, according to the city’s one-year review. Roughly 85 percent of all citations related to the program as of March 2020 were for riding on the sidewalk. At the same time, less than half of the vehicles audited during the review period were parked correctly The second controversial rule would have established a “per ride” permit fee that charged operators nothing to deploy in the most economically challenged neighborhoods and up to 40 cents per ride in popular destinations. Representatives of the companies praised the per-ride fee, but they believed the tiers were too confusing and the fees were too high. Some asked for a flat fee of 10 to 20 cents across the board instead. Previously, the city charged $39 to $130 upfront per vehicle depending on its deployment location. Third, the companies opposed a hard cap that limited the costs to riders to $1.25 to $1.75 in low-income and transportation deficient areas. The micro-mobility companies argued they do not receive the heavy subsidies given to other more traditional transportation services and would have to operate at a loss in those areas. “It is our position that the current proposal, as it stands, creates an unfavorable policy environment that dramatically reduces the sustainability of operators in the market,” the companies Bird, Lyft, Lime and Wheels said in a joint letter ahead of the meeting. They alleged they were left out of the rule-making process and asked for a six-month extension of the existing rules. They got a little more than half that instead. The transportation committee asked the LADOT to review the lock requirement for other possible alternatives — such as an anti-tipping technology — and the fare caps to determine if a requirement to enroll a certain amount of individuals in a discounted ridership program might be more effective at achieving the department’s equity goals. ‘Equity zones’ The committee also pushed LADOT to come back with clearer boundaries in its “equity zones,” the disadvantaged areas where the lower fees and fares would come into effect under the proposal. Currently, the zones include areas such as protected wetlands, where increased ridership is unnecessary. Sam Sadle, the government relations lead for Lime in North America, said he’s optimistic his company and the other providers can work with the city over the next few months to create a framework that accomplishes everyone’s goals. He acknowledged the industry could have done a better job at providing services in the communities severely lacking in transportation options. Lime offers a 70 percent discount on memberships for low-income individuals and other companies, such as Spin, offer similar discounts. However, in its review of the first year, LADOT found programs like this were largely unknown to the people who qualified. “This is a new industry,” Sadle said. “I think we’ve learned a lot and still have more to learn. It is on us to do a better job and we’re committed to doing that.”",https://www.dailynews.com/dockless-scooter-bike-companies-get-3-month-reprieve-from-stricter-regulations-in-la
Unagi Launches New Subscription Scooter Service in LA,Spectrum News LA,Spectrum News,"Los Angeles, CA",2020,8,6,"Unagi Launches New Subscription Scooter Service in LA. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic and negative effect on shared mobility of all kinds, from public transit, to ride-hails such as Lyft and Uber, to on-demand scooters. But some companies are leveraging consumer preferences for touchless, socially distanced transportation to their advantage. On Wednesday, the electric scooter startup Unagi began offering a new subscription service in Los Angeles. Instead of renting scooters on demand by the minute, the company lets riders have a scooter all to themselves through its month-to-month rental program, Unagi All-Access. For $39 monthly, and a $50 initial set up fee, riders receive a fully assembled electric Model One from the Oakland startup delivered to their doorsteps within 24 hours, after which they can ride anywhere its two wheels can take them. What You Need To Know Unagi is a high-performance electric scooter maker based in Oakland, Calif. On Wednesday, the company launched its Unagi All-Access subscription service in Los Angeles For a $39 monthly fee, and $50 initial set up charge, riders receive a fully assembled electric Model One scooter delivered to their doorstep within 24 hours The monthly subscription includes unlimited miles, maintenance, and insurance “There’s a general movement toward access over ownership,” said Unagi founder and chief executive, David Hyman, citing the success of subscription services for everything from beauty products to food to cars. About a third of the $45 billion scooter market is inclined toward subscription, according to a survey Unagi did with the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley last year. And that trend is only accelerating during the pandemic. “There’s been a seismic shift to personal transportation,” Hyman said. “People don’t want to go on public transportation or get in a shared Uber or Lyft, and they don’t want to touch a rideshare scooter on the street.” In Los Angeles, ridership on Metro is currently down 50 percent, and scooter ridership is roughly a quarter of what it was a year ago, according to the L.A. Department of Transportation. In 2019, Los Angeles was home to the country’s largest electric scooter pilot program. Eight different companies were operating more than 36,000 scooters on city streets, and they were on track to log roughly 19 million scooter rides during the program’s first year. Today, the program is down to six companies and 225,000 daily trips. “Los Angeles is the epicenter of scooter culture,” said Hyman, who is simultaneously launching Unagi All-Access in L.A. and New York City. “When you go to Santa Monica or Venice, you couldn’t take two steps without falling over a scooter share, so we just wanted to start with the place where we felt like we’re going to have the most success.” Bird, based in Santa Monica, first set the scooter craze aflight in 2017 and had, at one point, dabbled in subscriptions. While that program is no longer available, Bird is offering its Bird One scooter for outright sale, in addition to its by-the-minute rentals. Unagi started two years ago with the idea of developing the Tesla of electric scooters – one that people would buy rather than rent. A high-performance scooter designed to be powerful, portable and agile, it’s made from lightweight carbon fiber and aluminum and is fitted with motors in both wheels, for better acceleration. “From our very beginning, our model was always around personal possession,” said Hyman, who started the company with $250,000 he raised on Kickstarter and has continued to build the company with $5 million in investments. Unagi first started dabbling with the scooter subscription idea late last year, adding a button to its website that said “subscribe” even though the service wasn’t available. “It was a way to gauge consumer sentiment,” said Hyman, who quickly discovered that interest in subscriptions was 10 times greater than interest in buying its $1,000 scooter. That was last fall. During the pandemic, interest in buying scooters has also been strong. Hyman said his company is selling thousands of scooters each month, compared with hundreds each month prior to the pandemic. Subscriptions, he said, are only likely to cannibalize 20 percent of the company’s outright sales “because it’s a different customer.” “For us,” Hyman said, “this is just opening up our existing business to other people who prefer access over ownership or who couldn’t afford $1,000 for a scooter.” ",https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/transportation/2020/08/05/unagi-launches-new-subscription-scooter-service-in-la
Sudden appearance of electric scooters irks Santa Monica officials,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,2,10,"Sudden appearance of electric scooters irks Santa Monica officials. Black, electric-powered scooters suddenly began appearing on the downtown streets, suburban sidewalks and beachside a few months ago in this urban coastal city. The dockless shared scooters took Santa Monica by surprise, including the mayor, who says he received a LinkedIn message from Bird chief executive Travis VanderZanden, offering to introduce him to the company’s “exciting new mobility strategy for Santa Monica” — after they landed in town. “If you’re talking about those scooters that are out there already, there are some legal issues we have to discuss,” Santa Monica Mayor Ted Winterer said he told VanderZanden. And to reinforce the point, the city filed a criminal complaint of nine counts centered on Bird’s failure to obtain a vendor permit, something the company maintains is applicable to food vendors, not dockless shared electric scooters. The criminal case by a cornerstone city of “Silicon Beach” against an electric scooter company illustrates the continuing challenges, years after the onset of now-massive shared economy companies such as Uber and Airbnb, that arise when integrating new technologies, even when those technologies help solve stubborn civic problems such as traffic congestion. At the root of the battle between Bird and the city of Santa Monica is an issue that has increasingly confronted municipal governments facing new tech and business models — a lack of directly applicable existing regulation and precedents. “These scooters literally just began showing up on our streets last fall,” said Anuj Gupta, Santa Monica’s deputy city manager and director of policy. “The challenge is that they decided to launch first and figure it out later.” A Bird representative says the company did reach out to the city before putting its scooters on the streets, but the company notes that Santa Monica has at least five city departments that could be involved in regulating its business. Expected or not, the scooters have been a hit. More than 40,000 people have taken a ride since the company began operating in September. Users download an app and pay $1 plus 15 cents a minute to ride them. In addition to the permit dispute, the city has raised concerns about safety. California law requires riders of motorized scooters to be at least 16 years old, to be licensed drivers, to wear helmets and to not ride on sidewalks. The Santa Monica Police Department has made 281 traffic stops and issued 97 citations involving Bird scooters between Jan. 1 and Tuesday, and the Santa Monica Fire Department has responded to eight such accidents. Minors and adults have been injured, including with a head trauma incident and an arm fracture, authorities say. Bird has taken a number of steps to encourage and educate its riders to follow the law, including a free helmet program and stickers on the floorboards of the scooters that list safety regulations. During the first weekend of a helmet giveaway in January, 1,800 riders requested a helmet, according to the company. A company spokesman said Bird plans to begin running advertisements that feature safety information. The company also shuts down its network at 8 p.m., picks up the scooters and takes them to a nearby facility, where they are recharged. “The fact that they launched first and now are doing this process makes it more difficult to change the behavior of folks,” Gupta said. “People have been riders on these scooters for months without helmets, with young people on them, so there’s a sense of this is how they’re meant to be ridden.” The challenges cities experience when integrating and regulating new technologies probably will continue to increase in complexity, experts say. Airbnb’s head of global policy and public affairs, Chris Lehane, said this is just the beginning. “Compared to the issues that are coming behind us, this is like a lemonade stand,” said Lehane, whose company connects renters with available private properties. “If you have a difficult time figuring out how to deal with scooters, what are you going to do when cryptocurrency is around the corner?” Gupta said that the existing regulatory framework wasn’t built for the new scooters but also that the city understands that there will be similar issues in the future. “We recognize that Bird is just the tip of the iceberg,” Gupta said. In many cities, officials are impeded not just by regulatory tools that might not yet exist, but also by siloed departments. “We had regulations and operational activities that didn’t look at a system,” said Stephen Goldsmith, a Harvard University professor and former deputy mayor of New York, talking about his efforts to integrate ride-hailing companies in New York. “No one was thinking about mobility; everybody was thinking about how you regulate a particular slice of it.” On Super Bowl Sunday in downtown Santa Monica, Bird scooters were very much a part of the landscape, propped up against fences and walls as well as on their own kickstands on the sidewalk. Passersby curiously eyed them, and some approached to learn more. “The scooters are something wonderful, and I’m really excited about it,” said Lorenzo Tejada, 28. “I don’t have to wait for a schedule or a bus; I can just hop on it, and let’s go.” On the Third Street Promenade, Tyler Catudioc, 20, a student at UCLA in nearby Westwood, was renting a scooter. “I thought it was kind of weird, but then I saw someone come and just take it, and I was really confused at why they could just go and take this and how it worked,” she said. “They’re all around Westwood, and you can just basically walk out of your apartment and ride one to class.” As the sun set over the iconic Santa Monica Ferris wheel, a couple of pedicab drivers tried to cajole tired beachgoers into rides while they waited near the scooters. “It’s just not safe; people are out here riding drunk, too,” said Keith Brown, adding that he doesn’t believe the scooters have affected his business. He said he witnessed an accident just the day before involving a minor on a scooter who was riding “recklessly” at “full speed.” Bird’s next test might be in San Diego, where the company has been running a pilot program since last month. “We are looking into this across departments, including city attorney, police department, mayor’s office, transportation, and the engineering and operations division,” said Anthony Santacroce, a city spokesman. He cited safety and right-of-way concerns as the city’s main issues. Despite the regulatory disagreements and safety issues, Santa Monica and Bird hope to arrive at a solution. A Bird representative characterized the legal dispute as a misunderstanding that can be worked out. The next court date in the case is scheduled for Feb. 26. “Nothing would make me happier than to have them out there operating legally and safely with the appropriate permits,” said Winterer, Santa Monica’s mayor. “It’s just a matter of talking; talk helps a lot.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/sudden-appearance-of-electric-scooters-irks-santa-monica-officials/2018/02/10/205f6950-0b4f-11e8-95a5-c396801049ef_story.html

(Update: On Feb. 14, Bird and Santa Monica resolved the lawsuit. The company agreed to secure proper licenses to operate there and to pay more than $300,000 in fines. ""Under the agreement, the city agreed to dismiss the nine original misdemeanor counts, and the company agreed to plead no contest to a single infraction of the city's municipal code,"" Bird spokesman Marcus Reese said in a statement. ""Bird now starts fresh with the city, and we look forward to continuing to provide a safe, environmentally-friendly transportation solution to the people of Santa Monica."") Stroll around Santa Monica these days and, along with its postcard-perfect Pacific Ocean views and lively pier, you’ll see hundreds of people on matte black electric scooters whizzing around this stylish Los Angeles suburb. They’ve been a hit since arriving unannounced last September from startup Bird, which just raised $15 million to take its “last-mile” service nationwide. The swift popularity of Bird, created by former Lyft and Uber executive Travis VanderZanden, also sparked a legal fight with Santa Monica, which filed a criminal complaint against it in December for operating without the right kind of business license. Undeterred, VanderZanden says talks with the city are “productive” and that his undocked, rechargeable scooter service is moving into more of Los Angeles as well as San Diego. “After I left the ridesharing space I really spent a lot of time thinking about the future of transportation and thinking about traffic problems … I started thinking that electric vehicles, short-range electric vehicles, that was the best way to try to get Americans out of cars,” he told Forbes. The Series A funding, led by Craft Ventures, “validates the model and what we're doing. We're excited to start scaling across the U.S.” Legal issues notwithstanding, Bird’s speedy success is a positive development for the Los Angeles region, the perennial leader in U.S. traffic congestion. It comes as major cities worldwide look for new tools, including bikeshare programs, carpooling apps, microtransit van services and powerful data platforms to curb traffic and climate-warming carbon emissions. Bird and its backers are convinced that its scooters do exactly that. “It’s convenient, it’s green, it alleviates traffic and makes cities more livable,” David Sacks, co-founder of Craft Ventures and a member of Bird’s board, said in a statement. “This product has the potential to transform urban areas.” The scooters go about 15 miles per charge and are designed to be used for relatively short trips. Riding one requires only the downloading of the Bird app, which directs you to an available scooter. Once located, the app is used to scan a Q-code on a Bird, and after driver’s license and credit card information are put in, it’s time to ride. There’s a base charge of $1 plus 15-cents per mile. To date more than 250,000 rides have been taken on Bird’s 1,000 scooters, though VanderZanden didn’t provide financial details about the business. He also declined to say who manufacturers them and where they’re made, though they bear a strong resemblance to Segway’s $399 ES1 electric scooter. When done riding, users are encouraged to park the Birds in accessible locations, but without blocking sidewalk access. Riders are also supposed to wear helmets and use the vehicles in bike lanes, rather than sidewalks, but it’s apparent that a large portion of Bird users in Santa Monica and next door Venice, California, disregard both guidelines. Bird uses a network of contractors to pick up and recharge the vehicles overnight, before putting them out again early the next day. ""That's something the cities love,"" VanderZanden said. That’s resulted in at least 281 traffic stops and 97 citations involving Bird scooters in the first five weeks of the year, The Washington Post reported. Local emergency services have also responded to eight Bird rider accidents, including a head trauma incident and an arm fracture, according to the report. In its Dec. 7, 2017, suit, Santa Monica said ""Bird employees, without required City authorization, flooded City public sidewalks with motorized scooters for rent on a daily basis. These scooters obstructed pedestrian access to public sidewalks, and blocked driveways and ADA Ramps. City staff repeatedly warned Bird against continuing their illegal business activities. The City also issued multiple citations directing Bird to obtain proper business licenses, to remove the scooters from the public sidewalks, and to cease storing scooters within the public right of way. However, Bird continued to disregard the City’s warnings and even citations."" Bird says Santa Monica’s suit arises from a ""misunderstanding"" about its business, and that it secured a license."" ""The issue is that the city also said that Bird needed a mobile vending license – like a taco truck would have. We didn’t think that this was necessary as we are not selling tacos or hot dogs,” the company said in a statement. “This type of misunderstanding happens as old regulatory schemes need to adapt to new technologies. We’re working closely with Santa Monica to resolve this misunderstanding."" VanderZanden, who left Uber in 2016, sees potential to resolve the spat. “We're having some great conversations with the city recently. The city wants Bird to operate in the city,” he said. “Santa Monica is a very eco-friendly city so I think sustainable transportation alternatives like Bird, the city ultimately loves. We've had some really productive conversations over the last month.” One of Bird’s Series A backers, Tusk Ventures, may help smooth things over with Santa Monica and other Bird markets, as well as providing funds. Led by Bradley Tusk, the firm touts itself as “the world’s first venture capital fund to work with and invest solely in high growth startups facing political and regulatory challenges.” Given his experience as Lyft’s COO and vice president of driver development at Uber, political and regulatory challenges are something VanderZanden has faced before.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2018/02/13/scooter-service-bird-raises-15-million-amid-legal-spat-with-santa-monica/
"Electric scooter startups, flush with cash, plan to expand to dozens of U.S. cities",Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,3,12,"Electric scooter startups, flush with cash, plan to expand to dozens of U.S. cities. Both LimeBike and Bird plan to bring the new urban mobility option to cities beyond California. Major U.S. cities need to prepare themselves for a new front in the startup scramble to change urban transportation: the rapid expansion of electric scooter systems. Like the rapid spread of dockless bikes in cities such as Dallas, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, electric scooters appear poised to hit the streets of metro areas across the country. Bird, a scooter startup based in Santa Monica, California, and led by a former Uber and Lyft executive, launched in September has quickly expanded across the westside of Los Angeles. Last Friday, the company announced a new $100 million funding round and plans to expand into 50 new cities by the end of the year. Limebike, the Bay Area dockless bike startup, recently launched its own electric scooter option, the Lime-S, and has incorporated hundreds of the small vehicles into their San Diego service. They also plan to expand to other cities. “If you’ve ever witnessed someone with a scooter in San Diego, it’s something that’s here to stay” says Zack Bartlett, LimeBike’s general manager in San Diego. “It’s something people want. There’s nothing like seeing someone get on a scooter for the first time.” But these app-driven transit options, which let users pick up and drop off scooters anywhere, seem poised to follow the path of ride-sharing and dockless bike firms, moving much faster than local governments and letting regulators and city officials play catch up. These vehicles seem likely to run into the same legal and logistics issues that have plagued the speedy roll-out of dockless bikes, including nuisance claims when bikes are dropped off and even discarded in inconvenient or out-of-the-way locations. Earlier this year Dallas officials, frustrated at the way dockless bikes had turned street corners into “bike-rental graveyards,” told the startups to clean up their acts, or the bikes would be removed. Bird has already run into issues with the Santa Monica government. In December, the city of filed a criminal case against the company, accusing it of operating without proper permits and owing more than $6,000 in fines. Last month, Bird agreed to pay more than $300,000 as part of a settlement with the city. Just last week, Santa Monica passed an emergency ordinance that would allow law enforcement officials to impound any Bird scooters or other “shared mobility devices” that pose an immediate hazard or obstruct access to public rights-of-way. “It is reasonable that the city would want to recoup its costs for impounding vehicles,” said Kenneth Baer, a Bird spokesman. “We are concerned that private contractors tasked with doing so may have a monetary incentive to indiscriminately impound Birds. We will be monitoring the situation closely and continue to work with the Council.” San Diego officials haven’t been as aggressive, according to a recent report about public safety concerns over the new scooters. The city’s Police Department told the Union-Tribune that it’s enforcing laws around the scooters, but wouldn’t provide stats on citations. Executive from both startups praise the electric vehicles’s low emissions and their role in a more multimodal transit system, promoting them as a great alternative for last-mile transit. An outgrowth of dockless cycling, which grew rapidly in China and has become a huge part of the country’s urban mobility system, these scooter systems, according to advocates, can encourage safer and more sustainable transportation patterns. “Our goal is to replace as many of those trips as possible so we can to get cars off the road and curb traffic and greenhouse gas emissions,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird, in a statement. “With this funding, we can move quickly to bring this vision to communities all across the country.” Both scooter systems claims safety first, with app-based warnings about wearing helmets, obeying traffic laws, and staying off sidewalks. California law requires helmets for riders of motorized scooters. But in Venice, where Bird scooters have become prevalent, casual observation suggests many riders aren’t wearing helmets when riding (the company has offered to send free helmets to users). According to Bartlett, the biggest battle for them is educating the public on how the system works, and getting everyone to follow safety rules (LimeBike has had similar issues, and launched Matrix-themed educational videos, to quell the problem in D.C). The company invests in proactive media pushed and user education, he says, and “the more people we can get them to follow the rules, the better it’ll be.”",https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/12/17110130/electric-scooters-dockless-urban-transit-mobility
"First the dockless bikes, now scooters.",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,3,13,"First the dockless bikes, now scooters. The electric scooter is the latest entrant into the app-based mobility market. Residents and visitors in the nation’s capital, and in many other U.S. cities, now have access to motorized scooters that rent for as little as $1 plus 15 cents per minute. The services work similarly to the dockless bike systems, allowing users to track down a scooter via an app and to drop it off just about anywhere after a trip is completed. No docking is required. The new transportation product is touted as another option for commuters to make first- and last-mile trips in complement to traditional transit. “Today, 40 percent of car trips are less than two miles long. Our goal is to replace as many of those trips as possible so we can get cars off the road and curb traffic and greenhouse gas emissions,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and chief executive of Bird, which recently announced plans to bring scooters to 50 U.S. markets by the end of the year. The company is in several California markets and has raised $100 million to expand to cities outside the state, including the District. Motorized scooters follow the entry of the dockless bike-share systems last year and continue the evolution of app-based shared services that began with Uber in the past decade. But the scooter systems have not been without controversy, having already raised concerns about people riding on sidewalks and without helmets. Electric scooters arrived in the District last month, when California-based Waybots launched. LimeBike, which started dockless bike operations in the city last fall, is adding scooters to its fleet this week. Scooter operations are being allowed in the city as part of the District’s exploration of new mobility services. In September, the city opened its doors to five dockless bike systems. The scooter services are expected to operate under the same terms and conditions as the dockless bike companies. Companies can rent up to 400 scooters each, but they must agree to share usage data with the city, the District Department of Transportation said. And just like with the dockless bikes, officials say, there are rules to using the free-standing scooters. A main complaint of the dockless bike programs has been bikes left parked in places where they are not allowed, such as monuments and where blocking private property and pedestrian access. Scooter users are urged to park in legal spots after completing a trip. If left on a sidewalk, for example, scooters shouldn’t block entrances and pedestrian pathways. The scooters are allowed in bike lanes but prohibited on sidewalks downtown, per city law. Users are not required to wear a helmet in the District, but scooter companies encourage users to take precautions and avoid using headphones or carrying anything in their hands during a ride. The Lime scooters go nearly 15 mph and have a 37-mile maximum range. The scooter operations underscore a continuing shift in the way Americans are making their trips and their willingness to try new, affordable ways to get around in major cites plagued by traffic congestion. Bird, which began operations in Santa Monica, Calif., in September, has recorded more than a half-million rides and continues to see ridership rise, the company said. In cities where residents are still coping with the arrival of thousands of rental free-standing bicycles, the scooter services add another layer of complexity to city grids — and one that is likely to ignite conflict among road users as concerns about safety rise and many cities struggle to come up with a regulatory framework for the services. In San Diego’s Pacific Beach, there have been reports of tension among users and the public, with elderly residents complaining about scooters left along driveways and sidewalks. In Santa Monica, police have been cracking down on riders illegally using them on busy sidewalks. LimeBike, which launched scooters in San Diego last month, is adding about 50 scooters to its D.C. fleet this week. Jason Starr, who oversees LimeBike in the District, said the San Diego operations have been strong in part because of the scooter fleet there; the company expects demand to rise in the District as people become familiar with the system. He said the bikes have been used 63,000 times since operations began in September. LimeBike users will be able to use the same app to spot, unlock and use a scooter. “With the launch of Lime-S, we are expanding the range of affordable, space-efficient and environmentally friendly mobility options available to D.C. residents of all eight wards,” Starr said. LimeBike also announced it has partnered with Georgetown University to launch a bike system on campus.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2018/03/13/first-the-dockless-bikes-now-you-can-hop-on-a-scooter-at-a-sidewalk-near-you/
Will dockless bikes and scooters take over city sidewalks?,Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,3,27,"Will dockless bikes and scooters take over city sidewalks? Scooter company Bird promotes a “Save our Sidewalks” pledge to reduce vehicle clutter. As dockless bikeshare and now electric scooter systems continue to expand in cities across the United States, many riders and local officials wonder whether our sidewalks can handle the influx of new vehicles. Dallas, which now has the nation’s largest dockless bikeshare fleet with more than 18,000 vehicles, has residents and city council members pushing back against the flood of bikes. In Seattle, the city government is testing designated dockless parking spots to try and avoid sidewalks cluttered with bikes. Bird, the Santa Monica, California-based electric scooter company rapidly expanding in west LA, believes transit companies should take the lead in solving the problem. This morning, the company’s CEO, Travis VanderZanden, introduced the Save Our Sidewalks (S.O.S.) Pledge, a plan he hopes other scooter- and bike-sharing companies adopt to avoid overcrowding and abandoned vehicles. His letter to competitors, such as LimeBike, Ofo, Mobike, and Jump, raised the specter of Chinese cities, where the explosion in dockless bikeshare led to “bike graveyards” of abandoned vehicles. The pledge features three main pillars. First, operators will pick up vehicles every night, to inspect and repair as well as reposition to avoid cluttering. Second, operators will follow a sustainable growth model, and only keep vehicles on the road if they are being used at least three times a day, weather permitting. Companies will also share utilization data with cities to verify these stats. Finally, companies will remit $1 per vehicle per day to city governments to build more bike lanes, promote safe riding, and maintain shared infrastructure. “We need to lead not just on technology, but on social responsibility,” VanderZanden wrote. “We hope that all of you join us in this S.O.S. Pledge to help our cities thrive.” Bird has had its own run-ins with city officials. In December, the city of Santa Monica filed a criminal case against the company, accusing it of operating without proper permits and owing more than $6,000 in fines, accrued in part from riders using city sidewalks. Bird later agreed to pay more than $300,000 as part of a settlement with the city. The S.O.S. plan, an effort to promote more transparency and corporate responsibility, comes at a time when transportation companies are under scrutiny for data-sharing, safety, and corporate responsibility. Ride-hailing apps are being asked about transportation data, Chicago is taxing Uber and Lyft rides to fund transportation upgrades, while other cities are trialing programs, such as designated drop-off spots, to help avoid congestion and help steer the development and adoption of new technologies. It also comes at a time of continued growth for dockless vehicles and bikeshare, which doesn’t show signs of slowing. Millions of dollars have been invested in various biking and mobility startups, and cities have responded with a spectrum of regulations, from outright bans to capping the number of dockless bikes allowed in certain markets. Limebike recently launched its own scooter system in San Diego, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., while Bird, which has provided more than half a million rides since launching in September, just announced it will be expanding into San Francisco, San Jose, California, and Washington, D.C.",https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/27/17168716/scooters-sidewalk-bikeshare-dockless-bikes-bird
Bird's Challenge To Rivals Shows The Micro-Mobility Wars Have Begun,Forbes,,National,2018,4,3,"Bird's Challenge To Rivals Shows The Micro-Mobility Wars Have Begun. The feel-good world of shared electric micro-mobility is apparently going to be as cutthroat as any other sector of the new transportation economy. Bird, a purveyor of shared electric scooters, released dozens of the two-wheeled, rentable devices on the sidewalks of San Jose and San Francisco on March 27, adding those cities to existing Bird locations in Washington D.C., San Diego and West Los Angeles. The Santa Monica-based startup has ambitions to grow its presence to as many as 50 cities and, thanks to a validated business model and $100 million in Series B funding, has the capital to do it. Bird’s SOS Pledge On the same day Bird deployed in the Bay Area, it issued an open letter to the CEOs of micro-mobility competitors Ofo, Limebike, Mobike and Jump, challenging them to join Bird’s Save Our Sidewalks (SOS) pledge. The three pillars of Bird’s pledge are as follows: All vehicles will be retrieved from city streets every night so as not to clutter neighborhoods. All vehicles will be used an average of three times per day, or they will be culled to avoid clutter. Bird will donate $1 per vehicle per day to each city to promote bike lane infrastructure and safe riding. “As an industry,” concluded CEO Travis VanderZanden, formerly of Uber and Lyft, “we need to lead … on social responsibility and cooperation with city governments.” Bird’s pledge of social responsibility and cooperation with city governments is both laudable and laughable because its deployment comes as a surprise to San Jose and stands in defiance of San Francisco’s request that it not deploy until a new city permitting process for shared scooters is complete. On March 29, San Francisco-based rival Spin released 20 shared electric dockless scooters of its own. Spin’s CEO, Euwyn Poon, addressed Bird’s SOS pledge with a post on Medium. “Our competitors’ recent overtures, including a recent 'Save our Sidewalks' campaign, come off as insincere given recent criminal complaints and settlements,"" he wrote, referring to Santa Monica’s criminal charges against Bird and Bird’s $300,000 payment to resolve them. “Unlike the other operators, we reached out to the appropriate stakeholders before operating in San Francisco.” Bird-shots fired. Bird's Pledge Is Impossible For Competitors To Match A healthy dose of skepticism should receive Bird’s substantive pledge points, as they could hardly be more self-serving. None of their competitors can possibly match them. First, Ofo, Mobike and Jump rent only bicycles, not scooters. Lime Bike primarily rents analog and electric-assisted bicycles, with some electric scooters deployed in San Francisco on the same day as Bird’s. Bicycle providers simply cannot round up hundreds of heavy bicycles every night in the same way Bird’s independent ‘Chargers’ can sweep up a dozen or more depleted scooters at a time for overnight charging. Nor should they; electric bicycle batteries can last a week or more without recharging. In other words, unlike Birds, shared bikes (electric or analog) do not need to come inside every night. With Pledge Point 1, Bird effectively embraces its need to be collected and charged nightly as a feature, while playing on legislators’ fears of what dockless bicycles might do at night, or what night owls might do to them. As for Point 2, a better metric than daily rentals might be miles traveled. While the average Bird trip is about one mile, the average Jump pedal-assisted bicycle trip was reportedly 2.7 miles. Analog shared bikes are averaging trip lengths somewhere in between. Again, Bird takes a mode limitation (shorter duration trips on scooters) and waives the increased number of trips as the sustainability metric of pride that bike share providers should strive to reach, when perhaps it should not be. Lastly, Bird’s $1 per vehicle per day pledge would undoubtedly be welcome by cities. That revenue could help offset the policing of stolen scooters, as well as provide resources for safety education and maintaining bike lanes for all users. Bird’s goodwill giveaway could be fueled by its $100 million cash infusion, or simply by a healthy profit margin. At $1 to rent, and $0.15 per minute, a one-hour Bird ride costs exactly $10, making them more expensive to rent than even a shared car on an hourly or daily basis. If Birds are used for only two hours per day, plus a dollar for each new rental — less the $5 paid to people who round up and charge Birds at night — Bird could easily net $15 per day per scooter before other expenses. A $1 nightly donation would constitute a 6.7% tip to San Francisco for the day’s use of streets and sidewalks. Compare Bird’s hourly rate with that of bicycle provider Ofo, which charges one-tenth of Bird’s fee ($1 per hour), or those of Limebike and Mobike, which charge one-fifth Bird’s fee ($1 per half-hour). These shared bicycles would have to be in use for eight to 15 hours per day to match Bird’s gross rental revenue. As a mandate, $1 per vehicle per day would be a threat to any micro-mobility provider trying to offer a low-cost option for consumers. It would also create an ethical dilemma for a city like San Francisco: Every dollar in the coffer helps, but equity and affordability are moral foundations of its transportation policy. Bird Backs New Legislation That Primarily Favors Bird Flush with cash and perhaps feeling cocky, Bird is now out to change California law to make it more favorable for its business. CEO VanderZanden told Inc. that ""Bird doesn't fit in one regulatory category, so we want to work with cities to figure it out and play nice.” But electric scooters actually do fit squarely into one regulatory category: They are motorized scooters under California state law. According to Vehicle Code section 407.5, a motorized scooter is: Any two-wheeled device that has handlebars, has a floorboard that is designed to be stood upon when riding, and is powered by an electric motor. This device may also have a driver seat that does not interfere with the ability of the rider to stand and ride and may also be designed to be powered by human propulsion. Unfortunately for Bird and for all other electric scooter providers in California, riders of motorized scooters must be 16 years old, have drivers’ licenses and wear helmets at all times — three significant barriers to convenience and accessibility when compared with shared bikes and electric bicycles, which (with one small exception) require none of the above. Bird doesn’t like it, nor should it. Its electric scooters go no faster than bikes, and a lack of pedaling is not a material safety difference that mandates minimum ages, licenses and helmets — especially when not all e-bikes need to be pedaled for propulsion. To remove one or more of these unnecessary barriers for Bird, Republican Assemblymen Heath Flora and Philip Chen are co-sponsoring Assembly Bill (AB) 2989, which would create a brand new category of vehicle in California: the “electrically motorized stand-up scooter,” which would be treated more like a Class 2 (throttle-powered) electric bicycle. The current draft of AB 2989 exempts stand-up electric scooters like Bird’s only from the drivers' license requirement, but additional changes (the age and helmet requirements, perhaps?) are expected before the finalization. The current draft notably leaves out three- or four-wheeled scooters and any reference to seats, which would prevent providers of seated electric scooters from benefiting from the relaxed regulatory requirements, too. In other words, the new accessibility would extend only to the able-bodied balancers. Those who might prefer to sit, like veteran amputees or the elderly, would still need drivers’ licenses and helmets to ride electric scooters with more than two wheels or a seat. How Mad Should People Really Be At Bird? Not Very Bird is merely following the tried and true Silicon Valley tech playbook: When regulations are ambiguous, deploy anyway. Ask forgiveness, never permission. Exploit legal loopholes where they exist, and lobby for change — and preemption — one level above where your regulatory problems arise. Boorish business behavior is one thing when societal externalities include increased automobile congestion, vehicle miles traveled and emissions. But what about when the externalities include fewer miles traveled, safer streets, cleaner air, reduced congestion, quieter neighborhoods, less car ownership, and more people with a stake in separated bike lanes? Scooters and e-bikes are only the first modes out of the gate. We are on the cusp of a Cambrian explosion in micro-mobility design that will blur all differences between bikes and scooters, Segways and skateboards, velomobiles and One-Wheels. The number of wheels, seats, floorboards and pedals are no longer meaningful distinctions for bike lane access — just small size and slow maximum speed. That is why instead of AB 2989 the California legislature and others should define a new catch-all category for any personal electric transport (PETs), with the following parameters: Battery-powered electric motor(s) Small physical dimensions (maximum width of 48 inches) Slow speed: 20 mph maximum — which cities are free to limit at will, and enforce stringently Any number of wheels Any number of seats Pedals or no pedals Handlebars or no handlebars No helmets required (above 16 years of age) No licenses required Access to any bike lanes or paths, and full use of the street — just like bikes. Two additional changes in law will increase safety and transform the way we move and live in cities: reduce motor vehicle speed limits in dense urban areas to 20 mph, and set aside one on-street parking space per block to be a PET parklet, adding more as demand rises. States and cities that work together to clear away the arbitrary distinctions between bikes and scooters of all types will bring huge savings to citizens, reduced congestion, more livable streets and increased mobility for all. States should not promote legislation that primarily benefits only the first and best-funded PET (Bird), to the detriment of all others to come. Bird’s hubris should be filed under free-market competition and a selfish kind of tactical urbanism, but not real harm. Let’s not feed the Birds, but let’s not clip their wings either.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimmcpherson/2018/04/03/the-micro-mobility-wars-have-begun/
My day riding 'Bird' e-scooters shows how the tech industry has changed my hometown,Mashable,,National,2018,4,7,"My day riding 'Bird' e-scooters shows how the tech industry has changed my hometown. When I was a teenager growing up in West LA, a friend of mine from a different part of the city derisively called my neighborhood ""Scooter-Ville"" because it was so ""wholesome."" He'd look out of my big bedroom window to see the neighborhood kids riding their Razor scooters up my empty block, around the cul-de-sacs, over and down the circular driveways. Now, a different sort of scooter has come to town: ""Bird"" electric scooters. Bird is a new transportation company that places un-docked electric scooters around a city. Users can unlock them with the touch of an app and use them to travel short distances at 15 mph. It's one of a host of new dockless transportation companies — along with LimeBike, Jump, and others — bringing easy-to-use, non-car transit options to cities across the country. It's also one of the more recent technology companies to call Santa Monica its home base and effectively its beta testing ground. I really tried to hate Bird scooters. The hubris with which Bird haphazardly introduced a decidedly uncool app-based product all around my hometown — without asking for permission from the city or input from residents — seemed to represent everything I resented about the tech industry's invasion of the place I grew up. Then I spent an afternoon trying out Bird — Birding, if you will — with one of my best friends, someone who grew up around the corner from me. We couldn't deny the Bird truth: These dockless scooters were convenient, useful, and really freaking fun. The flock descends Bird scooters started appearing in West Los Angeles on September 1. Since then, according to Bird, they've placed more than 1,000 e-scooters in the markets in which they operate, and there have been more than half a million rides taken since Bird's launch. Bird has lately expanded from just Santa Monica and Venice to West LA neighborhoods Brentwood and Westwood, which includes the UCLA campus. Bird also recently landed in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco — which many Bay Area residents are not too pleased about. To ride a Bird, users download an app and pay $1 per ride, plus 15 cents for each minute of riding time. But when it comes to transportation, an easy how-to is just the beginning of what a company needs to get up and running. Birds got off to a rocky start last fall, and they're still working out the kinks. The company began its service without applying for the proper permits, and without entering into any agreement with West LA cities. According to the Washington Post, Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden sent Santa Monica Mayor Ted Winterer a LinkedIn message by way of a heads-up. In response, Winterer gloriously said: “If you’re talking about those scooters that are out there already, there are some legal issues we have to discuss."" VanderZanden clearly learned some lessons from his days in ride-sharing. He's the first COO of Lyft and was VP of driver growth for Uber. The revolutionary apps famously instituted an ""ask for forgiveness, not permission"" strategy when they launched earlier in the decade. Bird has agreed to pay a $300,000 settlement for launching and operating without proper permitting, though it contends that the city was simply not equipped to permit a company such as Bird. It has also seriously upped its safety game, with multiple reminders to users to wear helmets and not ride on sidewalks. And in late March, Bird introduced the ""Save Our Sidewalks"" pledge and challenged other dockless ride-sharing companies to commit to avoiding the ""bike litter"" mess that these sorts of companies have created in China. Still, early in March, the City of Santa Monica announced that it would impound Birds found lying in the middle of the sidewalk — like the first IRL Bird that I encountered, which was plopped as a discarded road hazard outside of the pilates studio where I was taking a much-needed ""Buns and Guns"" class with my mother while visiting home. Gone birding My friend Amelia and I grew up around the corner from each other in ""Scooter-Ville,"" an atypically understated neighborhood that borders Santa Monica, Brentwood, and the Pacific Palisades. Amelia, who is an engineer for a tech company, and I were both visiting home at the same time, and we decided to run some errands and go Birding. After grabbing kale salads in the Montana shopping district, we decided to move to the Third Street Promenade. We opened the app and were surprised to find a dozen Birds within walking distance — and two on our very block! We left the restaurant, and I turned the corner to find my Bird — and nearly ran into it. It was propped up on its kickstand in the middle of the sidewalk. I claimed the Bird as my own, while Amelia went to find hers down the block. I opened my app, following the step-by-step instructions to unlock my Bird, which included safety warnings and waiver signings. I struggled a bit with the required Driver's License ID scanning, which did not work seamlessly. Luckily, two children and someone I assumed to be their manny came up to me and said, ""Oh, you're using Bird! We just used this one! Here's how you do it."" You have to be over the age of 18 to rent a Bird. And only one person may ride a Bird at a time. Hmmm... The kids cheered me on as I pumped, glided, and hit the throttle for the first time. The pickup was immediate. I definitely shrieked, and took it slow while I crossed the trafficky street. But as I hunted down Amelia (who had to pursue a second Bird, since the first one was nowhere to be found), I let it rip. It was ... fun! 15 miles per hour sounds slow, but for a girl who never got the hang of longboarding despite many teaching attempts by skater boyfriends over the years, I felt balanced, safe, and in command of my Bird. We set off down Montana Avenue toward the ocean, riding in the bike lane beside the BMWs. We agreed that having the break on the left and the throttle on the right was a bit confusing in action, somehow. And it was annoying that you had to keep your thumb on the gas the whole time to keep moving. But the process was pretty seamless, and we gained confidence and speed as we descended deeper into Santa Monica. As we rode down the wide stretch of 4th Street south to the Promenade, two skateboarders smirked as we passed, and I felt a brief moment of shame. But mostly, I was impressed by how fast we were getting where we were going. What would have been a 20-minute walk was a 5-minute Bird. What would have been a maybe 3- or 4-minute drive, plus endless circling in the crowded parking garages of Santa Monica, would conclude without the hassle of parking drama. We couldn't deny it by the end of the ride: Birding was great. We quickly found a bike rack on the corner of 4th Street and Wilshire, parking our Birds with their kickstands as we made our way to our afternoon of shopping on the Promenade. While walking among the Banana Republics and J. Crews, we saw multiple Birders. Bird's rules specifically prohibit riding in this pedestrian shopping zone, and we raised our eyebrows at the man in the sailor hat riding in full view of the rent-a-cops, and the kids pushing a locked Bird as it beep-beep-beeped feebly. With shoes and a new dress in hand, we decided to call an Uber home, because we had too much to carry, and it was getting late — Bird collects all of its e-scooters at the end of the day, and you can't activate them after 8 p.m. But as we waited for our Uber, watching him circle the congested one-way streets, a Bird stood proudly plopped on the corner where we were waiting. If we'd wanted to ride it, it was right there. Get off my lawn Much to my surprise, I became a Bird believer. But their presence, at least in theory, still irks me. I project onto them what I resent most about the technology industry's adoption of West LA, the place I grew up, as its Southern California home base. The characteristics I associate with West LA are peacefulness, beauty, and effortless cool. Bird is decidedly none of those things. Let's just say it: Bird scooters are an eyesore. They hang out where they don't belong, and their matte black design is dark and blah. Take a look at the shared bikes for rent around LA: baby blue, cream, green and white. Their cruiser curves and fun colors fit in with the trees and the sunlight. It's clear that whoever decided on the Bird aesthetics wasn't thinking about the particular look and feel of West Los Angeles — a place where even landscaping requires permits. Birds' aesthetics represent a lack of understanding about the value of a beautiful place to live, a lack of consideration that mirrors the attitude Bird took when it brought the service to Santa Monica without getting permission from city officials or residents. Bird scooters also cast something that's part of West LA lifestyle as a problem that needs ""disrupting."" Bird definitely has its uses, but walking and wandering from a yoga studio to a cafe is one of the joys of Santa Monica life. You stop at the grocery store, maybe run into a neighbor — it's the feel of small-town errands nestled in a big city. On the Promenade, doing our errands by foot, I actually ran into one of my best friends who was doing shopping for her sister's birthday. We hugged and laughed, and it occurred to me that if I had been zipping by on a Bird, I would have missed her. When the best way to get somewhere is by foot it encourages peace of mind. The introduction of a technological option robs the errand runner of that feeling. Finally, let's look at what Birds supplement: the cultural hallmark of West LA, the skateboard. There's no better metaphor for Silicon Valley's invasion of Santa Monica and Venice than the introduction of depersonalized electric scooters in the birthplace of skating. Skateboards represent a casualness and swagger that hangs in the clean, ocean-y air throughout West LA, whether you ride a skateboard or not. They're also an expression of individuality and style: Do you ride a longboard or skateboard? Is it covered in stickers or pristine as the day you bought it? But Birds, placed haphazardly around the city, not owned or adorned with or by anyone, lack the personality that walking, biking on a cruiser, skating, even roller blading on the bike path, provide. As an artifact and a symbol, Birds crystallize what irks some longtime residents (including me) about the recasting of placid West LA as Silicon Beach. But in practice, they're useful and fun, and I'm happy they're here. In our evening Uber ride back to my parent's house, we drove along Ocean Avenue, looked at the picnic lights and neon signs, and listened to the bumping bass emitting from hip restaurants and hotels along the Avenue. In West LA, the thatched bungalows lining the Venice canals have turned into glass and steel boxes, my teenage stomping grounds have become well-lit esplanades for romper- or performance fleece-wearing young professionals. The tech industry is partially responsible for making a yuppie paradise out of the character-filled place where I grew up, probably forever. But with the old is something new, something fun, and something that's definitely ready to be explored. That's something I can't stay mad at. Bird on.

An ex-Uber employee is littering the streets of San Francisco with scooters and claims the city wants to shut down his $300 million startup,Business Insider,,National,2018,4,13,"An ex-Uber employee is littering the streets of San Francisco with scooters and claims the city wants to shut down his $300 million startup. An electric-scooter startup sent a press release to reporters accusing San Francisco of planning to ban such scooters. A city official denied the charge, saying San Francisco was only considering regulating them. The city has received numerous complaints about the electric scooters since three venture-backed companies launched services there recently — and their devices started being strewn about on sidewalks. San Francisco may have a reputation for being an overregulated city. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's planning to ban electric scooters, despite a startup's warning cry that such a prohibition is imminent. The on-demand electric-scooter startup Bird on Thursday accused the city of San Francisco of trying to shut it down. In a ""breaking"" press release sent to the San Francisco Chronicle and SF Curbed, the company said the San Francisco Board of Supervisors was about to institute an emergency ban on scooters in the city. But Supervisor Aaron Peskin denied the claim, telling the Chronicle that Bird was spreading misinformation. Peskin said he planned to introduce legislation that would regulate scooters, not ban them. ""Contrary to Bird's assertions, regulations are not bans,"" Peskin said in a statement to Business Insider. A spokesman for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, which is working with Peskin on the bill and would oversee the permitting process for scooters under it, also said the agency never had plans for a scooter ban. A Bird spokesman, Ken Baer, declined to name the source of the company's belief that a ban was imminent, saying only that the company was responding to ""pretty good information, enough that we felt it was important for us to go out."" ""We hope they're wrong, or maybe they changed their minds once we went public,"" Baer said. ""It actually doesn't matter, as long as we get to the right outcome, which is to not rush into doing anything hasty and banning this transportation option for the city."" At least one of Bird's rivals was less alarmed, though. Euwyn Poon, a cofounder of Spin, a rival electric-scooter-sharing startup, told Business Insider his company hadn't heard anything from the city about banning electric scooters anytime soon. 'Numerous' complaints San Francisco's sidewalks have become cluttered with electric scooters in recent weeks as three startups with venture-capital funding — LimeBike, Spin, and Bird — have launched on-demand services in the city. The companies' services all work similarly: Customers use an app to find a nearby scooter they can borrow. They then just leave them on the sidewalk when they're done with them, though Bird's app recommends parking its scooters at bike racks whenever possible and not blocking entrances. Unlike some bike-sharing companies, Bird and the other scooter companies aren't providing docks for customers to park the scooters in, signaling to some customers that they can be left behind just about anywhere. That has led to ""numerous"" complaints, John Cote, a spokesman for the city attorney's office, told Business Insider in a statement. Residents have complained of the scooters routinely blocking sidewalks and building entrances, causing people to trip, and making sidewalks less accessible for people who use wheelchairs. Residents have also reported encountering people riding the scooters, which can reach speeds of up to 15 mph, on sidewalks, which is illegal. San Francisco's city attorney, Dennis Herrera, told Business Insider his office was considering legal action against the scooter companies. ""The bottom line is our sidewalks need to be safe for pedestrians,"" Herrera said in a statement. ""They are not dumping grounds for commercial scooters. Kids, parents with strollers, seniors, or people in wheelchairs shouldn't be tripping over scooters or forced into traffic to get around them."" But such complaints need to be weighed against what Baer, the Bird spokesman, described as the many benefits scooters provide. The devices are environmentally friendly and can help reduce traffic congestion from cars, he said. Bird would like to work with the city on possible regulations, Baer said. San Francisco isn't the first city to battle with Bird Bird has raised $115 million to date, including a $100 million round led by Valor Equity Partners and Index Ventures that it announced last month. Its rumored valuation is up to $300 million. The company's ranks include numerous employees who got their start at the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft. Among them is its founder and CEO, Travis VanderZanden, who was Lyft's first chief operating officer before becoming vice president of driver growth at Uber. Bird's conflict with San Francisco isn't its first with a city government. It developed a contentious relationship with the beachfront city of Santa Monica, California, soon after launching its service there in September as its first market. Bird started operating in the city without notifying city officials, The Washington Post reported. A criminal complaint has been filed against the startup for failing to obtain a permit to operate. In response to characterizations that Bird is acting like Uber, which has been infamous for flouting local ordinances, Baer said that while Uber was ""clearly in violation"" of local laws, Bird wasn't. San Francisco, for example, did not previously have a law governing electric-scooter services, he said. ""For this, I don't see what the argument is for being illegal,"" Baer said. ""No one is pointing to a law on the books saying 'it's illegal.'""",https://www.businessinsider.com/scooter-startup-bird-claims-san-francisco-wants-to-shut-it-down-2018-4
Electric scooters might revolutionize urban transport — if it wasn’t for stupid humans,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,4,19,"Electric scooters might revolutionize urban transport — if it wasn’t for stupid humans. You’ll find them obstructing sidewalks in Austin, draped on trash cans in San Francisco and tipped over like dominoes in Los Angeles. In Washington, workers dredged two of them from where Rock Creek flows into the Potomac River. They’re Internet-connected scooters, and a bunch of well-funded tech start-ups think they might just upend how we get around cities. First, they have to survive a speed bump: jerks. Companies including Bird Rides, LimeBike, Spin and Waybots this spring flooded a half-dozen cities with the motorized two-wheelers. Then came a wave of scooters behaving badly. And in some cities, the era of start-ups disrupting first and seeking forgiveness later seems to have worn out its welcome. “I’m going to go back and live in the 1850s, and I’m going to hitch up my horse somewhere and see how the scooters like that,” said Sherrie Matza during a hearing about the scooter scourge at San Francisco’s City Hall on Monday. We've been riding motorized scooters around San Francisco to get a handle on all the fuss. What makes these upright rides different from children’s toys is their motors. They zip as fast as 15 mph, which can make getting around five times faster than walking — but also a hair-raising test of balance. You do, undoubtedly, look goofy riding one. These scooters also have GPS and data connections. Using a smartphone app, you can locate one nearby and unlock it for as little as $1. But it’s up to you to ride responsibly and park out of the way. Evidence suggests that many people don’t. “It now feels strange when I'm not tripping over one or almost getting clipped by someone zooming by each day,” said Alex Kummert, who commutes on foot into San Francisco’s Financial District. Call it the eternal optimism — or is it willful ignorance? — of tech start-ups. Dockless scooters follow a wave of shared transport technologies that started with Uber cars, then expanded to shared commuter vans and more recently added “leave them anywhere” shared bikes such as Ofo and Jump. Yet even in the months after hard-charging Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick got ousted, the scooter start-ups are being caught not thinking through the consequences of their technology — and drawing from Uber’s old playbook of charging into cities and skipping city hall. Austin has impounded more than 50 scooters. San Francisco seized 66, and on Monday its city attorney sent three companies a cease-and-desist letter calling their services a “public nuisance” and saying they were “endangering public health and safety.” Cities are struggling to figure out how to manage transport options that aren’t built around personal cars. Where, exactly, are scooters supposed to be stored — should you have to pay for parking? Scooters left haphazardly on sidewalks and in front of doors are a serious impediment for wheelchairs and the elderly. (PSA: To not be a jerk, the correct way to park is at a bike stand or against a wall, away from pedestrians and entryways.) And what happens when streets are filled with hot-rodders whizzing by and scaring the bejesus out of people? Scooters can also be a danger to riders: Many people ride them on sidewalks and without helmets, flouting the law. Officials in Santa Monica, Calif., have made hundreds of traffic stops because of the electric scooters and say children and adults have suffered head trauma. (PSA, Part 2: Invest in a helmet and ride scooters on streets or bike paths — never on steep slopes and never on sidewalks.) Some of the scooter start-ups haven’t exactly been asking for permission. Bird, which has raised $115 million from venture capitalists, was founded by former Uber executive Travis VanderZanden. After Bird launched in Santa Monica last fall, the company paid $300,000 to settle a complaint from the city for not having a proper license. San Francisco and Austin are now weighing regulations, and in Washington the scooters are covered under an existing dockless pilot program. Tensions are particularly high in San Francisco, a dense city that was also the first to encounter Uber. Scooters dominated a meeting Monday in City Hall as lawmakers, citing hundreds of citizen complaints, weighed how to regulate them. “It is clear that many of these companies continue to build their corporate empires off a basic premise: making massive profit always trumps protecting the public, and innovation is only possible by cutting corners,” said Aaron Peskin, a city supervisor. “It would be very nice if the tech bros could come in and ask for permission instead of asking for forgiveness,” he said. Among those in the long line for citizen comment were disability- and pedestrian-rights activists, along with scooter fans in hoodies. “I think the scooters run amok are actually a plot of the young people to kill off all us old farts so they can have our rent-controlled apartments,” said Fran Taylor, a San Francisco resident who attended the hearing. Others praised how shared scooters let them decrease the cost of getting around. “Sometimes I need to get from place to place downtown, five six blocks at a time, and the convenience of the Bird has been very helpful for me,” said Jack Strong, a contractor. The scooter companies say their interests are aligned with cities that want to cut down on congestion and the environmental impact of cars. “Rides are going to have to shift to some new technologies, and we think we’ve found something that can really help,” said Carl Hansen, Bird’s director of government affairs. “Bikes fall over. Any transportation technology is going to have its issues.” The human element may be the key to winning over regulators, but it is a hard issue to crack. Why do people flout rider rules, not to mention torture the scooters? “These are edge cases,” Spin's president, Euwyn Poon, said of inconsiderate scooter parkers. After a while, he said, the issues will diminish — thanks to a combination of efforts to weed out rude riders and the fact that people get used to new vehicles over time. “They become part of the city and part of the street,” he said. Many of the scooters’ companion apps warn that you are not supposed to ride on sidewalks, remind you to wear a helmet and even ask you to scan your driver's license. Bird and LimeBike said they would start requiring riders to submit a photo of where they park. In China, where dockless bikes are ridden by millions, the idea of shared transportation tech has been a hit but has also taken its toll. Some cities in that country have far more bikes than demand dictates, leaving sidewalks that have no place to walk or with piles of mangled bikes. Ofo, China’s largest dockless bike provider, says the solution is education. “People are going to park them incorrectly in the early days,” says Chris Taylor, Ofo’s head in North America, where the company launched operations last year. But over time, he said, people learn what the “furniture zone” is on sidewalks. “People just need to be responsible and know the limits,” said Patrick Tao, 37, after taking his first ride on a Bird in San Francisco on Tuesday. He parked his scooter, which had a flat tire, next to a bike rack. He thinks the tech could have a future but acknowledges that “there is always going to be some a--hole who ruins it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/19/electric-scooters-might-revolutionize-urban-transport-if-it-wasnt-for-stupid-humans/
Electric Scooters Are Causing Havoc. This Man Is Shrugging It Off.,New York Times,,National,2018,4,20,"Electric Scooters Are Causing Havoc. This Man Is Shrugging It Off. Travis VanderZanden, the chief executive of electric scooter company Bird Rides, surveyed the new indoor park at his office one morning this week. While the space is still under construction, it will eventually have a winding path and a park scene, with benches and trees, he said. It will be made to take his little Bird scooters on scenic trips inside the confines of the 20,000-square-foot office situated near the Pacific Ocean and, more important to him, on Electric Avenue here in Venice, Calif. “When you ride a Bird, it reminds you of being free,” said the 39-year-old. “It gives you freedom. Like you have wings.” Mr. VanderZanden did not act like a man in the middle of a controversy. But he is here to disrupt — by any means necessary. Electric scooters have arrived en masse in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, with companies competing to offer the dockless and rechargeable vehicles. Leading the pack is Mr. VanderZanden’s Bird, with rivals including Spin and LimeBike. The start-ups are buoyed with more than $250 million in venture capital and a firm belief that electric scooters are the future of transportation, at least for a few speedy blocks. The premise of the start-ups is simple: People can rent the electric scooters for about a $1, plus 10 cents to 15 cents a minute to use, for so-called last-mile transportation. To recharge the scooters, the companies have “chargers,” or people who roam the streets looking to plug in the scooters at night, for which they get paid $5 to $20 per scooter. The problem is that cities have been shocked to discover that thousands of electric scooters have been dropped onto their sidewalks seemingly overnight. Often, the companies ignored all the usual avenues of getting city approval to set up shop. And since the scooters are dockless, riders can just grab one, go a few blocks and leave it wherever they want, causing a commotion on sidewalks and scenes of scooters strewn across wheelchair ramps and in doorways. So officials in cities like San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., have been sending cease-and-desist notices and holding emergency meetings. Some even filed charges against the scooter companies. “They just appeared,” said Mohammed Nuru, director of the San Francisco Public Works, which has been confiscating the scooters. “I don’t know who comes up with these ideas or where these people come from.” Dennis Herrera, the San Francisco city attorney who sent cease-and-desist letters to Bird and others, described the chaos as “a free for all.” Mr. VanderZanden said given how enormous a social shift he believes his scooters are, he was not surprised it ruffled some feathers. But people would eventually adjust, he said. “Go back to the early 1900s, and people would have a similar reaction to cars because they were used to horses,” he said. “They had to figure out where to park all the dockless cars.” If there is something familiar about these scooter companies’ strategy of just showing up in cities without permission, that’s because that has now become a tried-and-true playbook for many start-ups. In its early days, Uber, the ride-hailing giant, also barreled into towns overnight to launch its service and only asked for forgiveness later. “Cities don’t know what it is,” Caen Contee, the head of marketing for LimeBike, said of the arrival of electric scooters. “They don’t know how to permit it until they’ve seen it.” That has led to scenes like a crowded and contentious transportation committee meeting at San Francisco City Hall on Monday, where so many people wanted to speak about the scooters that everyone was limited to one minute each. David Valladares, who works as a “charger” for Bird, said the work helped “supplement my income due to the large cost of living in the Bay Area.” He urged the city to concentrate on deadly cars instead, noting, “I’ve never seen a scooter-on-scooter accident kill somebody.” Advocates for the disabled said they would have trouble moving through the streets if the scooters were zooming around or left on sidewalks. Advocates for older people said rampaging scooters would also encourage them to seek the safety of their homes, becoming shut-ins. “Somebody whizzing along at 15 miles an hour, that’s a symbol of entitlement and arrogance,” said Fran Taylor, a retired medical reporter. She called the scooters “a plot of the young people to kill off all us old farts so they can have our rent-controlled apartments.” Back in Venice, Mr. VanderZanden seated himself upstairs in a barren conference room with a view of the parking lot. He leaned back and kept his eyes on his open computer screen as he talked. He wore his blond hair slicked back. He said efforts to regulate his Bird scooters differently than personally owned scooters was discrimination against the poor. “Not everyone can afford their own electric scooter,” he said. “We shouldn’t discriminate against people that are renting versus owning.” Before launching Bird, Mr. VanderZanden had worked at tech companies and founded an on-demand carwash service called Cherry. Cherry was acquired by Lyft in 2013 and Mr. VanderZanden became chief operating officer at the ride-hailing company. He left Lyft in 2014 and joined Uber as vice president of growth that same year. Lyft sued him for breaching a confidentiality agreement and fiduciary duty. The litigation was eventually settled. Of his time at Uber, which has since been exposed as having had a growth-at-all-costs environment, Mr. VanderZanden said: “I learned some good things, and I learned some bad things.” He left Uber in 2016 and moved to Southern California. Last year, he founded Bird to bring electric scooters, already popular in cities across China, to America. To date, Bird has raised $115 million from investors, including Craft Ventures and Index Ventures. Mr. VanderZanden now has a team of more than 100 people. He likes wordplay. The scooters are called Birds. He calls a group of people riding on the scooters a flock. The areas where scooters are supposed to be generally kept are called nests. His mom’s name is Robin. “We might have taken the birds too far,” Mr. VanderZanden said. Bird initially rolled out its scooter-rental service in Santa Monica and now operates in seven cities. The company will not disclose how many scooters are in operation but said it has sent out 22,500 helmets to riders, as part of a compliance effort for cities that require riders to use helmets. Bird has also hit one million rides. Mr. VanderZanden said greater Los Angeles, including Santa Monica, has been especially excited about Bird and that the area has become a transportation tech hub. “The city’s been very receptive,” he said. It actually has not. In Santa Monica, the city attorney’s office filed a nine-count misdemeanor criminal complaint against Bird and Mr. VanderZanden last year for operating a commercial scooter rental business without a mobile vending business license and for failing to comply with citations. The company pleaded no contest and paid a settlement of $300,000. Those who work for Santa Monica’s city government even went so far as to reach out to other towns to caution them about electric scooters. “My brother and sister legislators from Santa Monica warned me that that phenomenon has hit their cities,” said Aaron Peskin, who is on San Francisco’s board of supervisors, the city’s legislative branch. Referring to the scooter start-ups, he added, “These people are out of their minds.” Even other scooter companies don’t seem to like each other much. When Mr. VanderZanden recently announced a pledge for scooter start-ups to sign that promised responsible growth and revenue sharing with cities, he did not get much of a response. “We’re still waiting for others to sign the pledge,” he said. Mr. VanderZanden also feigns ignorance about all the controversy he has caused. “Anything any city’s asked us to do, aside from shut down, we do,” he said. And even though Bird is handing out helmets, he said the requirement that scooter riders wear them is absurd unless all pedestrians have to wear helmets because cars are the real danger. “We’re not going to be happy till there are more Birds than cars,” Mr. VanderZanden said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/technology/electric-scooters-are-causing-havoc-this-man-is-shrugging-it-off.html
#ScootersBehavingBadly: U.S. Cities Race To Keep Up With Small Vehicle Shares,NPR,NPR,National,2018,4,23,"#ScootersBehavingBadly: U.S. Cities Race To Keep Up With Small Vehicle Shares. From San Francisco to Washington, D.C., e-scooters and dockless bikes have become the latest transportation trend to grip urban spaces — and local governments are struggling to keep up. The concept is simple: Riders download an app, find and unlock a scooter or bike, and leave it when they're done. Many cost as little as $1, and fans of the services tout them as faster, easier, and greener ways to get where they're going. But some residents are angry about what they call bad behavior: riders weaving in and out of traffic without helmets; speeding down sidewalks and blocking the way for pedestrians and those with disabilities; and discarding bikes and scooters in inconvenient places. It's even inspired a hashtag: #ScootersBehavingBadly. Cities have clashed with the rental companies on ways to approach regulation. San Francisco and Santa Monica both have issued cease-and-desist orders to a handful of firms until they can come up with solutions. In Austin, Texas, the company LimeBike deployed 200 scooters before it finished negotiating an agreement with the city. Patrick Sisson, a reporter with the website Curbed, says local governments largely have been unprepared to regulate the new transportation technologies, and are having to play catch-up on creating new rules. ""It sort of follows the same blueprint we saw with Uber and Lyft, where tech companies are looking to provide transportation mobility solutions,"" Sisson says. ""But they're asking for forgiveness after the fact instead of permission before the fact."" Interview Highlights On #ScootersBehavingBadly in California It's what some have called ""Scooter-geddon."" In San Francisco especially, people have been complaining quite a bit about these scooters — that they're blocking the right of way. San Francisco has issued a lot of declarations and passed laws that are looking for permitting of the scooters. They're actually even asking scooter riders to take photos of where they park their scooters to make sure the not blocking the right of way. In Santa Monica, the company Bird settled for $300,000 with the city after being fined for safety violations and blocking the right of way.... This is also spreading to cities like Washington, D.C., and Austin where people are having the same complaints. On how e-scooters and dockless bikes provide solutions to other transportation issues. The tech companies — they're on to something. I mean, there's a great desire for people to have car-free, last-mile transportation solutions [instead of walking from the train or bus]. I remember speaking to someone in Santa Monica city government that says, ""You know, we really like the idea of having these around — it's just there's existing transportation infrastructure, there's safety issues. We just gotta make sure it's properly regulated."" On cities' solutions to issues created by new forms of transportation Seattle's been trialing a dockless bike parking space that maybe is showing what could be done in scooters and other situations. You're also seeing in San Francisco that Lyft is trialing a dropoff and pickup system, where they would designate certain parts of a neighborhood for dropping off and picking up riders. There's a lot going on, and I think we're still sort of an early days in terms of how this regulation is going to work.",https://www.npr.org/2018/04/23/603140766/-scootersbehavingbadly-u-s-cities-race-to-keep-up-with-small-vehicle-shares
People are vandalizing the scooters taking over San Francisco with everything from stickers to poop,Business Insider,,National,2018,4,24,"People are vandalizing the scooters taking over San Francisco with everything from stickers to poop. San Francisco residents are vandalizing electric scooters and in one case, pooping on them. That's gross. The city has received numerous complaints about the scooters in recent weeks and has already begun impounding scooters parked illegally. Some activist residents of San Francisco are apparently so outraged by the sight of electric scooters on city streets that they've resorted to extreme measures, including literally pooping on them. Motherboard reported Tuesday that electric scooters around San Francisco have become targets of vandalization. Scooters have been seen with broken wiring, with stickers covering the QR codes that allow riders to unlock them, thrown into trashcans and, yes, even pooped on. Kenneth Baer, a Bird spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement that the company has had ""few"" problems with theft and vandalism. “... because all Birds are tracked via GPS, we are able to see where they are at all times. Any time an incident of abuse on our platform is reported, we investigate it thoroughly and are continually working to use technology to improve Bird,"" he said. The scatological scooter sabotage comes as three separate startups — Bird, LimeBikes, and Spin — all recently began placing the two-wheeled vehicles throughout the city. The services all work similarly and bill themselves as environmentally friendly transportation alternatives. Using a smartphone app, city residents can reserve a nearby scooter, ride around on it for a small fee, and, at the end of the journey, leave the scooter anywhere to be claimed by the next rider. Unlike many bike-sharing programs, the scooters don't need to be attached to a special dock, so riders can just hop off and walk away. San Francisco officials say they have received numerous complaints about the scooters, claiming the scooters routinely block sidewalks and building entrances, cause people to trip, and make sidewalks less accessible to children and people in wheelchairs. Residents have also reported seeing riders on sidewalks, which is illegal. In response to increased public pressure and complaints, the San Francisco City Attorney sent the scooter startups cease-and-desist letters last week, calling scooters public nuisances and a public safety hazard and has begun impounding scooters that are seen illegally parked. The city voted last week to require scooters companies to apply for a permit before operating in the city.",https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-electric-scooters-vandalized-pooped-on-2018-4
Adults Are Terrorizing San Francisco On Tiny Electric Scooters,Wall Street Journal,,National,2018,4,25,"Adults Are Terrorizing San Francisco On Tiny Electric Scooters. In a compact city known for experimentation, popular electric-powered devices are injuring toes, starting fights, prompting debates over regulation; ‘Wild West situation’. Ben Wolfson glanced up from his phone while walking in downtown San Francisco last week to see a woman whizzing toward him on what looked like a child’s kick scooter. Only this one had an electric motor. “She was just barreling down” on the sidewalk, he said. Mr. Wolfson, 28 years old, jumped out of the way and shot her a “dirty look,” but said she didn’t react. “She just had not a care in the world,” he said. While the rest of the country is pondering the future of tech giants’ pervasive influence in our lives, here in the tech capital, a fiery debate has exploded over the pervasive presence of electric scooters. Last month, a trio of well-funded startups began flooding the city with hundreds of electric for-rent scooters that can travel up to 15 miles an hour—starting at just $1 a ride. Riders pick them up and leave them most anywhere. The whimsical transit option has turned sidewalks into breeding grounds of conflict, pitting pedestrians against fans of cheap car-free transportation. In compact San Francisco, where a freewheeling culture often collides with anti-tech sentiment, scooters are joining an array of unconventional transportation from self-driving cars to electric unicycles. “All hell broke loose” after the scooters seemingly arrived overnight in San Francisco, said the city’s supervisor, Aaron Peskin , who is spearheading legislation to regulate scooter-sharing programs. It is, he said, “a Wild West situation.” One resident sent Mr. Peskin a photo of his bloodied toe—injured after tripping on a scooter tossed in front of his house. Hundreds of illegally parked scooters have been impounded, while others have ended up in trash cans and bodies of water. The sidewalk rage is likely a preview of things to come across the nation given that one of the startups, Bird Rides Inc., just raised $100 million to bring scooters to 50 cities this year. These aren’t mopeds. They are like children’s Razor scooters—with a platform attached to small wheels and a handlebar—but souped-up with electric motors. Because some riders say they feel more vulnerable on a small scooter than on a bicycle, and wear no helmet, they prefer to steer them on the sidewalks, even though riding them there is illegal. Even self-professed fans bristle at riders who lack proper decorum. Daniel Singer, 18, an occasional scooter rider, said he was walking on a sidewalk, when he got into a face-off with three oncoming riders on scooters. He stared them down and gestured to the street. One rider grimaced, then moved off the sidewalk. “It’s a nuisance for pedestrians,” he said. Scooters, located and paid for with apps on phones, cost 15 cents a minute. There aren’t any designated drop-off points; riders just leave them when they’re done. The scooters have GPS, so at night, someone drives around, picks them up and recharges them for the next day. Scooters sprawled in the middle of sidewalks have drawn ire among the aesthetically concerned. Stickers reading “HEY DUMB F—- GET OFF THE SIDEWALK” have appeared on some scooters, and city officials have impounded scores of illegally parked scooters blocking the use of sidewalks. Travis VanderZanden, chief executive of Bird Rides, said “we weren’t quite sure what to expect” in terms of a public reaction in San Francisco. Bird and the other scooter companies say they instruct riders to stay off the sidewalk, park at the edge of the sidewalk and wear helmets. Bird offers to ship riders a free helmet. The massive pileup of opinions spilled into City Hall last week, as angry residents faced off with scooter proponents during a lengthy hearing. Karen Fishkin, who sits on a local seniors’ organization, took to the lectern to plea for regulation. “We’ve been down here to discuss with you Segway, robots on the street, and now scooters,” she said. “Pedestrians are kind of feeling like we’re getting left out in the cold.” Happy riders seemed confused that people were so indignant about a small two-wheeled vehicle, noting they take cars off the road. Others said they see more trash on the city’s streets than scooters. Andrew Lee said he used to enjoy riding a mini-Segway, but found it difficult to lug around. The day after he tried a rental scooter, “I gave away my Segway,” he said. Now he rides scooters daily. Mr. Lee, 33, trekked to City Hall for the hearing, and zipped away on scooter. Even before scootermania, a stroll through downtown reveals a combination of autonomous cars, electric skateboards, electric unicycles, electric-assisted bikes, and of course, the famous cable cars. The occasional Segway makes an appearance, while the fad of a few years ago, hoverboards, has mostly crashed and burned. In the scooter skirmish, multiple sides are sparring. Pedestrian advocates are bickering with pro-transit residents. City officials, meanwhile, are upset the companies didn’t wait for them to write the rules. The transit fracas kicked off last fall when Mr. VanderZanden’s company sprinkled scooters around Santa Monica, Calif., informing the Santa Monica mayor through a LinkedIn message. After a spat with city officials—including a criminal complaint from the city that was later settled—scooter-share is now legal there, and popular. A steady flow of riders today zip up and down the beachside sidewalk. Mr. VanderZanden says Bird’s customers totaled 90,000 miles of scooter rides in the first three weeks in San Francisco. A walk around the city’s financial district reveals a constant stream of scooters. Riders weave in between pedestrians on sidewalks and stopped cars on streets during rush hour, and zip next to bikes in bike lanes—sometimes to the ire of bikers. Occasionally two riders are spotted crammed onto a small scooter. The city’s solution for taming the Wild West? A permit program, where the city would grant companies the ability to rent out scooters, so long as they follow rules. City officials say they hope to have rules crafted next month. For now, the fight goes on. The city has been scooping up parked scooters that block the sidewalk, which is illegal. The city impounded nearly 300 scooters last week, fining each company to pick them up, said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Public Works. “We just got mounting complaints,” she said.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/adults-are-terrorizing-san-francisco-on-tiny-electric-scooters-1524670611
Are ride-share electric scooters the future of urban transport?,The Guardian,,National,2018,4,25,"Are ride-share electric scooters the future of urban transport? Electric share scooters have taken over Santa Monica, an affluent beachside city on the edge of Los Angeles, but as they swiftly spread across other cities in California and the US a backlash is already gathering force. Download an app, scan a scooter’s barcode and away you go, zipping at up to 15mph to your destination. You leave the scooter on the pavement for the next rider. Bird, a startup run by former Uber executives, launched the scooters in Santa Monica last September. Hundreds were deposited around the city overnight, the devices so ubiquitous people literally tripped over them. They have thrilled, bemused and aggravated – feelings San Francisco, San Jose, Austin and Washington DC are now experiencing as scooters from Bird and two other startups, LimeBike and Spin, hit their streets, with dozens more cities due to receive them this year. A full-scale backlash is under way in San Francisco, where some scooters have been tossed into trash cans and lakes. The city attorney has threatened to impound scooters, calling them dangerous, unlawful and examples of tech arrogance. City hall is exploring ways to regulate the devices. With a global market in their sights, the scooter startups are pushing back Bird comes armed with $115m (£80.3m) in investment funding and seems to take the Uber-esque, hard-charging stance on regulation that it is better to seek forgiveness than permission. A tangle with Santa Monica officials earned a criminal complaint and hefty fine. “The demand is huge. We’re looking to reach more than 50 markets this year and eventually have Birds all over the world,” says Stephen Schnell, the company’s vice president of operations, noting that Britain is on the company’s radar. “We try to pick cities that have bicycle lane infrastructure.” Schnell, like Bird’s CEO Travis VanderZanden, previously worked at Lyft and Uber. Ride sharing companies are shaking up urban transport but many commuters still have the “last mile” problem: a distance too far to walk and too short to drive, says Schnell. “This is a way to get people out of their vehicles.” Marlon Boarnet, an urban planning and spatial analysis professor at the University of Southern California, says dockless scooters can facilitate short trips while being light on the environment and using minimal space. “Traditionally we view this as walking or bicycling, but the concept can and should be extended to light and small powered vehicles like electric scooters. One could also include in this set small neighborhood electric vehicles or electric motor assisted bicycles. We should expand our idea of what an acceptable ‘short trip’ vehicle is.” Boarnet hopes the companies and city authorities can resolve issues such as where the scooters are left. When clumped in the middle of a pavement scooters can seem more nuisance clutter than transport revolution. The boom and bust of dockless bicycles in several markets – exemplified by a picture of a bicycle graveyard in China – act as a cautionary tale. The Guardian scooted around Santa Monica for a week to try them out. The longest journey was from the city’s downtown to Bird’s headquarters in Venice, three miles away. It took 17 minutes and cost $3.55 – a $1 base fee plus 15 cents per minute. The experience was positive. Scooters were easy to find with the app’s map pinpointing devices left by trees, parking meters, benches and doorways. Once you’ve scanned and unlocked the barcode with your phone there’s a childlike glee in kicking off with your foot, pushing the handlebar’s throttle button and gliding down the street. Not encased in a shell of metal and glass, you feel connected to your surroundings – both hands are needed to steer so it is difficult to text or fiddle with your phone. Tootling down Main Street, the most striking impression was the response of pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders and motorists: in most cases there wasn’t one. In September the scooters were a novelty and drew stares. Now they’re part of the streetscape and barely remarked upon – except by some tourists who gawk and take pictures. Bird reports quick adoption; there are more than 50,000 regular riders in and around Santa Monica, and riders in San Francisco notched up more than 60,000 miles in just 17 days. “It’s kind of amazing,” says Schnell. What’s amazing, say critics, is the irresponsibility of the scooter companies and many of their riders. Few wear helmets in Santa Monica. It is common to see children riding scooters, two people on one scooter, parked scooters cluttering sidewalks and moving scooters scattering pedestrians on sidewalks. San Francisco residents have joined Santa Monicans in venting on social media. Riders are supposed to be licensed drivers, helmeted and are meant to ride on streets, preferably in bicycle lanes. Users need a driver’s licence to download the app and upon request Bird sends free helmets. Still, improper use abounds. According to a city spokesperson, so far Santa Monica has recorded 11 accidents, some serious, 328 citations and 694 traffic stops. Irked that Bird launched with little or no warning, city authorities filed a criminal complaint over lack of business licences and vendor permits. Both sides settled in February, with Bird promising to seek the licences and to pay more than $300,000 in fines. “Even though they got off to a rocky start we didn’t move to kick them out because based on our values we’re really committed to this new model of mobility,” says Anuj Gupta, Santa Monica’s deputy city manager. There has been no detectable impact on car congestion but scooters are now part of the transport mix, he says. “We honestly understand and share in the excitement about these devices.” But there’s another concern. If Bird and rival startups plant scooters on every block won’t people have even less incentive to walk and exercise? “You mean WALL-E world,” says Schnell, referencing the Pixar film in which future humans become obese gluttons ensconced in padded floating arm chairs. “Let’s hope not. With the scooters at least you have to stand.”",http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/apr/25/electric-scooters-urban-transport-bird-santa-monica-uk
What Drives Value At Electric Scooter Sharing Startups Like Bird?,Forbes,,National,2018,5,1,"What Drives Value At Electric Scooter Sharing Startups Like Bird? Over recent years, the overwhelming success of several startups like Uber and Airbnb has spawned an interest in the “sharing economy.” While many startups have emerged that essentially clone the proven functionality of the first-mover (like Didi, a multi-billion dollar startup directly competing with Uber), a lot more startups have focused on other aspects of transportation, hospitality and various other sectors. A promising new growth area that has emerged from this ongoing trend is electric bike and scooter sharing. Bird, a startup based out of Santa Monica, is a key player in the nascent industry which allows people to locate and rent the company’s electric scooters near them. Bird, and its competitors including Spin and LimeBike, have been driving the growth and adoption of this new mode of shared transportation in several U.S. cities over recent months. But how do these companies make money? And is their business model scalable enough to justify their rapidly growing valuations? We will answer these question in a series of articles, beginning with an overview of Bird’s gross profits per scooter and the factors that play a critical role in determining the profit figure as detailed in our interactive dashboard for Bird. The Business Model At A Glance Scooter-sharing startups like Bird essentially make money in the same way their much larger car-sharing counterpart Uber does – they offer electric scooters to people looking to travel short distances. The scooters are GPS-enabled, so anyone with the app can find one in their vicinity and rent it. The companies usually charge users a fixed fee per trip and an additional fee for each minute they use the scooter. However, there is a key difference between a scooter-sharing and a ride-sharing company: the former owns all the scooters it deploys on the road (and hence has to shell out cash for each scooter it adds to its fleet), while a ride-sharing service like Uber does not require any such upfront investment. Understandably, this has a significant impact on the profit-generating capability of the scooter-sharing business model – also because ownership of the scooter also means that the company has to pay for charging the electric scooter and for any other routine maintenance work. A Detailed Look At The Impact Of Key Drivers On Bird’s Profit Per Scooter Haje Jan Kamps, the director of portfolio at venture capital firm Bolt, shared a note on Techcrunch detailing the revenues and expenses for Bird per scooter under three different scenarios. We consolidated his back-of-the-envelope calculations into an interactive dashboard for Bird using our proprietary technology – making it easier to visualize the impact of changes to any of Bird’s key revenues and expense drivers on the company’s gross profits per scooter. As we pointed out above, the scooter-sharing business model requires the company to invest in the acquisition, charging and maintenance of each scooter – and as a result, calculating gross profits per scooter makes sense if the goal is to understand the scalability of the business. Bird’s Revenue Drivers – The revenues Bird generates per scooter depends on: Fee charged per trip, which is the fixed part of the revenue per trip: Bird currently charges users $1 per trip Additional fee charged per minute, which is the variable part of the revenue per trip: Bird current charges user 15 cents per minute for the total duration of the trip. Average duration of a trip, in minutes: The base case scenario assumes an average trip duration of 25 minutes. Number of trips for which a scooter can be used over its lifetime: The base case scenario assumes that the average life of Bird’s scooter is 300 trips (with 5 trips on average each day). Bird’s average revenue per trip under the base scenario is $4.75, as detailed in the chart above, which is equivalent to total revenues of $1,425 for the company over the assumed 300-ride lifetime of a scooter. Bird’s Expense Drivers The company’s core operating expenses are: Acquisition cost per scooter: The base case assumes that Bird spends roughly $400 to get a ready-to-use scooter on the road. This includes the cost of the scooter, and the cost of acquiring and installing a GPS tracker module on each scooter Charging costs: While the acquisition cost presents the single largest expense driver for Bird, the most significant expense driver on a day-to-day basis is the cost incurred by Bird to charge each scooter at the end of a day so that it is ready to use the next day. Cost to charge a scooter by Bird: The base case assumes that it costs Bird an average of $20 to charge a scooter each day. A majority of this figure is the cost incurred by the company to pick up each scooter from its current location, take it to the nearest charging point and to return it to an appropriate location once the charging is completed. Cost to charge scooter by users: It is much more economical for Bird if a user charges the scooter (which can be done at any available socket), which is why Bird reimburses a user $5 if he/she charges the scooter. Percentage of charges done by users: Under the base case, it is assumed that users charge the scooters 50% of the time, with Bird charging the scooters the remaining 50% Based on the assumption of 5 trips a day, the average charging cost of $12.50 per day per scooter works out to a charging cost of $2.50 per trip. Besides this, Bird would incur a maintenance fee (which is assumed to be $40 per week on average per scooter, or 29 cents per ride) and a small payment fee per trip (assumed to be 3% of the total trip fare, or an average of 14 cents per ride) – but both these costs are clearly dwarfed in comparison to charging costs. Under the base case, Bird incurs operating costs (charging+maintenance+payment) of roughly $2.93 per ride. Taken together with the revenue per ride of $4.75 detailed above, this works out to a gross profit of $1.82 per ride for the company. Aggregating these figures for the lifetime of a scooter (300 rides) and subtracting the acquisition cost of the scooter ($400) gives us a gross profit of $146.50 per scooter, as detailed below (or a gross margin figure of just under 10.5%) Clearly, a gross margin of 10.5% per scooter makes the business model difficult to sustain over the long run, as it doesn’t take into account any of the company’s other operating expenses. However, there are some simple changes detailed by Haje Jan Kamps that can be implemented by the company to boost margins considerably – with the primary focus being on reducing charging costs. We will detail the two proposed scenarios, and a company-level profit and loss analysis for Bird along with our estimate for its value in subsequent notes. What’s behind Trefis?

People in San Francisco are really pissed over these electric scooters,Vice,Vice Media Group,National,2018,5,2,"People in San Francisco are really pissed over these electric scooters. A fleet of app-controlled electric scooters were dumped on the streets of San Francisco last month. People hate them. Inspired by Uber and Lyft — and helmed by some of their former executives — a handful of companies are scattering electric scooter across cities first, then waiting for the law to deal with them. It’s a strategy, promoted by former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, called “principled confrontation.” Or as Euwyn Poon, cofounder of electric scooter company Spin, refers to it, “innovating on the regulatory side.” City officials call it something else: “illegal business activity.” In Santa Monica in September, Bird placed scooters on the city's streets, allowing customers to unlock them with a proprietary app. Santa Monica responded by filing criminal charges against the company, which were ultimately dismissed when the company pleaded no contest and agreed to pay $300,000 in fines. In San Francisco this month, the electric scooter companies LimeBike, Spin, and Bird all distributed their scooters across the city. Unsurprisingly, all three companies are arguing they shouldn't face penalties because there were no rules in place to regulate their particular mode of transportation. The companies see it as an emissions-free solution to the “last mile” often walked on foot or taken on a rideshare after using public transit. But residents complain that riders take the scooters on sidewalks and leave them parked across sidewalks, blocking ADA ramps and tripping unsuspecting pedestrians. Since their rollout, the companies have been negotiating with Santa Monica and San Francisco on how scooters should be regulated, and how the companies can get their riders to follow the rules.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d35m9a/people-in-san-francisco-are-really-pissed-over-these-electric-scooters
Scooters and Bikes Compete for City Streets,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,5,7,"Scooters and Bikes Compete for City Streets. Smaller, electric-driven sharing services could complement transit — if people use them. Earlier this year, Santa Monica-based startup Bird rolled out an app-based fleet of dockless electric scooters in San Francisco. The city is not its first location — it has scooters in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington — nor is Bird the only scooter-share company operating there. San Francisco, though, is home to some of the scooters’ most vocal opponents, who see them as sidewalk-clogging nuisances and potential dangers to foot traffic. Proponents (of which I am one!) see scooter sharing as yet another way to move people through cities, and they’re worth analyzing. In San Francisco, Bird riders are averaging 1.5 miles per trip. I pulled my own Bird ride data for the month of April (10 rides, all in Washington) and found that I traveled a slightly shorter distance on average. I also spent an average of $2.70 per ride. Jump, the operator of on-demand, pedal-assisted electric bicycles that was recently acquired by Uber Technologies Inc., says that its riders average 2.6 miles per trip. The Cheaper Mile Just how far are riders taking electric scooters and bikes? Bird scooters in San Francisco are being ridden less frequently than Jump bikes are in general but more than the company’s own target of three per day. If San Francisco has its way, the city’s total scooter fleet would be capped at 1,250 for six months — a figure lower than Bird’s own fleet, much less the total fleet including Lime and Spin scooters. For the moment, the market seems overserved. These scooters certainly aren’t toys; they can be a nuisance if riders don’t follow some basic rules. But my average speed during those April rides of 7.5 miles per hour was almost a third faster than the 5.7 mile-per-hour average speed of a city bus in Manhattan. Average rides are shorter than on Jump’s bikes, and the scooters aren’t great at steep inclines. What they are great at, though, is being a last- or only-mile option for quick, inexpensive movement. Like electric bicycles, the scooters accelerate briskly. Unlike bicycles, they’re friendly to pretty much any attire. (Also unlike pedal-assisted electric bicycles, scooters require riders to have a driver’s license, as scooters have a throttle.) Scooters are also easy to dispatch: A delivery van can hold a lot more charged scooters than bicycles, and that makes them easier to move to where and when they’re most in demand. Neither Uber nor Lyft Inc., nor any of their competitors, seem interested in the electric scooter market — yet. But Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi hinted last month where his company or its peers might become interested. He said the average trip distance wasn’t much different from the average distance of an Uber car ride. If scooter rides begin to encroach on that figure, or they induce significant new demand for electric travel at their existing average distance, then perhaps a scooter firm will be an acquisition target. Khosrowshahi also said that Uber “aims to provide a variety of transportation options to consumers.” Perhaps that’s the best way to think of scooters and whatever novel electric transport follows them: as flexible transport options a rider doesn’t need to own, can always access, and will select based on that day’s needs and wants.",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-05-04/electric-scooters-bikes-compete-for-city-streets
The electric scooter deluge is dividing San Francisco,CNBC,NBC,National,2018,5,7,"The electric scooter deluge is dividing San Francisco. In cities all over the U.S., electric vehicles have been popping up from companies like LimeBike, Spin, Bird and Uber’s Jump Bikes. These start-ups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to solve what some call the last mile transportation problem — the symbolic distance between public transit and the final destination. While consumers may be excited about this influx of new vehicles hitting the road, cities aren’t quite ready for them yet. Here’s how they work: First, you use an app on your phone to find a scooter or bike you want to rent. Then walk to it on the street. You unlock it by scanning a QR code on the handle and then you’re off. There’s a brake on one side and a throttle on the other that’ll propel you up to 15 miles per hour. In downtown San Francisco, the number of electric scooters has surged recently, introducing a host of problems, including people illegally riding on sidewalks, vandalization and parked scooters blocking the walkways. The city even began impounding scooters that are parked illegally. Aaron Peskin, an elected official from San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors has been swamped with thousands of complaints from frustrated residents, including some who have actually been injured by a scooter. The city’s laws require electric scooter operators to not ride on the sidewalk and to wear a helmet, but looking around this city you’ll notice that barely anyone is following these rules. “I don’t want these folks ending up in my hospital at the taxpayers’ expense,” Peskin said. “I want our sidewalks to be safe.” San Francisco will soon start seeing fewer scooters on the road. A new permit process will begin limiting the number of scooters to just 1,250 for the entire city and require companies to register them with the Municipal Transit Authority. But executives at these companies say this is just the beginning. Ben Bear a VP at Spin told CNBC that “consumer demand will win out in the long run.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/bird-limebike-and-spin-overrun-san-francisco-with-bikes-and-scooters.html
The creators of the Boosted board have launched an electric scooter-sharing service,The Verge,Vox,National,2018,5,17,"The creators of the Boosted board have launched an electric scooter-sharing service. Available now in Washington, DC. Electric scooter-sharing (and bike-sharing) services have inundated West Coast cities like Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and San Francisco over the last few months. Despite some complaints and some vandalism, it’s only a matter of time before they make it out East en masse, too. One of the first companies to give that a shot launched today in Washington, DC. It’s called Skip, and it was started by Sanjay Dastoor and Matt Tran, the same pair who created the Boosted board. The battery on Skip’s scooters lasts about 30 miles, and they have a top speed of around 18 miles per hour. Skip works like most other dockless scooter-sharing services: you find a free scooter using the Skip app, scan a code to unlock it, and take off. Skip charges a dollar per ride, and 15 cents per minute, according to a profile in TechCrunch today. You can leave the scooter anywhere within certain limits, presumably. (The company’s terms of service and privacy agreements aren’t live on its website yet.) Then, a team of volunteer “chargers” will be paid to collect ones that are running low on juice. One way Skip will try to set itself apart from competitors like Bird or Lime is by the quality of its scooters. Where those other companies use smaller, more lithe scooters created by Xiaomi, Skip has apparently modified much bigger and sturdier ones from a Singapore company called Minimotors. They have full suspension, a wider riding area, and headlights / taillights. Eventually, Skip will make its own scooters, according to TechCrunch. But the real point here seems to be that Skip wants its service to be all about scooters that feel safer to ride, while also using ones that are more durable than the competition’s. These are things that Boosted have become known for with its electric skateboards, so it’s not surprising to see Dastoor and Tran emphasizing the same qualities at Skip. (Dastoor left his post as Boosted’s CEO last year but remains on the board. Tran left a few months before him.) The other way Skip is trying to distinguish itself is in how it behaves. In other words, Skip isn’t going to try the same disruptive (and somewhat unpopular) strategy employed by its competitors. Instead of just dumping a few hundred scooters and seeing what happens, Skip says it got all the necessary permits before launching in DC. It also says it plans to work closely with city regulators to grow its scooter-sharing service before expanding to San Francisco. Dockless sharing services, whether scooter or bike variety, have drawn just about as much praise as they have rankled cities. It will be interesting to see if Skip’s more measured approach can do anything to shift that balance. While the startup boasts about $6 million in financing, thanks to an initial investment round led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, that’s a far cry from the hundreds of millions of dollars Bird and Lime already have to play with. As if that’s not enough, Uber’s in this space now, too.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17366460/skip-electric-scooter-sharing-boosted-board
Electric Scooter Charger Culture Is Out of Control,The Atlantic,,National,2018,5,20,"Electric Scooter Charger Culture Is Out of Control. “Bird hunting” has become a pastime and a side hustle for teens and young professionals, but for some it’s a cutthroat business. Every afternoon around 4 p.m., when school lets out, Brandon, an 18-year-old high-school senior in Los Angeles who asked to be referred to only by his first name, goes “Bird hunting.” He heads for his minivan and, on the drive home, he’ll swing through convenient neighborhoods, picking up about 13 Bird electric scooters along the way, tossing them into the back of his car. “I have a whole system,” he says. “I’ll go home, put the 13 I initially caught on the chargers. They’ll charge for about three hours until around 7 or 8 p.m.”—when Bird makes more scooters available for charger pickup. “Then I’ll go back out.” Over the course of the next few hours, Brandon loops around his Santa Monica, California, neighborhood collecting as many scooters as possible. He brings back his bounty and, as his parents sleep, neatly sets them up to charge in batches overnight. The next morning he wakes up early, eats breakfast, and drops them off in groups of three at designated Bird Nests, designated pickup areas for scooters, on his way to school. For performing this service, Bird pays Brandon, a contract worker, up to several hundred dollars a night. On one particularly successful night, Brandon brought home $600.

Riders can locate and unlock scooters using the company’s smartphone app, and after paying the $1 unlocking fee are charged 15 cents per minute during use. Birds are available in a growing number of American cities including Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Scottsdale, Arizona; Washington D.C.; and Atlanta. The scooters are all battery-powered and dockless, so they can be picked up or dropped off anywhere. But when night falls, what most riders don’t realize is that the scooters themselves are charged by a contract workforce. These people are known as “Bird hunters” or “chargers,” and they’re growing exponentially in number. Registering to become a charger isn’t hard. Unlike Uber or most ride-sharing services, Bird doesn’t require a background check or any kind of complicated registration procedure. It takes a few simple steps including registering your address and providing personal information, tax information, and bank-account information so you can get paid via direct deposit. If your application is approved, within a matter of days Bird will mail you three charging packs to get started. Charging a Bird doesn’t require a ton of electricity, so minus the labor cost, charging a few scooters overnight is essentially free—especially if you live in a large apartment building and can do so in your bike room. As Birds and comparable scooter-sharing services continue to expand, charging has become a popular way for high-schoolers, college students, and young professionals to earn easy money. Wait for it... Video cred: Katey S. pic.twitter.com/Cs30ORUcLX — Harry Campbell (@TheRideshareGuy) April 13, 2018 “Charging scooters for Bird is like Pokémon Go, but when you get paid for finding Pokémon,” says Nick Abouzeid, a 21-year-old charger in San Francisco. Several nights a week after work, he and his girlfriend go on walks around the city, collecting scooters and bringing them back to his apartment building to charge in the basement. “It’s really fun to grab a few scooters, charge them, and in the end it pays for a fancy dinner,” Abouzeid says. “It’s like a game and I would do it even if the prices were halved, which they probably will be.” Like Pokémon Go, when you enter “charger mode” the Bird app displays a real-time map of Birds across your area that require charging. The reward for capturing and charging these Birds can range from $5 to $20 depending on how difficult the Bird is to locate—and some can be really hard to find. Bird chargers have described finding Birds in and under trash cans, down the side of a canyon, hidden in bushes, or tossed sideways on the side of the street. “Finding the really hard ones is so awesome,” says Lucas, a young teenage Bird charger in L.A. who didn’t want his last name or his age listed since he technically hunts under his parents’ account. “It’s become a big trend at my high school. People are like, ‘Oh are you gonna charge tonight?’ I have friends send me Snapchats like, ‘I just got 18 in one night!’ or, ‘Look where I found this one.’ There’s definitely a sense of achievement in picking a lot of them up.” “I think so many teens are doing it because it’s a really easy way to make a lot of money on the side,” says Brandon. “Everyone loves Bird so when you tell people you’re a Bird charger they’re like, ‘Whoa! That’s cool, how do I do that?’ No one thinks it’s lame. My friends and I are pretty much in the tech crew [at school], so we found out sooner. But now popular kids are asking how they can sign up and get Birds.” Lucas says he goes out with friends nearly every night, and even when they don’t find tons of Birds, it’s still a fun, social activity. “It’s like a whole-city scavenger hunt,” he says. He even jokes that it would make a great date. But while Bird hunting is fun and games for some, other chargers take the job much more seriously. Charging in some cities, like San Diego, has become a cutthroat competition between workers where every last dollar counts. Hoarding in particular has become a problem in these crowded markets. Bird and other companies will pay a $20 reward for missing scooters, so some chargers simply keep the scooters in their garage until they’re reported missing by riders or the bounty goes up to $20, then claim the finder’s fees. Bird theoretically polices this behavior, and Brandon says he’s gotten a warning call from the company for hoarding, but the bad behavior has become commonplace and punishment is unevenly enforced. At a WeWork and just saw someone bring their Bird scooter into the building and up the elevator. Guess that’s one way to hoard and ensure that you’ll have a Bird scooter to rent / ride with by the end of the day. — Kevin Lee (@kevinleeme) March 29, 2018 Each scooter can also only be captured by one charger. In saturated markets, the race to quickly grab as many scooters as possible is fierce. “One time I pulled up to pick up a scooter, I got there maybe 10 seconds before the other guy did,” said one charger in San Diego. “He started yelling at me. He picked up a Bird scooter and started beating my car. I got the hell out of there.” “As a scooter charger you’re a legitimate bounty hunter. Whoever finds the scooter first and scans it—it’s theirs and they’re in charge of it,” he added. “Anything that happens to it between the time that you capture it and turn it in is your responsibility, just as a bounty would be.” Unfortunately, some never turn their bounty in. They steal the scooters and chop-shop them, piecing them out and selling the batteries for up to $50. “The Bird will chirp at you if you try to steal it, but they chirp so often that no one pays attention,” says Abouzeid. “No one would stop you or say anything. I can show you on the charger map which ones are stolen. The battery is always at 0 and they were last seen like 7 days ago.” Any time you try to move a Bird without unlocking it first, the chirping alarm will go off. A representative for Bird says widespread theft has not been a problem. As the charging community grows, some Bird hunters have sought to reduce their competition in nefarious ways. Several Facebook groups for chargers in different cities have cropped up. For one of them, in order to join, you’re asked to share a screenshot of your settings screen containing your login name, telephone number, and email. Rogue Bird hunters attempt to use this information to shut down your account or charge under your name with updated billing information. Some vigilante Bird chargers who will stop at nothing to retrieve lost Birds and claim the $20 rewards have been known to falsely act as official representatives of the company. When they see a person hoarding a scooter or group of scooters in their garage via the app, they’ll show up at the offender’s house and demand they release the Birds into their care. “This only really works sometimes,” says one charger. “If the person knows what’s up they can say, ‘Actually you’re trespassing on private property.’” Criminals and pickpockets have also begun to recognize Bird hunters as prime targets and can use the Birds to lure their prey to isolated areas. One scooter charger said he has been nearly robbed on two occasions and that he now won’t retrieve scooters that are left in strange places, for instance, at the end of a dark alley. “I’d tell anyone getting into this to be safe,” he says. “I’d say to others: Bring mace or a taser because there’s a lot of crazy people out there, even the [chargers themselves]. I’ve had people yell at me, threaten me. It’s the Wild West.” Still, interest in becoming a charger continues to rise. Harry Campbell, also known as the Ride-Share Guy, who covers the sharing economy on his site by the same name, says that if you get in early in a new market, there’s a lot of money to be made Bird hunting. “It really reminds me of the buzz from when Uber came out,” he says. “There’s sort of a palpable interest right now in charging. I’ve talked to everyone from gig-economy workers who are getting involved to a real-estate agent to even a lawyer who was doing it part-time.” Campbell’s article about how to sign up to become a Bird charger has been the number-one article on his site for the past 45 days, generating tens of thousands of page views. “It feels like Bird just fell out of the sky over the past three weeks in Atlanta,” says Jake Schmutzler, a 26-year-old product manager. “I’ve never been attracted to a gig-economy thing because I work full time and I would hate to deal with gig-economy customers, but picking up scooters for 20 minutes at night and making money while I sleep sounds like a good side hustle. My roommate and I travel the BeltLine and they are everywhere. And it’s only going to get bigger.” Lucas says everyone from his high school is getting in on it too. In the middle of our interview one friend texted him, “U wanna pool our money so we can rent a truck and charge Birds?” Brandon says that while he used to be mocked for the 2004 Toyota minivan he drove to school, his friends now commend its ability to transport large amounts of Birds. But while some tech observers and Redditors debate the moral implications of the charging economy, Abouzeid says that becoming a Bird hunter can feel like a good deed, almost like cleaning up the neighborhood. “You see them lying around on the side of a sidewalk,” he says. “As a charger you can pick them up, you take them home, take care of them, and leave them in a nice little row in the morning, ready to go for people. It’s really satisfying.” “I think it’s really fun,” says Lucas. “I’ll probably go charging this weekend.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/charging-electric-scooters-is-a-cutthroat-business/560747/
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters,New York Times,,National,2018,6,6,"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters. I wanted to hate the scooters. I really did. Before going to the Los Angeles region last week for work, I had heard about the area’s invasion by dockless, rent-by-the-minute electric scooters. I saw their sudden arrival described as a plague of two-wheeled terrors that had crowded sidewalks and endangered pedestrians, and I knew that some cities had issued cease-and-desist orders and passed emergency ordinances to get them off the streets. I also knew that Los Angeles’s leading e-scooter company, Bird — which reportedly just raised $150 million at a valuation north of $1 billion — was run by Travis VanderZanden, a former executive of Uber and Lyft. His new venture seemed to be an unholy mix of the former’s lawless arrogance and the latter’s saccharine branding. (A group of people riding Bird scooters is called a “flock,” Mr. VanderZanden has insisted.) Tech hubris on wheels — what’s not to loathe? But I wanted to experience the scooter craze for myself. So for a week, I used shared e-scooters as my primary mode of transportation. I rode them to meetings, ran errands across town and went for long joy rides on the Venice Beach boardwalk. In all, I took more than a dozen scooter rides, from just a few blocks to several miles. And here’s my verdict: E-scooters might look and feel kind of dorky, but they aren’t an urban menace or a harbinger of the apocalypse. In fact — sigh — they’re pretty great. My journey to e-scooter acceptance began when I saw an empty scooter outside my hotel. I downloaded the Bird app, entered my driver’s license and credit card information, agreed to some basic terms (no riding on sidewalks, no riding two to a scooter, no speeding downhill) and scanned a code on the scooter’s handlebar. The scooter beeped, telling me that it was unlocked, and I was off. Battery-powered scooters have been available for years, but only recently have they been outfitted with GPS trackers and wireless connectivity and arranged into on-demand fleets. These scooters are limited to 15 miles per hour, but that is still zippy enough to put a satisfying whoosh in your hair. And when you’re done riding, just park it anywhere, choose “end ride” on your app, take a photo to help the next rider find it and walk away. Rides are cheap (Bird charges $1 plus 15 cents per minute), and an abundant supply of scooters in Santa Monica meant that I was never more than a block or two from one. The rise of shared e-scooters is just one of several recent tech-powered experiments in urban mobility. Dockless bike-sharing programs, which have been popular in China for years, are starting to take off in America. The programs added 44,000 bikes in the United States during the last half of 2017, according to a report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Other wheeled innovations — like electric unicycles and skateboards — are also making gains. Like the earliest ride-hailing providers, many e-scooter companies have taken a cavalier approach to growth, dumping thousands of vehicles on city streets with no permits and little advance notice. This tactic has not endeared them to cities. Bird paid $300,000 in fines and other fees to settle a legal dispute with Santa Monica after the city sued it for operating without a proper license last year. Denver recently ordered Bird and LimeBike, another e-scooter provider, to remove their scooters, and Nashville and other cities have begun seizing scooters from their streets. (Citizen-led protests are happening, too — in San Francisco, scooters have been vandalized and thrown in front of Google buses.) Emerging technology should always be scrutinized, especially when it could involve health risks and strain public infrastructure. And new forms of transportation have always been controversial. (In the 19th century, critics of bicycles labeled them tools of the devil.) But people should think twice before condemning e-scooters as an ill-conceived tech-world fantasy. Because if you can get over their dopey aesthetics and dubious corporate strategy, e-scooters actually solve some problems. They’re lightweight and emission-free. They don’t require bulky docks or parking lots, and they’re perfect for trips that are too long to walk but too short to justify driving or hailing a car. If they take off, they could alleviate congestion and become a low-cost way of getting around cities without robust public transportation systems. Opponents of e-scooters typically make three major claims. But as I learned during my experiment in California, none of those arguments hold up particularly well under scrutiny. 1. Scooters are a public safety hazard. Anti-scooter activists tend to paint scooter riders as kamikaze daredevils, slaloming through cars and pedestrians. I did see a few instances of dangerous behavior — couples riding two to a scooter, people riding one-handed while taking selfies and some running red lights. There is also the issue of helmets, which many states require but which, as far as I can tell, no scooter riders are wearing. There have been five traffic incidents involving Bird scooters in Santa Monica since November, and 424 citations of motorized scooter riders, according to a Santa Monica Police Department spokesman. Bird, which declined to provide information about accidents, offers helmets to active riders for a $1.99 shipping fee, and about 30,000 people have taken it up on the deal. (The deal is available only to riders who live in a current Bird market, which excludes out-of-town visitors like me.) There is no doubt that scooters could be safer if helmet laws were better enforced and basic safety training was provided before riding. But it’s probably not time to panic just yet. We don’t have enough data to know if scooters are more dangerous than bikes, motorcycles or other types of two-wheeled transit, and scooter safety will most likely improve as riders get more experience and drivers learn to share the road. In fact, the only scary scooter rides I had were the times that cars veered a little too close to the bike lane I was riding in. If cities want to encourage safe scooter riding — and they should, given the benefits they have for congestion and environmental health — they should create protected scooter lanes and encourage drivers to give them more room. 2. Scooters are cluttering sidewalks, roads and other public spaces. This anti-scooter case was made most memorably by a columnist at The Los Angeles Times who complained that “these electric scooters are everywhere — roads, sidewalks, street corners, parking lots, boardwalks, apartment complex hallways — beeping while stationary and whirring when rolling, ridden mostly by stoic mannequins in flip-flops.” It’s true that scooters have gone from nonexistent to ubiquitous in a matter of weeks — one morning, I counted more than 100 within a few blocks of my hotel. But their visibility is a function of their novelty. We don’t view parked cars and bus stops as eyesores, even though they’re everywhere. This isn’t just about clutter — cities are worried that parked scooters will impede wheelchairs and block entrances. But there are easy solutions here. Just as we have parking meters for cars, cities could designate scooter parking areas on every block, and begin ticketing riders who leave their scooters in the middle of the sidewalk. Companies like Bird — which already pay armies of contract workers to recharge their scooters at night — could also give users small rewards for clearing badly placed scooters out of the way. 3. Scooters are annoying symbols of tech-world elitism. Some people object to e-scooters on political and symbolic grounds, claiming that they represent everything that is wrong with the tech industry. Critics have taken aim at their perceived elitism (you need a smartphone and a credit card to use scooter-sharing apps) and the sudden, permissionless way they were rolled out in cities, which fit a pattern of bad behavior set by tech companies like Uber and Airbnb. It’s true that scooter companies have not exactly covered themselves in glory. They have invited a backlash by flooding the streets with scooters with no explanation and little or no contact with local officials. As these companies grow, they will need to prove that they can cooperate with regulators, rather than trying to circumvent them. But there’s nothing inherently elitist about e-scooters. (In fact, at between $2 and $5 for most rides, they’re price competitive with public transportation, and far cheaper than services like Uber and Lyft.) And while e-scooter companies have moved brazenly into new markets, they have also shown some willingness to compromise in cities like Austin, Tex., where local officials required that scooters carry licenses and proof of insurance. David Estrada, Bird’s chief legal officer, told me that the company had cooperated with officials in Miami and other cities to plan orderly rollouts. He said the company obeys local laws and doesn’t introduce scooters in cities, such as New York, that expressly prohibit them. But he said that cities tended to drag their feet on new transportation policy, and that seeking pre-emptive approval for e-scooters could take years. “We’d have happy cities, but we wouldn’t have a business and we wouldn’t be solving a problem,” Mr. Estrada said. It’s possible that the skeptics are right, and that electric scooters will end up like Segways — novelty gadgets for big-city tourists. It’s also possible that they’ll end up like Uber and Lyft — a multibillion-dollar industry that spends years battling local officials but ultimately changes urban transportation as we know it. The answer will most likely depend on the regulations that emerge, and whether scooter companies can operate profitably in cities that, unlike Santa Monica, don’t have flat terrain and year-round sunshine. Whatever happens, you can count me as a slightly embarrassed member of Team Scooter. If liking fun, inexpensive, short-distance transportation is wrong, I don’t want to be right.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/technology/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-electric-scooters.html
Now the Personal Injury Lawyers Have Scooters in Their Sights,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,6,12,"Now the Personal Injury Lawyers Have Scooters in Their Sights. Accidents involving scooter riders in San Francisco and Los Angeles have law firms salivating over potential payouts. Bird Rides Inc. and other scooter startups have drawn fire from pedestrian advocates, politicians and annoyed citizens. Now they have a new nemesis: personal-injury lawyers. In recent months, people hurt riding (or hit by) scooters in San Francisco and Los Angeles have been calling legal firms to file claims. Smelling opportunity, firms have even carved out dedicated spots on their websites urging people to file scooter-related claims. “Our thought when we first saw them “flying” around Santa Monica and haphazardly abandoned on city sidewalks: This is an accident waiting to happen,” blared McGee Lerer & Associates. Los Angeles abounds with personal-injury lawyers on the hunt for cases. “Lawyers will be lawyers when there’s the potential for some money to be made,” says John Perlstein, a 25-year veteran who litigates accident claims referred to him by other attorneys. “Most of them are trying to keep the doors open and hope for a million-dollar case to come their way.” There are no records so far of lawsuits being filed against Bird or its rival Lime, but lawyers say it’s just a matter of time. The scooters began appearing in many parts of the U.S. last year. They can be unlocked with a smartphone for a buck, cost 15 cents a minute to rent and reach 15 miles an hour. The machines have proved popular—and polarizing. The companies see them as a logical next step to the transportation revolution started by Uber and Lyft. Foes consider the scooters an annoying fad among tourists and tech workers, who zip around imperiling themselves and others. Investors, who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into scooter startups, expect the machines to become a lasting feature of the urban landscape. Both Bird and Lime are in the process of raising large investment rounds to fuel their expansion. Though the scooter revolution is on hold in San Francisco while operators apply for permits, the machines are expected to re-appear within weeks as the city conducts a pilot program. They continue to weave through the traffic in Santa Monica and other cities. Accidents happen. Catherine Lerer, one half of McGee Lerer’s husband-and-wife legal team, says she got the first scooter-related call about five months ago. A 16-year-old boy had been injured falling from a Bird scooter, and the family wanted to make a claim. The phone has been ringing ever since. Many of the mishaps involve young riders who broke a collar bone or an arm in a single-rider accident, when the brakes locked or they lost control of the scooter, Lerer says. Los Angeles lawyers expect there to be more scooter incidents in LA, where the automobile famously rules, than in San Francisco, where cyclists, runners and cars compete for lane space. “Local drivers aren’t as used to sharing the road and also tend to drive more aggressively,” says Robin Saghian, a personal injury lawyer with Omega Law Group in Beverly Hills. In addition, scooter riders can be more reckless crossing intersections at fast speeds, which increases the chance of an accident, he says. “We’re getting about 2 to 5 calls a week and it’s getting more common,” Saghian says. The inquiries about scooter-related accidents, including by pedestrians who get hit by a scooter, have jumped since his firm posted a blog about the issue on its website in April. The McGee Lerer lawyers say they’ve heard of accidents involving single scooter crashes due to malfunctioning tires or brakes, road hazards, as well as pedestrians hurt tripping over scooters left on paths. They’ve seen children riding the scooters, people riding tandem without helmets, riders zipping along sidewalks and scooters left abandoned in the middle of sidewalks. California requires riders to wear helmets, have a driver’s license and refrain from carrying passengers, riding on sidewalks or leaving scooters on their sides. Santa Monica will soon vote on a pilot program to rein in scooter rental companies like Bird, according to the Los Angeles Times. The proposals would cap the number of scooters and apply tougher penalties for rule breaking. A rental company could lose its permit if it endangers public health or safety. Earlier this year, after a local woman collided with a motor vehicle and wound up in hospital, Bird began asking riders to wear helmets, supply a driver’s license and prove that they’re at least 18 years old. It’s not clear how strictly these rules are enforced. Lime asks users to wear head protection, too, and was offering riders a free helmet if they have an account balance of $10 or more. Bird also specifies that riders agree to use the scooters at their own risk and limits its own liability to $100. Perlstein says a waiver won’t bar claims for gross negligence. He also says Bird may be an easy target because as a startup it’s unlikely to have an in-house legal team willing to fight protracted lawsuits. Like Uber and Lyft, the scooter company may be more willing to settle before a lawsuit is filed, he says. Bird, which is based in Santa Monica, declined to comment. San Mateo-based Lime says it hasn’t been sued and is unaware of incidents involving people using its scooters. Lawyers say winning damages won’t be simple. Pedestrians who claim they were injured dodging a scooter on the sidewalk typically have no one to sue because the riders are long gone. Riders hit by cars probably have the strongest cases. “I have been turning away a lot of callers because I need to have an insurance company to go after,” Lerer says. She expects the number of accidents to increase, particularly on college campuses and heavily touristed precincts. “It’s like the plague,” Lerer says. “It’s spreading so fast.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-12/now-the-personal-injury-lawyers-have-scooters-in-their-sights
"As scooters, bikes, and transit startups flood the streets, cities need to control the curb",Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,6,13,"As scooters, bikes, and transit startups flood the streets, cities need to control the curb. With dockless scooters and other transit startups expanding, cities need to realize the value of the infrastructure they already control. Forget New York City’s crumbling subway system—the flood of dockless electric scooters is shaping up to be the key urban transportation story of 2018 as citizens in San Francisco and elsewhere become enraged over another example of tech companies barging in and begging for forgiveness instead of asking for permission (or simply waiting for regulations). In just the past week, local leaders in both Santa Monica, California, the market where billion-dollar startup Bird first launched, and San Francisco, introduced ordinances to restrict and regulate scooter usage. Both initially proposed capping the number dockless vehicles these companies can place on the road, and have been met with pushback by the startups. A Bird spokesperson initially told Curbed the proposed regulations “will severely undercut our ability to serve all of the neighborhoods and residents of Santa Monica.” The debate over restricting scooters may be a sign cities are finally beginning to catch up with transit startups, which often entered markets before any regulations were in place. But read the Santa Monica regulations, which were just approved, more closely, and signs of a more profound and important shift may be evident. Cities and planners are, more and more, seeing the immense value of controlling the curb. With more options that ever for getting around cities, and finite space, the question of how we use this infrastructure, and who controls it, is more important than ever. By regulating how these new transportation options evolve, cities can potentially bring about a more sustainable, multimodal, and less car-centric transit future. “The curb is an increasingly contested piece of urban real estate,” according to “The Shared-Use City: Managing the Curb,” a new report by the International Transport Forum. It’s where companies, citizens, and the government are jockeying for space for transportation, commerce, and delivery. Cities built and maintain the curb, and need to reassert ownership. The curb, an increasingly contested piece of urban real estate Venture capitalists and startups see a convergence around different mobility options in cities. Scooters and dockless bikes have arrived just as this larger transportation transition, started by ridehailing, is beginning to pick up momentum. There’s value in providing simpler, cost-effective, and car-free ways to get around. The new flock of transit startups seems poised to make a lot of money, if all these rosy valuations and the ridership projections behind them add up. The tech world certainly sees a lot of dollar signs when it comes to dockless mobility and bikeshare. After scooter startup Bird became a unicorn two weeks ago, announcing a new round of funding that would give it a $1 billion valuation, it recently announced plans to seek a $2 billion valuation. Competitors Lime and Spin are also flush with cash, especially after Google Ventures just invested $250 million in Lime. After reports suggested Lyft wanted to acquire Motivate, the national bikeshare operator that runs New York’s CitiBike system, other stories suggested Uber, which already purchased the electric bikeshare company Jump, is also interested in Motivate. What’s left out of these billion-dollar deals? Cities. Most of these transit companies don’t have plans to pay for street maintenance, enforce safety rules, or share the ridership data that cities could use to plan better and more efficient transportation systems. Yet cities are paying for and providing the public infrastructure—roads, sidewalks, and curbs—underpinning this private gain. Last year, many of the country’s biggest cities passed measures worth hundreds of millions of dollars to update and fix streets and sidewalks. But with the widespread adoption of mobile technology and GPS, the possibilities of a “self-adjusting curb” allow cities even more potential to shape and direct this rise in curbside traffic. Some cities have already had success with tests and trials that regulate access. “Santa Monica is a multi-modal city focused on carbon reduction,” a Santa Monica city spokerperson told Curbed. “We’re supportive of...the concept of Bird. They just need to operate lawfully and safely.” Washington, D.C., launched a successful trial in 2017 to regulate pick-up and drop-offs around the busy DuPont Circle area. San Francisco has used geo-fencing tools to “nudge” riders of Uber and Lyft to request pick-ups and drop-offs in designated zones to reduce congestion. These concepts, referred to as “flex-zones” by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) or Shared-Use Mobility Zones by the Eno Transportation Foundation, envision cities using rules and technology to give different transit options priority. For example, Seattle has adopted proposed guidelines for design that follows a flex zone framework. First, designate transit stops, transit lanes, and bikeways. Then, find spaces for bike share stations, commercials loading, perhaps geo-fenced areas for dockless vehicles. Then, fill in the blanks with parklets and pick-up and drop-off spaces for ridehailing and private vehicles. Finally, include an array of short-term car storage options via parking regulations. Why Santa Monica scooter regulations may be about more than scooters By laying out criteria for dockless mobility partners, and introducing user fees for fleet operators, Santa Monica’s pilot program show that transportation planners there are thinking about the quid pro quo of this new transit world. The document detailing the arrangement repeatedly underscores that the city wants an “open and productive partnership,” recognizing that scooters and other dockless vehicles can help the city achieve sustainability goals and offer a highly desired option for shorter trips. Companies vying for a spot in Santa Monica’s 16-month pilot program for shared mobility devices will be evaluated on a number of criteria, including safety, operations requirements, and data sharing. Each of the seven categories has minimum and recommended benchmarks. Taken as a whole, the recommended benchmarks read like a model for the kind of partnership that could allow technology to evolve while giving public transit officials the ability to oversee, analyze, and regulate. Operators are encouraged to offer low-income and multilingual options, create a system that recognizes geo-fenced parking areas dedicated to decreasing vehicle clutter, and provide real-time fleet info to the city. After some debate, the city approved a dynamic model for capping scooters based on vehicle utilization; both Bird and Lime issued statements praising the new framework. Other cities, looking to control traffic and fund the infrastructure used by these companies, have started to levy fees and rules on tech companies. A new fee Chicago officials added to Uber and Lyft rides will direct millions of dollars towards public transit investment, while designated drop-off spots are being tested in other cities to help avoid congestion. As these new mobility companies invest in larger fleets—and make private car ownership, a massive municipal revenue source, less attractive—cities will find more and more financial reasons to take control of the curb. The “Managing the Curb” report says cities need to prepare for the shift, and figure out how to price curb use to both control traffic and make up for any lost parking revenue (the top 25 U.S. cities made $2.8 billion on parking fines and fees in 2016). “Curb use will resemble dynamic, highly flexible, self-solving puzzles,” says the report, as our urban areas move from what it calls “parking cities” to “pick-up and drop-off cities”. Creating incentives creates a better system for all Regulations that stifle and kill these mobility innovations would be tragic. But wise rules that recognize the potential and pitfalls of these new forms of transit, and how they can make existing systems better, would be a huge benefit. Take two recent studies analyzing how ridehailing companies like Uber and Lyft impact urban traffic. The first report, released last October by University of California Davis transportation researcher Dr. Regina Clewlow, found that while widespread usage of these services may be decreasing the number of miles users drive themselves, it appears to increase the total miles driven in cities. The research found that 49 to 61 percent of ride-hailing trips “would not have been made at all, or made by walking, biking, or transit.” Last month, a study by Masabi, a mobile ticketing service that works with transit systems as well as companies such as Uber and Lyft, found that more than one-third of respondents said they were combining ridesharing with public transit on an occasional basis. Better coordination between public and private, and added incentives to steer riders towards this kind of shared system, can potentially work wonders when it comes to reducing congestion and decreasing car travel. When Chicago introduced its proposed tax increase on ridehailing companies, an Uber spokesperson said that the “future of urban transportation will be a mix of public transit and ride-sharing.” Many cities are already subsidizing Uber and Lyft rides, testing to see if the service can function as a first/last mile connection to existing transit systems. And scores of new planning apps have made it easier to plot trips that bounce between different modes, including dockless bikes. In addition, a shift in fees towards curb-access, as opposed to parking, can help cities monitor and control traffic. New York City and others have struggled to introduce congestion pricing. Why not just update existing parking laws to account to all the new mobility options on the road right now? To paraphrase the Santa Monica regulations, cities need to find good partners. In a healthy relationship, that usually means being upfront about boundaries and not being afraid to ask for what you need. Cities need to own the curb With so many new and developing transit options, it may seem like city streets are flooded with choices, as well as vehicles. There are extensive regulatory and safety issues at play to get all of these different ways of getting around to work together in a more cohesive manner. And while it may seem overwhelming, there is evidence that, if introduced with proper investment and oversight, these new options can work wonders. Just look at the success of traditional bikesharing, which in five years, went from unknown to a backbone of the transit system in New York City. The system racked up impressive ridership and safety stats because, according to a recent NACTO report, “as these systems were implemented, they were accompanied by policy decisions from city leaders and transportation engineers to ensure that cycling infrastructure improved to match their investments.” Dockless systems, for all the complaints that they’re unruly or disorderly, can work if properly regulated. According to an Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) report that analyzed both station-based and dockless bike systems, dockless bikeshare isn’t always the “disruptor” people make it out to be. “The best transit innovations—especially those that are privately operated—offer riders convenient, affordable options for getting where they need to go,” the report reads. “Local governments that have viewed dockless bikeshare as an extension of their transit systems and introduced some form of regulation have seen ridership flourish as a result.” Cities have a chance to do the same with the current influx of scooters and dockless systems and invest in more car-free travel lanes while regulating curb access. Many companies seem at least willing to work with cities toward these goals. Uber, Lyft, and many dockless bike companies signed a Livable Cities Pledge, promising to support the shared and efficient use of “vehicles, lanes, curbed, and land,” as well as push for open data and fair user fees. Bird promoted a Save Our Sidewalks pledge that even suggested the companies should pay a per-vehicle fee to fund infrastructure improvements, and after the recent Santa Monica vote, Lime spokeswoman Mary Caroline Pruitt said the company remains “committed to partnering together to promote safe riding, proper parking etiquette, and accessible sidewalks.” A recent app redesign from Lyft seeks to promote shared rides, and the company’s new goal to have shared rides account for half of all trips on the platform by 2020.

"Investors explain why they’re racing to get into scooter companies like Lime and Bird, driving valuations into the billions",CNBC,NBC,National,2018,6,14,"Investors explain why they’re racing to get into scooter companies like Lime and Bird, driving valuations into the billions. Lime and Bird are reeling in venture dollars in a hurry. Investors are loudly debating whether this is the future of transportation or the next Segway. The bike-sharing model has already turned into a multibillion-dollar industry in China. E-scooter start-ups are annoying and wildly overvalued, say the skeptics. E-scooters are super fun and poised to change urban transportation as we know it, say the optimists. Investors bidding up scooter prices are motivated not by fundamentals but by FOMO (fear of missing out), say the bears. But we all want fewer air-polluting cars on the roads, say the bulls. It’s one of the hottest debates in Silicon Valley. With Lime valued at about $1 billion and Bird reportedly raising money at twice that valuation, venture capitalists are betting that this fledgling market will grow rapidly as people working downtown and attending college on big campuses recognize a new affordable and efficient way to get around. “It is actually the closest thing we have today to last-mile autonomous transportation,” said Kyle Lui, a principal at DCM Ventures, which invested in Lime. “It can get you to a location faster than any other form of transportation.” But for every promoter of this futuristic view, there’s a dissenting voice saying that the unit economics will never work, and e-scooters will go the way of the Segway, not the skateboard. Residents of San Francisco, San Diego and Santa Monica have seen so many scooters pop up that the market already feels saturated. But in the vast majority of U.S. cities — the ones that Uber took years to hit — the idea of residents opening up an app that’s linked to their credit card and flying down sidewalks and bike lanes on a battery-powered scooter for a couple bucks remains a completely foreign concept. It started with bikes The market for last-mile transportation is rapidly evolving. Before 2017, municipalities were signing big deals with companies like Motivate, which provides bike-sharing systems that require docking stations spread across the city. Then a dockless system, first popularized in China, landed in the U.S. The main players in that market are Lime and two Chinese companies, Mobike and Ofo, which are expanding their fleets across U.S. cities. While most dockless bikes are cruisers with a few speeds, some are e-bikes with motors inside — Uber recently acquired e-bike maker Jump Bikes for about $200 million. In 2017, investors plunged $2.8 billion into bike-sharing start-ups, up from $343 million the prior year, according to CB Insights. Plenty of problems have popped up. China’s Wukong Bike closed last year after reportedly losing 90 percent of its bikes. “Operationally, the biggest hurdle for any bike-share operator (dockless or otherwise) is not losing bikes,” CB Insights wrote in a March report. Bikes are now giving way to scooter mania. In addition to Lime and Bird, there’s Spin and Skip (from the creators of Boosted electric skateboards). Just last week, Ofo said it will be deploying tens of thousand of e-vehicles in U.S. cities over the next few months, with scooters hitting markets including Atlanta, Austin, San Francisco and Santa Monica. Rides typically start at $1 and can go up to a few dollars depending on the distance. Bulls believe the market’s just getting started No matter how popular scooters are in certain places and how enjoyable they are to ride, the industry is going to be dogged by critics, at least for a while, for four main reasons: Valuation — Based on any reasonable numbers today, it’s hard to make the math work. The bet is on expansion, adoption and eventual profitability. Regulation — Every city is unique. They have different traffic rules for scooters, different ways of choosing which bike and scooter companies can operate and different requirements for the vehicles. For example, San Francisco forced all scooters off the roads earlier this month until they can get permits. And in Chicago, dockless bikes are being banned in favor of bikes that lock to racks. Sentiment — Images abound of bikes and scooters piling up on street corners and being tossed in dumpsters, while scooter riders cruising at 15 miles per hour on sidewalks are angering walkers who are used to staring at their smartphones in peace. Glut — There’s too much money chasing a fairly minor problem when so many companies addressing major problems have trouble getting funded. tweet Still, for those who have jumped on board the trend, there’s a certain sense of inevitability about its ultimate success. In downtown San Francisco, where traffic often brings cars to a standstill and a grid of one-way streets can turn a half mile car ride into a mile and a half, scooters provide the perfect mode of transit when walking isn’t an option. “It’s not going to be the use case of how do I get to work in the morning?” says Chris Nakutis Taylor, who spent five years at Uber and was hired to run Ofo’s North America business in October. “It’s the case of how do I get to that burger shop for only $1?” People who work downtown in cities of a few hundred thousand people may be a mile or two from their lunch spot. In the summer months it’s too hot and takes too long to walk. Public transit is often slow or unreliable, an Uber ride is more expensive and could get you stuck in traffic and driving may be a nuisance because of parking. Taylor used the tech industry’s favorite sports metaphor in saying the market is “still in the first pitch of the first inning.” He looks at cities in states like Indiana, where he was once an Uber general manager, and sees an abundance of opportunity. He also said that if you’re getting the business right, spending a couple hundred dollars on a vehicle that gets 20 rides a day (in the best markets) for $1 to $3 a ride, it doesn’t take that long for each one to turn profitable. “Transportation in cities is a big problem not solved completely by ride share and even autonomous cars,” said Alexis Ohanian, the Reddit co-founder who is now a venture investor at Initialized Capital. Scooters are “fun and frictionless to ride.” Ohanian’s firm invested in Skip, which currently operates in Washington, D.C. In the true spirit of the e-scooter market, where participants are simultaneously allies and bitter rivals, Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor told Business Insider last week that his company is the only one “without a cease and desist order.” tweet Vivek Ladsariya, a partner at SineWave Ventures, invested in Jump before the Uber deal. He believes e-scooter ventures can prove a mainstream success. But he’s skeptical of bike and scooter companies that have reeled in huge piles of cash before getting a clear view on how the economics will work and where they can operate. “All the problems that scooters face in cities still need to be figured out,” he said. To Ofo’s Taylor, the arguments about round sizes and valuations sound a lot like what Uber heard early on from the naysayers, who were shocked when the ride-hailing company was commanding even a $1 billion price tag. Its most recent reported valuation is $62 billion. The key, Taylor said, is moving beyond the coastal hubs and proving that sharing bikes and scooters is going to be an accepted model for transportation in every city where last-mile options make sense. “Uber didn’t become a $60 billion company by winning on the coasts,” he said. “If you don’t win Main Street in Anytown, USA, you’re going to be relegated to the edges.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/14/scooter-start-ups-like-lime-and-bird-why-investors-love.html
Denver’s new electric scooter pilot may complement mass transit,Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,6,20,"Denver’s new electric scooter pilot may complement mass transit. Scooter stations could be positioned near bus and light rail stops. Denver, another city wrestling with the question of what to do with the influx of dockless electric scooters on its streets, announced plans to develop a pilot program aiming to test how the newest mobility craze integrates with existing mass transit systems. According to the Denver Post, the program, which is still in development, would work through the city’s existing Transit Amenities Program, which allows for the use of mobility technology at transit sites such as bus and light rail stops. In theory, it would utilize the new transit option as a way to expand the effectiveness of the city’s growing transit system and advance its mobility plan. “As Denver continues to grow, it is critically important for us to encourage greater use of multimodal transportation options to reduce vehicle congestion,” said Eulois Cleckley, Executive Director of Denver Public Works. “We believe dockless technology has the potential to provide people with first-mile and last-mile links between their homes, destinations and public transit hubs more easily.” This proposed pilot comes on the heels of announcements by Santa Monica, California, and San Francisco, which have released their own plans for testing and regulating scooters. These city-initiated pilot programs for scooters and dockless transit options may be a sign cities are finally beginning to catch up with transit startups, which often entered markets before any regulations were in place, and trying to steer the development of transit technology. Santa Monica’s plan in particular details the arrangement between cities and these startups as an “open and productive partnership,” and will evaluate these companies on criteria including data-sharing and public safety advocacy and compliance. Denver plans to unveil the new pilot by June 29 and allow operators to apply for permits. Bird, a scooter startup now seeking a $2 billion valuation, and its competitor, Lime, intend to apply for a permit. On Monday, the city’s Department of Public Works ordered scooter companies to remove their vehicles from city streets for two weeks as officials figure out the details of the pilot program. The details of Denver’s proposed scooter regulation regime suggest the city is trying to utilize the new mobility option as a way to improve urban transportation, while balancing issues of public safety and sidewalk regulation. Ever since the scooters suddenly appeared on city streets on May 25, local officials have been fielding complaints from residents and trying to figure out what to do about the hundreds of new vehicles on city streets and sidewalks. Advocates see scooters as a way to reduce car-centric transportation and emissions while encouraging support of multimodal transit options and infrastructure.",https://www.curbed.com/2018/6/20/17485312/denver-light-rail-dockless-electric-scooters-transit
The downside to all those scooters and dockless bikes appearing in our cities,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,6,20,"The downside to all those scooters and dockless bikes appearing in our cities. There are few things more properly in the public sphere than urban transit. Yes, private transit — personal cars requiring expensive parking, limousines with chauffeurs — has always been a feature of urban mobility for the few. But publicly directed and publicly funded means of getting around our cities (such as public buses and subways, and publicly regulated taxis) have made modern urban life possible for the many. That may be changing. The latest example of the paradigm shift is appearing on the sidewalks of Washington and other cities. Walk down any street in downtown D.C. and you will see them: electric scooters and dockless bikes — parked everywhere and nowhere in particular. This is “public” transit, available for use by subscribers to various private services. The new two-wheeled transportation options are no casual amusement. In the past few weeks alone, private venture capital firms have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in their deployment at a time when subway systems in New York and Washington are struggling with operational woes and funding deficiencies. Billions more are likely to pour in soon. Who decided that our urban transportation grid needed scores of buzzing scooters and free-range bikes, instead of (for example) newer and cleaner buses or better- ­ functioning subways? Who weighed the respective claims of youth-friendly scooter-filled sidewalks against the desires of senior citizens or the disabled for more accommodating passage in our public spaces? The answers to these questions point to how much we have privatized “public” transportation and the subtle but important impact this shift can have. The most significant element of this shift has been the massive explosion of private ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft. These huge fleets have become alternatives not just to taxis but also to public buses and subways. A $7 UberX ride from point to point in a city has replaced a $2 subway trip for those with the means. The bottom line: If you have money and agility, there are many new ways to get around town using private services as an alternative to a public bus or subway. Moreover, the shift to private-“public” transit will only accelerate in the future. Tech giants Uber and Google are working on driverless vehicles as the next big thing in urban transportation. While a public high-speed rail initiative launched by the Obama administration was torpedoed by political opposition, Elon Musk’s privately owned hyperloop and underground boring projects appear to be the “trains” of tomorrow. None of these innovations are all good or all bad. They provide improved transit for some users and may reduce carbon emissions, while negatively affecting other urban dwellers and potentially eroding support for mass transit. The point, however, is that we have largely shifted the decision-making about how people should get around our cities from public authorities and public investments to private companies and private investors. The change reflects deliberate choices in public policy. During the Obama years, Republicans fought fiercely against any increase in public investment in mass transit and advanced rail systems. In 2016, decrying the crumbling state of our public infrastructure, President Trump promised that he would pass the largest infrastructure bill in U.S. history during his first 100 days in office. More than 500 days into his presidency, the bill still hasn’t even been drafted. In the meantime, Trump’s tax cuts put a further squeeze on state and local efforts to pay for improvements on their own by repealing the state and local tax deduction under federal law — hampering the ability of those governments to raise increased revenue from their citizens to pay for needed projects and services. Where does that leave us? In a “this is not the Onion” moment last week, Domino’s announced it was launching a new program whereby it would fill potholes and make repairs in cities where the state of the roads was slowing pizza deliveries. While this act of generosity should be applauded, what does it say about the state of civic resolve to maintain our public infrastructure when its condition turns not on public action but on the priorities of a pizza maker? Laboring under constrained budgets and without promised help from Washington, state and local governments can do little but watch their roads and sidewalks become laboratories for transportation innovation that will benefit some but not others. Upscale gentrified areas will soon be rich with autonomous cars, electric scooters and dockless bikes — while other populations will struggle with aging buses and creaking subways. Private investment and private innovation are great things. But private players are driven by profit motives, not public benefit. Regulation of these new modes of transport is one important means of ensuring that they serve the public interest; increased public investment in infrastructure and mass transit is also vital. The roads and sidewalks belong to all of us, and a robust public transportation system — fully accessible and usable by all people in all parts of a city — benefits all of us.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-downside-to-all-those-scooters-and-dockless-bikes-appearing-in-our-cities/2018/06/20/9e492c74-73f6-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html
"Electric-scooter companies conquer with a simple strategy: Act first, answer questions later",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,6,22,"Electric-scooter companies conquer with a simple strategy: Act first, answer questions later. At first glance, it looked like a painful defeat. Mere weeks after they had blanketed Miami streets, electric scooters disappeared overnight, their companies sent packing by city attorneys with cease-and-desist letters in hand. The scooter rental companies’ preemptive approach in some ways resembles Uber’s “disruptive” playbook: Bumrush new markets, ignore local regulations, turn riders into voters — act first and apologize later. In Miami — as in San Francisco and Austin before it — companies were able to prove that a market for electric-scooter rentals existed before they could be shut down, quickly creating loyal customers and amassing valuable transportation data before coming to the table to negotiate with city officials. The same sequence of events has played out in cities targeted by scooter rental companies across the country, often with victorious results. With typical Silicon Valley self-assuredness, Bird — a popular scooter start-up banished by frustrated Miami authorities — portrayed its recent clashes with city officials as less a fight than an inevitable part of the process of introducing innovative technology. Each time it arrives in a new city, the company says, it’s not sure whether Bird will encounter resistance or open arms. “We enter markets where scooters aren’t prohibited, and we follow the laws on the books,” Kenneth Baer, a Bird spokesman. “But in most cities, the laws never anticipated this technology.” Bird said the company is working with Miami officials to create an ordinance regulating scooter firms. Companies such as Bird and bicycle and scooter rental firm Lime expect to return to Miami in the near future, but this time they’ll have thousands of riders on their side, as well as some prominent political backers. “I’m a big fan of the electric scooters,” Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said, noting that he considers himself a technology-friendly mayor. “I think they’re a first-last-mile transit alternative.” Suarez noted, “In a city as hot as Miami, having a device that allows you to travel and get a significant distance with the breeze on your face could be a key to unlocking a transit system that has been a little bit underwhelming, to put it mildly.” From their critics’ perspective, electric-scooter-rental companies arrive in virgin territory overnight, unleashing chaos and fear before eventually recruiting amenable locals to their ranks, filling their coffers and moving on to the next conquest. From the perspective of their customers, electric-scooter startups are a desperately needed supplement to underdeveloped transportation systems. Their futuristic technology takeover is inevitable, scooter fans maintain, and city officials need to catch up, even if the initial launches feel abrasive. However bullish it seems, the strategy of act first, answer questions later seems to be working. After companies deposited 2,000 scooters on San Francisco streets in March, furious public officials responded by impounding the scooters and issuing cease-and-desist orders. The city is now considering a pilot program that would allow companies to put 2,500 scooters for rent on city streets beginning in July, according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority. During the scooter rental company’s first 30 days in San Francisco, Bird says, 32,000 riders took 95,418 rides, traveling 143,725 total miles. During the Lime scooters’ brief time on the streets of Miami, more than 10,000 Miami residents and visitors took 30,000 trips, saving almost 32,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, the company claimed. Lime is operating in more than 70 cities around the country. Darren Weingard, head of government relations for Skip Scooters, told USA Today that his company decided not to launch after they learned San Francisco was planning to regulate the new form of transportation. His rivals went ahead, he noted, unleashing a preemptive strategy that looks awfully familiar. “Some of what we were seeing [with rivals] seemed out of the old Uber playbook,” Weingard told USA Today. “We didn’t want to follow that.” Similar struggles have played out in Denver; Santa Monica, Calif.; Washington, D.C.; Nashville and Austin, where scooter rental companies have swooped into town with little warning before seeking constructive talks with city officials who had pushed back. After being pulled from the streets, scooter rental companies say they often expect to be back in the market in a few weeks — sometimes earlier, as cities rush through permits to meet the sudden demand for their services. The smoothest scooter rollout to date, by most accounts, has been in Memphis, where officials introduced a 30-day operating agreement ahead of Bird’s launch, according to the Commercial Appeal. The city council is expected to vote on an ordinance regulating scooter rentals next month. “This is just something that can prove to the world that Memphis is ready, that Memphis is open to business, and that Memphis makes accommodations for things we want,” council chairman Berlin F. Boyd told the paper. Memphis leaders said they decided to get ahead of the scooter wave after watching it crash into Nashville. After scooters appeared on sidewalks in the state capital, city officials threatened to impound them, arguing that they represented illegal obstructions of rights of way, according to the Commercial Appeal. Bird’s attorney initially pushed back in Nashville, arguing that the city was “grossly exceeding” the parameters of the city code, before the company decided to remove its scooters and work with city officials on permitting, the paper reported. Even if Nashville had refused to negotiate with Bird, the question is how long they could’ve held out before incurring public pressure to bring back the scooter rentals. The city is home to music festivals and sporting events, the paper noted, ideal venues for alternative forms of transportation. Hundreds of rental scooters had already been deposited across town, giving the public a taste of cheap, electric mobility. “It goes viral very quickly,” Baer said. “People like it. It solves a problem for them, and it’s fun.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/06/22/electric-scooter-companies-conquer-with-a-simple-strategy-act-first-answer-questions-later/
"In the Scooter Wars of 2018, it's not really about the scooters",USA Today,USA Today,National,2018,6,27,"In the Scooter Wars of 2018, it's not really about the scooters. There’s one thing the aggrieved voices in this city’s Great Scooter War of 2018 can agree on: It’s not really about the scooters. In three short months, these electric-powered gizmos that promise freedom from urban gridlock have become symbols in a larger struggle over the way the technology boom here has made the region one of the nation's wealthiest and least affordable. That tension often stems directly from the way startups treat this city as their personal petri dish, leveraging its infrastructure and citizens to disrupt established businesses while making a mint in the process. First came massive luxury buses often blocking city streets as they picked up workers heading to sprawling tech campuses. They were followed by legions of Uber and Lyft cars clogging dense downtown zones. Then came the scooters. Their corporate leaders say they're providing a quick and easy mode of transportation that doesn't pollute the air and helps take cars off the streets. But for every every happy hipster zipping past snarled traffic on an app-connected Lime, Bird or Spin scooter, there's someone else who sees that commuter as a reminder of the role upwardly mobile tech workers have played in changing the face of a once bohemian enclave where the median house price now is $1.6 million. ""This is a political backlash against what is perceived to be, rightly or wrongly, a very arrogant gilded age-style approach toward public space by tech companies,” says Jason Henderson, San Francisco State University professor and author of ""Street Fight: The Politics of Mobility in San Francisco."" That's why after a March rollout that initially seemed to delight, the rentable devices that generally charge $1 to unlock, 15 cents per minute of use, quickly became a lightning rod. The hashtag #scootersbehavingbadly trended, accompanied by photos of the offenders strewn about sidewalks like neglected toys. Out of spite, some scooters even were flung into trash cans, trees and the bay, smeared with feces or slapped with stickers covering the codes that allow riders to unlock them. After receiving swelling complaints to a hotline, city officials decided to pull all the scooters on June 4. Pending regulations, they are likely to bring them back in July in a pilot program of up to 2,500 scooters split between five companies. SF: Scooters symbols of 'arrogance' While similar scooter skirmishes are raging across the nation – Denver; Santa Monica, California; Washington, D.C.; and Austin, Texas, are just a few cities hosting heated debates – the schism here is particularly feisty. San Francisco supervisor Aaron Peskin calls scooters ""symbolic of the tech arrogance we’ve been dealing with for years,"" while housing activist Laura Clark of YIMBY Action declares ""we’re fighting for the soul of our city, and that’s about housing, not scooters.” In the process of leaning on a tech dictum that prioritizes asking for forgiveness rather than permission, tech companies often rile up city officials, activists and citizens. Flare-ups between residents and techies have always generated protests, and in a telling piece of political theater, activists recently used a pile of scooters to block a Google bus. The drama leaves many scooter company execs miffed. ""We're just trying to get people out of cars; there's a CO2 crisis,"" says David Estrada, chief legal officer for Bird. The novelty of the scooter phenomenon is partly what caused people to gripe, says Euwyn Poon, Spin’s co-founder and president. “But this isn’t tech for tech’s sake,"" he says. ""Mobility is a universal product.” A Lime scooter waits for a rider in Oakland. Across the bay, in San Francisco, rental scooters hit city streets three months ago, but were yanked following public protests. Caen Contee, co-founder of Lime, adds that profit motives aside, the aim is to help cities deal with growing congestion issues. “We’ve always known this is a passionate space that touches on issues of urbanization and gentrification,” he says. ""So while we may use tech in the scooters, our business has a larger mission.” Representatives of all the major scooter companies stressed in interviews that they met with city officials here ahead of launch. Most were keen to start small, testing the concept in limited locations. But suddenly there was a rush to market when some companies decided to act first and negotiate later. One company, Skip, deliberately held out when it heard San Francisco was going to consider regulations, a move executives hope will win them points with socially conscious riders when scooters return. ""Some of what we were seeing (with rivals) seemed out of the old Uber playbook"" of starting operations and then battling cities, says Darren Weingard, head of government relations for Skip Scooters. ""We didn't want to follow that."" Look for $1 billion scooter companies If you think scooters might be going away because of the hubbub, think again. Lime recently raised $250 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Google Ventures. Bird raised $150 million in a round led by tech investors Sequoia Capital. They've amassed these towering sums by pitching an eco-friendly solution to ""last-mile problems,"" which refer to short distances commuters face that may not be well served by hopping into a car – the very solution initially offered by Uber and Lyft, which also have submitted applications for San Francisco scooter permits. What San Francisco officials want isn't so much to get rid of scooters, but rather to have more of a handle on how they proliferate and operate. ""If this is a good last-mile solution, it should be on our terms, not theirs,"" says city supervisor Peskin, echoing the feelings of his peers in cities from coast to coast. Across the country, reactions to the scooter invasion have followed a familiar pattern that includes quick adoption by some residents who love the convenience and hastily scrambled meetings by officials who worry about scooter chaos. In Santa Monica, where tense relations between Bird and city officials led to a $300,000 fine, city council members recently hammered out scooter rules covering maintenance of the devices, education of riders and data sharing on the part of companies. In Austin, officials have kicked off a permit-based pilot program that requires scooter companies to carry insurance and encourages scooter riders to leave the devices at bike racks instead of scattered along sidewalks. In Denver, city officials are busy writing regulations and are impounding scooters found creating a public nuisance. Suffering from 'innovation overload' But for some frustrated by the scooter onslaught, fighting technology and Silicon Valley’s insistent creep into our lives is what the scooter battle is really about. Without being consulted on their deployment and use, San Francisco pedestrians this spring suddenly were tripping on scooters being left haphazardly on sidewalks or were forced to dodge people buzzing along at up to 15 miles per hour. That frustration was only amplified given the increased public scrutiny of tech companies such as Facebook and Google over data privacy issues. “Society is showing signs of suffering from innovation overload,” tech industry futurist Paul Saffo says. “On the one hand, people are fascinated by novelty, and on the other hand for some it’s just getting to be too much.” But a whiplash reaction to scooters by lawmakers risks torpedoing what could be a viable solution for cities looking to lure employees with sensible commutes, says Matt Brezina, a San Francisco bike safety advocate and tech investor with a stake in Spin. “Cities have to think about if they overregulate this. What do they want more of, more people on scooters or more people in cars?” Brezina says. “They need to give technology a fighting chance against the car.” San Franciscan Alex Ritchey exemplifies that duality. The tech worker loves scootering to work past this city's iconic Ferry Building on his personal sleek all-black ride he purchased about a month ago. “This scooter has changed my commute from spending $10 a day on Uber on a 40-minute ride to zipping along on this for 20 minutes,” says Ritchey, who works at tech company Hearsay. But, he adds, “I’ve seen so many people who are so reckless on these things, like three people riding on a scooter or people texting while riding a scooter.” Like many locals, Ritchey loves having access to an alternative, low-cost, green way to commute, but he’s not thrilled about the way the two-wheeled scooter revolution has come to town. “Overall, I’m pro-scooter,” he says. “But I don’t know if I’m pro-Lime, Bird and Spin.”",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/06/21/scooter-wars-2018-its-not-really-scooters/694274002/
Let’s Talk About All Those Electric Scooters,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,7,1,"Let’s Talk About All Those Electric Scooters. Little vehicles are changing the landscape of urban transit as cities struggle with how to regulate the fast-moving technology. In less than a year, a group of fast-growing electric scooter and electric bicycle companies have stocked U.S. city streets with lightweight, dockless, connected vehicles. To some, they’re a tech bro nuisance and yet another manifestation of Silicon Valley overreach; to others, a brand-new method of urban transit for the first, last or only miles of daily travel. Bloomberg Opinion’s Virginia Postrel and Nathaniel Bullard corresponded via email on the electric scooter craze; this is a lightly edited version of that conversation. NB: Since you’re in Los Angeles: Given that the scooter business in the U.S. kicked off in Santa Monica, and that the city recently passed a pretty forward-looking pilot program, is there something uniquely SoCal about scooters? As opposed to, say, uniquely San Francisco (where Uber began)? VP: Starting with the riders, Southern California has several advantages for a dockless scooter business. The traffic is awful, so people are looking for ways around it, especially on short trips. The weather is good, without much rain. On major arteries, the sidewalks tend to be wide and not jammed with pedestrians or, thanks to rather absurd regulations, with outside café seating or street vendors. Although you’re supposed to ride the scooters in the street, people do so only rarely. It’s much safer to ride on the sidewalk. As a major pedestrian, I don’t find scooter riders to be a problem. Also, many Southern California beaches already have boardwalks with separate lanes for bicyclists and roller skaters, so it’s easy to add scooters to that mix. The first place I saw scooters in heavy use was around UCLA, and the area’s many sprawling college campuses are another plus. They offer an easy early market. As the skateboard racks at Cal State-Northridge attest, scooters are also an easier-to-use version of a well-established form of sidewalk transportation. (You may have seen that California is debating whether surfing should be the state sport and getting pushback from skateboarding advocates. I’m with the skateboard faction.) The other half of the equation is important, too, possibly more so. It isn’t enough to find people to use the scooters. You also need people who’ll pick them up and recharge them. (This Atlantic article on “Bird hunters” is terrific.) For that, you need people with cars, preferably larger ones, and space to store the scooters overnight. In your column on scooters, you introduced the powerful concept of a “desire path,” the previously unarticulated consumer need that they serve. You wrote: That desire path isn’t “I like to ride on the sidewalk.” Rather, it is “I want a service that isn’t a car, can travel a few miles in a personalized fashion, and can be parked off the street.” I doubt that any city could have clearly articulated, much less quantified, this “last mile” demand prior to the introduction of vehicles that could meet it. Scooter users might not have been able to quantify that need, either, until there was an opportunity. How do you see this concept interacting with regulation and permissionless innovation, especially in the transportation arena, which tends to be highly regulated? NB: It’s a very good question, because if we think of these scooters (or little vehicles in general) as part of a transportation system and not toys, then they exist in an established, fairly rigid environment. They’re part of a transport system just like a subway — the difference being that no one can raise venture money, contract with a Chinese manufacturer and flood a city with subways overnight! The only thing that’s faster to deploy than scooters and bikes are ride-hailing companies, because they needn’t provide any hardware at all. I lived in San Francisco when Uber launched. It felt like magic to me — an act of divination to bring a previously hard-to-arrange service right to me. I don’t think that Uber could have launched with permission, rather than forgiveness. It would have taken too long, it would have involved even more resistance from incumbent oligopoly taxi and livery companies, and it wouldn’t have been able to iterate rapidly. That’s why I’m so interested to see how quickly, and willingly, scooter companies are engaging with regulators and being quite transparent about use patterns and growth intentions. Bird’s Save Our Sidewalks pledge is a good example of trying to get ahead of regulators. E-bike startup Jump — which is now owned by Uber — said the following in its filing to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency: We believe it is best to coordinate efforts through official City agency channels to ensure outcomes are aligned with the public interest. We are excited that the SFMTA permit process is now published, and commend the agency for taking a bold step toward increasing shared electric vehicles across the city. That’s about the least Uber-like sentiment ever, for those of us who remember how Uber began! Last thought here: Big transportation infrastructure is regulated out of necessity because of the number of counterparties involved. You couldn’t do an unpermitted subway because it requires infrastructure. You can do an unpermitted ride-hailing or dockless “little vehicle” business because the roads and rights of way already exist. You can do an unpermitted ride-hailing company without even buying any hardware, when people drive their own cars. But — and this is big distinction between ride-hailing and little vehicles — little vehicles are fleets, owned by a company. They can be confiscated or impounded, and then there’s no business to be had at all. Perhaps that’s why we see this move from permissionless innovation (or initiation) to seeking smart regulation happening so rapidly. Or, am I not being cynical enough? Do you think companies would much rather ask forgiveness forever than get permission early on? VP: You got me thinking about the big difference between rail and other forms of transportation. Little vehicles are the norm. Rail is the exception. The usual pattern is that a method of transportation exists and whatever comes along next starts by using the infrastructure that’s already there. People walk. Then they start to use animals or sledges along the paths they’re already taking. Then maybe they develop wheeled vehicles. They first use the old paths, then start to widen and improve them to make wheeled travel easier. Bicycles and automobiles didn’t use new infrastructure in the beginning. They simply rode on the existing roads and pathways. You could tell a similar story about waterways. People didn't build canals before they started using boats. The infrastructure improvements, coordination, informal habits and formal rules of the road come over time, as people discover what’s needed. Rail is different because the technology demands a particular infrastructure that doesn’t already exist. It’s less adaptable, and you have to do a lot of coordination and advance planning. Indeed, up until the Civil War, different jurisdictions regularly adopted their own rail gauges as a way of forcing railroads to “break bulk,” then load everything onto new railcars. It was horribly inefficient but created local jobs. As I wrote back in 2013, the Silicon Valley model of self-driving cars is more promising than earlier visions because it doesn’t require starting with new infrastructure. It allows trial-and-error experimentation and competing ideas rather than forcing everyone to agree in advance on just how we’ll use such cars. With cars, of course, there’s more coordination and regulation than with little vehicles, but it’s the same general pattern. As for Save Our Sidewalks and the Jump filing, I think it’s as much about business profitability as it is about staving off regulation. They don’t want to repeat the mess that dockless bikes went through in China, which would be a quick trip to business disaster even without regulatory threats. One of the interesting aspects of all this is that it involves Silicon Valley in negotiating what the cyberpunks called ""meatspace"": not just code but the physical world. Startups have to invest in — and maintain — inventories of scooters and bikes or whatever. Maybe ""sharing economy"" companies like Uber and Airbnb marked a transitional phase, and going forward we’ll see the Silicon Valley ecosystem creating businesses that themselves need more infrastructure. NB: Ah, meatspace. That meatspace issue — spending much, if not most, of your time working in an abstract way with code but having it manifest itself in physical space with human interaction and implication — is very important for these companies. People do all kinds of things in meatspace, such as fall in love, get into deadly accidents and commit acts of violence (even if they might initiate them online), that have serious implications for human lives. They’re also not things that are automatic first-order effects of digital technology, but which a cynic might predict — such as using Pokemon Go to mug game players. Is that something that transportation companies should be considering? I’d argue that they should be discussing them, at the board level: When will someone use this to fall in love? To commit a crime? What will be the first accident caused by it, and which is the first accident that that involves it but isn’t its fault? What will be the first fatality? And what response should we be prepared to give, having thought ahead about our role as facilitator or agent … or are we going to deny responsibility or involvement? I think that many technology companies want it both ways. They want to be instrumental in change, but they also don’t want to be responsible for ill effects even if those effects are third-order and completely unintended. They want to be positive but neutral in making connections, but as this fantastic 2014 essay from Jan Chipchase states, “Connectivity is not binary. The network is never neutral.” Code and business models are ethereal; the promises they make can be utopian. The streets are the streets, hard physical edges full of things that you might not expect but that you have to deal with nonetheless. There’s this meme that tech culture is solving one problem: “What is my mother no longer doing for me?” Or, as George Packer put it in 2013, “It suddenly occurred to me that the hottest tech start-ups are solving all the problems of being twenty years old, with cash on hand, because that’s who thinks them up.” I thought of these ideas when reading this series of interviews with European venture capital investors who have looked at scooter companies, who came away mostly nonplussed. Why? Because they solved problems that were far less prevalent in better-planned cities with abundant public transportation options. For some Europeans, scooters are a solution searching for a problem, because the cities they operate in don’t have the last-mile problems of the U.S. Mom, in this case, is public planning, policy, budgeting and infrastructure spending, and societal priorities — and I guess she’s not doing them anymore for the U.S. VP: I think you underestimate the appeal of personalized transportation, whatever the type. There’s a reason I prefer to walk rather than take the bus. But we can leave it at that.",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-07-01/electric-scooters-bikes-are-transforming-urban-transportation
How cities should regulate the scooter surge,Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,7,11,"How cities should regulate the scooter surge. A new report comes to the reasonable conclusion that cities should be more forceful in controlling their own streets. When the history of the great micromobility wars of 2018 is written, readers will quickly notice a cycle repeating itself. Companies, unbeknownst to city officials, add dockless bikes or scooters to streets and sidewalks. Residents attempt to figure out how to coexist with the flocks of new vehicles cropping up on roadways and right-of-ways. Local officials, responding to public pressure, then ban the vehicles or enact pilot programs to rein in the proliferation of cycles and scooters. The underlying promise of these vehicles—an accessible, car-free, and more sustainable way to get around the city—can seem a bit utopian when contrasted with the reality that these companies should be vetted, regulated, and evaluated by the cities in which they operate. That’s why “Guidelines for the Regulation and Management of Shared Active Transportation,” a new report by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) shared with Curbed, comes along at such an interesting time. The guidelines lay out potential rules and regulations for the nascent—and fast-growing— world of electric scooters and dockless bikeshare, collating current examples from more than a dozen cities with existing policies, permitting fees, and ideas for equity programming. In many respects, the NACTO report offers common-sense recommendations, beginning with the not-so-radical idea that cities—which have the financial and legal responsibility to build, maintain, and protect the local transit system—should have a say in deciding what vehicles are allowed to use said streets. The obviousness of the report’s considered and sober point of view only underlines how transit tech startups, in their rush to secure market share and increase valuations, may be rushing to scale, but, in the process, become their own worst enemies. It also comes not a moment too soon. Both Bird and Lime, leaders in dockless scooters, have valuations over $1 billion, making the startups so-called unicorns. This means each has added pressure to rapidly expand and justify those eye-popping financials. With Lyft purchasing the nation’s largest bikeshare operator and Uber just announcing plans to make Lime scooters available via its app, there’s even more reason for these services to proliferate. The fast pace of developments in the micromobility space only underlines the need for cities to enact rules as soon as possible. The NACTO report comes down hard on the common practices of tech transit companies, that tend to beg for forgiveness as opposed to asking for permission. Ever since this new breed of what the authors call “shared active transportation rentals” began entering U.S. cities in 2017, they’ve operated “absent contracts, permits, or business licenses, often completely independent of municipal knowledge, policy-making, or existing partnerships and community programs.” Due to differing and sometimes incomplete regulations, ebikes, scooters, and electric scooters “exist in a regulatory grey area, regulated in a limited fashion on an individual or recreational level but not envisioned en masse or in an automated rental scenario.” The NACTO report offers a few starting points for cities that want to design pilot programs to help these companies expand. These proposed rules of the road offer a pretty easy template for cities to adopt. Most importantly, they should take control of the street and the curb. New startups also should require legal permission, which can cap the number of vehicles in operation, and be subject to fines or expulsion if rules or regulations are flagrantly or repeatedly violated. Cities must should push for data-sharing, transparency, and safety. Agreed-upon rules to clear disabled or downed vehicles from right-of-ways should be strictly enforced, cities should be aware of staffing and operations plans, protocols for extreme weather or natural disasters should be clearly laid out. Additionally, companies should be rewarded for pushing equity and access to underserved neighborhoods. For example, in St. Louis, dockless bike companies will be allowed to expand past an initial 2,500 vehicle cap, but only if they present and implement a social equity plan and meet other ridership requirements. Some cities have already introduced such regulations. Santa Monica—which is not included in the NACTO report—was one of the first cities to regulate dockless scooters, and has taken a more proactive approach to find startups willing to be partners in finding mobility solutions. In San Francisco, the city has taken all scooters off the streets while it figures out a regulatory structure, a move some have criticized, but the city sees it in its best interests to control how tech companies make money off its public infrastructure. Make no mistake, transportation issues can be helped by technology—and these new dockless options hold great promise to solve issues. But tech alone can’t solve an issue, especially by barging into a space filled with existing rules, stakeholders, regulations, and community considerations. Policy, compliance, and human behavior will need to adjust, since technology can’t solve all of these problems. The various in-app prompts asking dockless scooter riders to wear helmets clearly isn’t working, but helmet laws have shown to deter riders from using certain modes altogether. Leaving scooters on sidewalks is a problem which could be fixed with better GPS technology, but the typical fidelity of existing systems—which can determine location within five to ten feet—isn’t precise enough to create and enforce geofenced parking areas. Most attempts at regulation so far have been met by strong pushback by transit technology companies. The NACTO report is a cry for common-sense regulations in the hope that collaboration, rather than cities ceding control or oversight, can truly increase transit options for all.",https://www.curbed.com/2018/7/11/17561598/dockless-scooters-bird-lime-street-sidewalk
The Scooting Life: Are Electric Scooters Worth the Trouble?,The New Yorker,,National,2018,7,11,"The Scooting Life: Are Electric Scooters Worth the Trouble? Let’s get one thing out of the way: battery-powered scooters, which, in recent months, have littered the sidewalks of American cities, are fantastically ugly. Though the tires are a little thicker, and there’s wiring and, usually, a digital speedometer, they’re modelled after the flimsy kick scooters often ridden by children. The companies that offer them have made few efforts to disguise this, and what efforts they have made are occasionally bizarre. Lime, which also offers a dockless bike-share service, paints its scooters in an eye-repelling lacquer of green and white. Skip slathers them in bright yellow and blue. Bird’s scooter force is the least offensive-looking: it employs a skinny black pole, emblazoned with a white stripe. Less bulky than Segways, the scooters entered the world to serve a function similar to that of Google Glass: a way of organizing one’s experience that nobody really asked for. Unlike that technology, however, the scooters appear to be popular among users, powering hundreds of thousands of rides in a select number of cities over a few months of use. A few writers have recently penned odes to the scooter: put off by their initial dorkiness, they grew to adore them over days of continuous use. They are popular among investors, too: Bird is now valued at two billion dollars; Lime and Skip are valued at a billion dollars and a hundred million dollars, respectively. For my part, I find their appeal mystifying. On a recent trip to Washington, D.C., I rode Lime and Skip scooters around Dupont and Logan Circles, and felt exposed and unsafe. I longed for a bicycle, which would have been faster and provided a bit of exercise. Someone derisively yelled “WHAT’S UP?” at me as I puttered on a lurid Lime scooter down a busy one-lane street, which may have colored the experience; then again, there was the moment when the scooter unexpectedly decreased in speed, from 9.7 miles per hour to 4.7, though the battery promised a couple miles more to go. Even at full speed, it was hard to imagine using it for anything but getting to a special lunch spot a little faster than usual, or for feeling like I was living life on a moving walkway. The “Why walk when you can scoot?” ethos comes, unsurprisingly, from Silicon Valley. Bird’s founder and C.E.O., Travis VanderZanden, was formerly an executive at Lyft and at Uber, Lime was created by former venture capitalists in the Bay Area, and two of Skip’s founders are Stanford alumni. In March, Lime, Bird, and another scooter startup called Spin began dumping hundreds of freestanding, smartphone-app-activated scooters in San Francisco, before a permitting process had been established. (A Lime spokesperson said that the company “launched weekend pop-ups in select parts of San Francisco with limited mobility options”; a spokesperson from Spin said that they confirmed with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency that “no permits were necessary at the time.”) Immediately, the city was flooded with complaints about nerds scooting on the sidewalk and leaving scooters in front of stores and offices. From mid-April to late May, the city’s 311 line received 1,873 scooter-related calls. By the time Bird got to Nashville, in May, it had dropped any pretense of interest in city approval. Shortly after a referendum to fund a new public-transit system failed overwhelmingly, the company made the scooters available for use the following weekend, and alerted Nashville via e-mail. The city was caught doubly shorthanded: by the failure of the referendum, and by Bird’s brazenness. Both San Francisco and Nashville have now removed scooters from the streets but are working with the scooter companies on a permitting process that would allow for their return. When I asked a spokesperson for the city of Nashville why Bird did it this way, she suggested that it followed ride-sharing companies’ “don’t ask for permission, ask for forgiveness” model. (“When we enter a new market, we do so in compliance with all the laws on the books,” a Bird spokesperson said. “Upon launch, we open a dialogue with a range of city officials and stakeholders.”) Are they good enough to forgive? Cities often suffer from what is known in transit parlance as the “first mile, last mile” problem—the distance between a commuter’s home or work and his nearest transit stop. In many low-density areas, the solution has been to drive to the nearest stop. In theory, scooters offer a lower-emission alternative—only nobody has proof that the scooters do take cars off the streets. In Washington, D.C., the District Department of Transportation (D.D.O.T.) has had a pilot program for seven dockless scooter and bike companies since last September. Each company is allowed to have four hundred vehicles on the street, and is required to share trip data with D.D.O.T. Though it did not share data with me, D.D.O.T. suggested that, anecdotally and preliminarily, the scooter rides appeared to be replacing not car trips but walking. When I attempted to find scooters in D.C., around 6 P.M. on a Tuesday, they were in short supply, and constantly disappearing as I neared their location: perhaps evidence of rush-hour demand, or of the unplanned nature of where users deposited them. Cycling between apps, my wife and I went scooter hunting from Dupont Circle to Logan Circle, a little under a mile away, where a scooter was supposedly parked outside of a Whole Foods. We found it secreted behind a turbine on the third floor of a parking garage: apparently, someone had stashed it there for later use. As my vehicle of the future groaned forward on a flat street, I saw my wife, who had agreed to walk the same distance, just half a block behind me. I looked down at my two feet, found an empty bike rack where I could ditch the scooter, and walked over to join her.",https://www.newyorker.com/culture/dept-of-design/the-scooting-life-are-electric-scooters-worth-the-trouble
New York Today: Are Electric Scooters Legal?,New York Times,,National,2018,7,19,"New York Today: Are Electric Scooters Legal? Good morning on this sparkling Thursday. The West Coast is abuzz with electric scooters — standing scooters, like a Razor, but with a motor — and we’ve started seeing them around New York City. So what’s the deal: Are they legal here? “They are illegal and I am not aware of anything in the works to change that,” Scott Gastel, a spokesman for the city’s Transportation Department, said in an email. Violators may receive a $500 civil penalty if they are caught riding them, and their scooters may be impounded. But many New Yorkers are seemingly not concerned about getting a citation. “They are not legal, but it’s not enforced,” said Sarah Kaufman, an assistant director at the N.Y.U. Rudin Center for Transportation, whose research there has focused on scooter share markets across American cities and around the world. “Anecdotally, everyone has seen a motorized scooter on a sidewalk.” Bird and Lime are among the electric scooter start-ups leading the craze in Los Angeles and San Francisco, “but in New York City, it’s still anyone’s market,” Ms. Kaufman said. The biggest obstacle here: There’s no place for scooters, physically. “They’re too fast for the sidewalk, they’re too slow for traffic, and they’re too slow for bike lanes, so there isn’t a safe space for them,” Ms. Kaufman said. (Most can go up to 15 miles per hour.) “The focus here is on dockless bikes and electric-assist bikes because those are the speeds of New York.” [Read about the new era of bike-share in our city.] Even so, exploring travel alternatives remains top-of-mind for some city residents. With the L train shutdown less than a year away, scooters could offer “a great advantage” to those affected, according to Ms. Kaufman, who led a Rudin Center report on ways to mitigate commutes during the closure of the subway line. “We’re going to have hundreds of thousands of people needing to find new modes of transportation,” she said. “Because there will be overcrowding on other subway lines, we might as well provide a variety of modes like rideshare and bus-bridges and, of course, bike share. However, not every person can or is willing to ride a bike.” Scooters have a lower barrier to entry, she added. “You’re generally not scooting in traffic — you’re generally on the sidewalk — and it’s easier to learn to navigate a scooter, and you don’t necessarily need a helmet like you do with a bike,” she said, “so people see it as an easier mode. A faster mode than walking, but not as labor intensive or stressful as biking.” But do keep in mind: Electric scooters still don’t have the green light in New York City and you could be pulled over.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/nyregion/new-york-today-are-electric-scooters-legal.html
"The life of an electric scooter: Nasty, brutish and often short",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,7,27,"The life of an electric scooter: Nasty, brutish and often short. Once an electric scooter has been released into the urban wild, its life might best be likened to that of a medieval serf — backbreaking labor followed by the strong possibility of an ignominious end. Scooters that reach their expiration date after being worn down merely by inclement weather, overuse and hazardous potholes are the lucky ones. Many others can expect their final moments to be undeniably barbaric. Some face death by bonfire, and others are flung into the ocean or tossed from the top of parking garages and bridges, shattering on concrete sidewalks or disappearing into murky waters below. Scooters have also been intentionally run over by trucks or torn apart — limb by electronic limb — by angry drunks and rage-filled teenagers screaming abusive epithets. At one point, a San Francisco repair shop was inundated with as many as 100 scooters a day, forcing owner Michael Ghadieh to hire three new mechanics. “The angry people, they were angry,” Ghadieh told CNET. “People cut cables, flatten tires, they were thrown in the bay. Someone was out there physically damaging these things.” Ghadieh said scooter vandalism has slowed in San Francisco, but it appears to be continuing as scooter companies parachute into cities across the country ahead of regulations, often taking the public and local officials by surprise. Euwyn Poon, co-founder of the scooter company Spin, infuriated critics in a recent on-camera interview with Vice when he described this strategy as “innovating on the regulatory side."" For the past month or so, all manner of scooter executions have been catalogued by “Birdgraveyard,” an Instagram account whose 14,000 followers relish — in mob-like fashion — the destruction of the battery-powered contraptions. Posts regularly generate hundreds of likes and more than 10,000 views. Scooter haters claim their destruction is a form of righteous rebellion. The scooters are not “last mile” transportation solutions, they argue, so much as the greedy tentacles of Silicon Valley brands wrapping themselves around public sidewalks. Others consider the scooters symbols of a troubling shift from public to “private” transportation, a change that places important decisions about how cities operate in the hands of multibillion-dollar companies thousands of miles away. For still others, destroying scooters offers a nihilistic release. “Smashing scooters is just funny,” the account administrators of Birdgraveyard told Vice. “It’s amusing when people come to the page and do not get why it’s funny. If you can’t laugh at a ride-share scooter being lit on fire at a house party, that’s a problem with you. There’s nothing in the Constitution that says we all have to respect and love brands.” Not surprisingly, scooter companies disagree. Although companies declined to release data about the average life span of their products — which differs depending on terrain, market and usage — they say they do applaud when people report vandalism of their products and when law enforcement investigates. “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” the scooter company Bird said in a statement. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior.” Lime, another scooter company, said its bikes and scooters are equipped with GPS mapping technology, making it easy to track their location if the company suspects a scooter has been stolen or vandalized. Lime noted that its products also contain sensors that are able to track when someone is trying to tamper with the device. “Lime does not tolerate vandalism of any kind,” the company said in a statement. “If anyone witnesses a potential incident of vandalism, we ask that they please immediately report it so our team can take the appropriate measures.” “Out of the 35,000+ scooters and bikes Lime has across the country, only a few have been vandalized, which is consistent with the low rate of vandalism and theft — less than 1 percent — we experience nationwide,” the statement added. Yet, scooter companies may not need their products to live a long life to make money off them. Spin told Reuters that the company “recoups the cost of a scooter in two to three weeks.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/27/life-an-electric-scooter-nasty-brutish-sometimes-short/
"Scooters: Sidewalk Nuisances, Or The Future Of Local Transportation?",NPR,NPR,National,2018,7,28,"Scooters: Sidewalk Nuisances, Or The Future Of Local Transportation? When Adam Stephens walked into his office in Milwaukee one morning in late June, he found messages complaining about the Birds. The deputy city attorney was not amused. He went for a walk. ""Within a couple of minutes, I found one parked on a sidewalk and was able to visually examine it and kind of figure out what it was,"" Stephens says. Bird is the name of an electric scooter company. Unannounced, it dropped off somewhere between 70 and 100 rental scooters throughout Milwaukee, where it's illegal to ride motorized scooters in public. Here's how it works: You download an app, put in your credit card information, and locate a scooter near you. It's about $1 to unlock them, and then 15 cents a minute. You can pretty much drop them off anywhere. And that's part of the problem: People have been leaving them all over city sidewalks. ""You have elderly people, you have people with disabilities, you have the visually impaired who rely on seeing eye dogs,"" Stephens says. In recent months, the hashtag #ScootersBehavingBadly has popped up, featuring scooters across the country parked in pedestrian walkways or riders speeding through while wearing headphones. Milwaukee issued a cease-and-desist order, but Bird refused. The case is now in federal court. Things have gone sour in several cities, like San Francisco and St. Paul, Minn., where scooter companies have been kicked out. But in some cities, they've flourished, like in Washington, D.C., where I took a scooter by the brand Spin out for a ride. It was fun, and a bit terrifying, to weave through rush-hour traffic. On the way, I met a fellow rider, Octavion Carter. He uses these to get around Howard University and gave me some advice: ""Watch the ground, because if you go over a crack or a pothole, you might fall. It happens to everybody."" There are about 1,200 electric scooters for rent in Washington. These companies have a few months to prove their worth. Luz Lazo, a transportation reporter at The Washington Post, says some people are annoyed by the trend. Still, she says, in a city where public transportation is notoriously unreliable, enough people are frustrated to give it a try. Lazo sees people of all backgrounds scooting around. ""Whether it's something that is going to last, or be a success, I mean we still have to wait and see,"" she says. Will the scooter, skateboard's goofy-looking cousin, be another fad, just like Segways or hoverboards? Big tech doesn't think so. Silicon Valley is betting on the future of micro-transportation. Uber recently invested in the scooter company Lime; and Lyft has announced it will soon be offering scooters on its app. As I ride back through D.C. on my rental, with the wind in my face, one thing becomes clear: It's fun, but there's no way I'm doing it in the winter.",https://www.npr.org/2018/07/28/631812255/scooters-sidewalk-nuisances-or-the-future-of-public-transportation
"Southern Californians are tossing electric scooters into ocean, burning them: report",Fox News,Fox,National,2018,8,13,"Southern Californians are tossing electric scooters into ocean, burning them: report. Residents in Southern California who feel they've had enough of the electric scooter craze are reportedly resorting to vandalism in an effort to vent their frustrations. They allege they cause numerous traffic accidents and scooter pilots tend to rush through the streets ignoring traffic signals. The Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday that workers at Santa Monica Beach and Venice have seen these pay-per-mile scooters tossed into the ocean and trash cans. One police officer in Venice said his officers have seen them stacked 10 feet high, but these cases are not being called in. “If we have to prioritize the allocation of our time and resources, first and foremost we’re going to prioritize the preservation of life,” Lt. Michael Soliman told the paper. “Protection of property comes second.” Cities like Milwaukee have initially pushed back on Bird and its competitors, LimeBike and Spin, by issuing cease-and-desist orders. But some have ultimately relented and decided to give the scooters a chance. Bird, a scooter rental company that operates in about 30 cities, previously removed them from Denver and Salt Lake City before resuming operations recently under a pilot program in those locations. Portland, Ore., is also allowing Bird scooters under a pilot. There is even an Instagram account called Birdgraveyard, which appears to celebrate the scooters’ destruction. It has over 28,000 followers. “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” a Bird spokeswoman told the paper. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior.” A Bird spokeswoman hopes those who see any vandalism report it. These electric scooters, which can go up to 15 mph, have proliferated in places across the country in recent months, often without warning to city officials who have grappled with how to regulate them. They could be found left in the middle of sidewalks, which could be an eyesore in a neighborhood. These companies point to their overall affordability and the fact they reduce car traffic. The Bird app shows where they're available. Riders, who must scan in their driver's license, unlock one by scanning a bar code for an initial charge of $1. It then costs 15 cents a minute to ride one. Once done, riders take a picture of where they left the scooter to make sure it's properly parked. Beverly Hills has reportedly banned scooters for six months. “If you imagine just walking on the sidewalk and somebody on a scooter at 15 miles an hour hits you, it can be fatal,” Beverly Hills councilmember Lili Bosse said last month after the California city voted to ban the devices for six months, following similar edicts and warnings in places like West Hollywood, Seattle, Saint Paul, Nashville, Boston and Miami.",https://www.foxnews.com/tech/southern-californians-are-tossing-electric-scooters-into-ocean-burning-them-report
Doctor: Do something about the dangers of e-scooters,CNN,,National,2018,8,16,"Doctor: Do something about the dangers of e-scooters. Electric scooter boards, zipping past with their often helmet-free riders balanced atop, are rolling into American cities -- like my hometown of Atlanta -- at breakneck speed. Really. You could break your neck on one. The venture-funded companies behind this new business model are pushing out their web-based scooter rental networks in dozens of cities and college campuses -- in the same guerrilla fashion as Uber delivered its newfangled taxis years ago, miraculously drawing money forth from the regulatory void. And largely getting away with it. Meanwhile, the accidents are piling up. I'm a doctor and this is a problem. It's a pattern regularly repeated with new consumer technology: sell it first, ask questions later. This is, of course, backwards. When health and safety is on the line, it is crucial that one company's legitimate right to come up with a handy new product (and money-making scheme) doesn't infringe on your right to move freely in public spaces without fear of serious injury. To wit: Consumer drones delivered similar problems. These remote-controlled flying blades will slice open human tissues on contact, yet despite that core safety failing, they exploded onto the marketplace without any rules. Accidents have abounded. An Iowa man recently incurred a paltry $160 fine after losing control of his drone, which proceeded to cut up a baby's face. And while the FAA now requires consumer drone registration, only commercial pilots are required to get licensed. Most importantly to people injured by drones, you don't have to get insurance if you want to fly one. Which brings us back to the electric scooters. Bird, the Los Angeles-based company that leads the market on e-scooters (its biggest competitors include Spin and Lime, both San-Francisco based), makes it clear you're on your own if you kiss the pavement (or an oncoming SUV) while riding Bird's tiny, flat black strip of metal suspended between two rubber tires. By renting a Bird, you're agreeing to ""fully release, indemnify, and hold harmless"" the company for injury, death, property damage and other losses. And as a Los Angeles woman who fractured her arm in two places recently learned after a Bird accident, neither your medical insurance nor car insurance may cover your medical bills; in her case, she told LA Times columnist Robin Abcarian, each insurer said the other should pay. Bird's rental agreement explicitly warns riders your automotive insurance may not cover your Bird accident. Doctors report seeing more people with injuries from electric scooters showing up in their ERs. While most come in with broken bones and road rash, some are deadly serious. Bird requires riders to be 18 or older, to wear a helmet, have a driver's license, stay off the sidewalk, and refrain from double riding. Many ignore this, with predictable outcomes. I recently treated such a rider at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, where we focus on neurotraumas, like spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). My patient, who wasn't wearing a helmet, suffered a severe TBI in a collision with a car. While the driver of the car may well be to blame too, drivers are at a disadvantage when such devices take to city streets without any preparation: no effort to educate car owners that there is a new motorized vehicle to watch out for, no signage, no special street markings, and no coordination with the city. A human figure standing up on an e-scooter represents a smaller visual profile than a bicyclist, and -- out of the driver's peripheral vision -- may ""read"" as an upright individual walking or running, as in ""I've got time to make this turn."" It's easy to see how visual perceptual problems, key to traffic safety, can contribute to these accidents. I think my patient will ultimately be OK, but the injury will interrupt this patient's life for months, along with that of their entire family. It'll be a tough process getting back to independent living and work. Electric scooter companies aren't just allowing their renters to take their own lives into their hands; by introducing the gadgets to unprepared cities (other places you can find them include Memphis, San Francisco, Denver and Austin, among others) they're putting nonriders at risk, too. Likely sensing their vulnerability on the roadways, some scooter riders are zipping along the sidewalks at 15 mph, where they risk knocking down pedestrians and baby carriages. Bird tells its riders to follow the law in whatever town they're in. The problem is, riders don't always follow the traffic laws, and Bird knows that; all of us know that. What's more, company business models actually expect users to discard their spent scooters along sidewalks and roadsides, where gig economy workers collect them overnight for recharging. In the meantime, their mere presence in public rights of way is already affecting some citizens like James Curtis, a longtime volunteer at my hospital who says the scooters block the sidewalk for his wheelchair, making him ""feel like a second-class citizen."" Should cities ban them? Miami did, after, as the Washington Post reported, ""their companies (were) sent packing by city attorneys with cease-and-desist letters in hand."" Nashville seized the scooters once they blocked public rights of way and caused accidents soon after the uninvited rollout. How and whether to issue an ordinance regulating the scooters remains a matter of hot debate. San Diego started giving out tickets to riders not wearing a helmet, and San Francisco also put on the brakes, impounding the scooters and issuing a cease-and-desist order after Bird, Lime and Spin launched their services in the city without asking. Now transportation officials there are weighing permit applications from a dozen additional scooter services. There are alternatives here to the chaotic rollout of the scooter business -- although they may upend the companies' ""disruptive"" business models. Deep-pocketed e-scooter ventures should partner with cities to create scooter-enabled zones, with properly marked roadways and warning signage. They should learn their lessons there, and expand these zones as the safety track record warrants. The fact is, this technology absolutely could bring potential benefits to gridlocked cities like Atlanta, with the scooters' environmentally-friendly energy consumption, tiny physical footprint, and convenience. But these benefits have to be weighed alongside the interests of other citizens using the public byways. Instead, early this year Bird supported a bill in California aimed at ditching helmet laws, upping speeds to 20 mph and legally permitting scooters on sidewalks (something users are doing anyway, without the law on their side). A significantly revised version of the bill dumped most of the company's requests but still makes it legal to ride scooters without a helmet. The bill got through the state assembly and is up for a vote in the Senate. I'm not holding my breath that e-scooter companies will step up to their responsibility: it's America and there's too much money to be made. What will control this e-scooter proliferation is waves of personal injury lawsuits (firms are already gearing up) that will regulate to some extent where dysfunctional city and state government have failed to do so. Meanwhile, I have a premonition I'll be writing something similar to this piece in 10 to 15 years, when rental jetpacks dumped on park benches start careening their customers into power lines and office towers. Could we try to get it right first, before that happens?

"Electric scooters’ sudden invasion of American cities, explained",Vox,Vox,National,2018,8,27,"Electric scooters’ sudden invasion of American cities, explained. Turns out there’s a lot of latent demand for a quick and cheap way to get around. Hundreds of motorized electric scooters quietly descended upon San Francisco seemingly overnight in March. And then one day in June, they were gone. In the months before their rapture, the scooters puzzled, infatuated, and infuriated residents. Those who dared to try them discovered a whimsical and cheap way to get around. Non-riders saw a swarm of locusts devouring precious inches of sidewalk and street, backed by companies that were the epitome of tech-bro arrogance. The city panicked, ordering that all scooters be removed. In late August, San Francisco announced that it will give just two companies, Scoot and Skip, permits to test 625 scooters each in the city for one year. And it has become a microcosm of the promise and perils of the scooter stampede. Already, scooter companies operate in 65 cities and are vying for the top prize, New York City. Some city officials, however, are desperately trying to rein in and regulate scooters, which often appear without warning and without local input. Without docks, scooters are cluttering sidewalks and blocking wheelchair ramps. Riders weaving through crowds or ignoring traffic rules have caused bruises and broken bones. In Santa Monica, California, it’s apparently hard to walk without tripping over a scooter: The companies behind the scooters haven’t done themselves any favors either. Following in the tracks of aggressive ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, some scooter companies have adopted the notorious “ask forgiveness rather than permission” approach when setting up shop. As in San Francisco, officials in cities like St. Louis were surprised to see hundreds of scooters suddenly perched on curbs without any forewarning. Other cities, like Seattle, are trying to keep them out until they can write rules of the road to manage them. And this being 2018, scooter companies have attempted to seed a social media backlash to the backlash. Amid the feverish passion for and against scooters, there’s a larger reckoning taking place about rapid changes to our cities and public spaces. The scooters are forcing conversations about who is entitled to use sidewalks, streets, and curbs, and who should pay for their upkeep. They’re also exposing transit deserts, showing who is and isn’t adequately served by the status quo, and even by newer options like bike share. That people have taken so readily to scooters shows just how much latent demand there is for a quick and cheap way to get around cities. Electric scooters are also challenging the king of American transit, the car. Most car trips are short, and if electric scooters do end up replacing some of them, they could alleviate congestion and help the environment. But that’s a big “if.” So whether scooters are already rolling into your city or an infestation is looming, you might be wondering how they work, how they get charged, whether they’re safe, and if they are, in fact, good. Here are some answers. Grab the handlebars and hop on. What are scooters, and where did they come from? The electric scooters we’re talking about here are pretty simple. Imagine an ordinary two-wheeled kick scooter, like a Razor. Now imagine that it has an electric motor. That’s pretty much it. The key innovation with the latest batch of scooters is the rental business model: Download the app on your smartphone for a scooter company — Bird, Lime, Skip, Scoot, or Spin — and use the map to find a nearby scooter. Enter a credit card and scan a barcode to unlock the scooter. Go for a ride. Park the scooter and end the ride on the app. The design of the electric scooter itself has been around for years, but it was often marketed as a toy. You may also recall another grown-up, two-wheeled “personal transporter”: Launched in 2002, the Segway rode a wave of hope and hype into the market, promising to revolutionize transportation. The device used gyroscopes to almost magically balance on two wheels, sipped electricity, steered intuitively with body movements, and whisked riders along silently at 12 miles per hour. But it launched with a price of $4,950, making it more a luxury bauble than a commuting workhorse. It was too heavy to carry easily when the batteries ran low. It was too fast for sidewalks, too slow and vulnerable for roads. Riders towered awkwardly over pedestrians, standing stiffly with their feet together as they whirred along. It soon became associated with tech bros and elitism, and thereafter was a punchline. Segways are still around, but the riders are tour groups, mall security, and parking enforcement. They never became cool. As Jordan Golson wrote at Wired, “the problems that sank the Segway weren’t technological. They were social.” So it’s these problems of Segways, plus the cost, that scooter rental companies are trying to solve. For one thing, the rental scooters insulate the rider from most of the cost of the device. At retail, they cost between $100 and $500. But you can start riding many electric scooters for $1 and then 15 cents a minute thereafter. A 2-mile ride takes about 10 minutes and costs less than $3. When you’re done, you don’t have to take it inside or even plug it in; just leave it in a public space where it doesn’t block traffic. This business model has drastically lowered the barrier to entry for scooter riders, allowing scooter skeptics to cheaply satiate their curiosity, turning some into loyal riders. Though the hardware is more akin to a Segway, the software makes using an electric scooter just like using a dockless bike. Most of the scooter companies are using rebadged versions of existing electric scooter models that are already for sale. But they want their own custom devices that can handle the rigors of rental. In May, Lime announced it was partnering with Segway to design its next-generation scooter. Bird also rents out Segway-designed scooters. The proliferation of rental scooters also draws on advances in telecommunications. The scooters have GPS units and 4G data connections to track riders’ every move. And the riders all have smartphones that locate and unlock the scooters while automatically paying the fare. Batteries are another key advance. Since the early 2000s, energy storage systems have become more powerful and less expensive. Vehicle battery prices have dropped 86 percent between 2010 and 2016. Electric scooters now travel 20 to 30 miles between charges. These batteries have also benefited other electric transportation devices like motorized skateboards and unicycles. Investors right now are also hungry for transportation startups, which partly explains the scooter boom. From ride-hailing to self-driving cars to electric cars, billions of dollars are pouring into companies that move people around. But short trips between apartments and metro stops or leisurely rides across parks remained a vacuum until recently. So dockless bikes and, later, electric scooters rushed in to fill the void, securing millions if not billions in financing while clawing for market share. On the customer side, there is a cadre of riders primed to adopt electric scooters. The generation that grew up rolling around culs-de-sac on Razor scooters is now commuting in urban centers. Balancing on two wheels is already familiar to them, so an app-enabled scooter rental service that can get you to work without breaking a sweat is an appealing throwback and a flash-forward. In sum, the combination of entrepreneurs, technology, funding, and a race to grab a toehold in major urban centers all converged earlier this year, leading to a sudden crop of scooters starting on the West Coast in March and rippling throughout the country. Here in Washington, DC, where four scooter companies have launched, I’ve found that the scooter has many charms. A scooter can whisk me to work past stopped traffic at 15 miles per hour. It’s very convenient to park it just about anywhere. Some scooter firms are already “unicorns” — privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion. Bird, based in Santa Monica, doubled its valuation to $2 billion in just four months. Lime, which also rents bikes, crossed the $1.1 billion valuation mark just 18 months after it launched. Skip Scooters is valued at $100 million. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft are themselves getting into the electric scooter game. In early September, Lyft launched 250 scooters in Denver. Uber bought Jump Bikes, an electric bike rental service, for $200 million in April. But could there be a crash on the horizon? We’re already seeing dockless bikes piling up in scrap yards as companies fold. In China, abandoned bike-share bikes now fill vast fields outside major cities. As scooter-share companies jostle for dominance, weaker players will inevitably fold or be acquired, but it’s too early to say whether the concept as a whole will have staying power. Who charges scooters, and how much are they paid? Behind every scooter parked on a sidewalk, leaning on a kickstand, is a vast, invisible infrastructure network that keeps the scooters maintained, charged, and accessible. Engineers track where the scooters are going. Support staff answer questions on the phone. Technicians whisk off damaged scooters to hidden warehouses for repair. And as the sun sets and power meters run low, chargers for hire roam the streets, scavenging depleted scooters, plugging them in at home, and placing them back on sidewalks early the next morning. Bird scooters return to their “nest.” Lime scooters are charged by “juicers.” “For many people, it’s a fun way to make extra money,” said Colin McMahon, who leads Lime’s juicer program. The way it works: Potential juicers apply for the job with Lime. When approved, they get special access through the app that highlights scooters that need charging. Charging one nets a juicer between $9 and $12, depending on how low the battery is, so a juicer’s take is a function of how many scooters she picks up and how much power those scooters need. Charging the scooter requires about half a kilowatt-hour of electricity, about 5 cents’ worth of power on average. McMahon said most juicers spend an hour or two in the evening walking or driving around making pickups and then redeploy the scooters in specific locations marked on the app. “We leverage our data to say where are the best spots for people to begin their day for commuting,” he said. He declined to share the number of juicers Lime has on its roster or the typical number of scooters charged per juicer. Bird follows a similar model. A diverse array of people have signed up as Lime juicers and Bird hunters, but unlike driving for Uber or Lyft, there is no background check. Technically, you have to be over 18, but many high schoolers are getting into the charging game, as the Atlantic reported. The sliding scale for charging scooters has also created some perverse incentives that ne’er-do-wells have already exploited, as Nathaniel Buckley wrote at Slate: ... it turns out the charging system is akin to a real-life Pokémon Go, albeit one rife with cheating. The app purports to tell you where nearby chargeable scooters are, but in reality that’s rarely the case. Duplicitous collectors have created a thriving ecosystem of stockpiling, hiding, and decoying that makes it well-nigh impossible to find a scooter in need of charging. When picking up a scooter, chargers are supposed to “capture” it via a button on the app. Doing this deletes the flag so others don’t waste time scouting for that particular Bird. It also stops the clock on the reimbursement meter. The longer a scooter goes without being captured, the greater the commission Bird will pay its chargers. According to Harry Campbell of the Rideshare Guy Blog, scooter bounty hunters can net $20 to $30 an hour. And since each scooter can only be claimed by one charger, it can get competitive, as Taylor Lorenz reported at the Atlantic: In saturated markets, the race to quickly grab as many scooters as possible is fierce. “One time I pulled up to pick up a scooter, I got there maybe 10 seconds before the other guy did,” said one charger in San Diego. “He started yelling at me. He picked up a Bird scooter and started beating my car. I got the hell out of there.” There are also repair crews who scoop up damaged or vandalized scooters, though scooter companies insist only a small fraction of their vehicles end up deliberately mangled. Are electric scooters safe? Do I need a helmet? “Speed has never killed anyone,” said former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. “Suddenly becoming stationary, that’s what gets you.” This holds for scooters. Traveling at up to 15 miles per hour doesn’t seem like much until you rapidly become acquainted with an unmoving object — say, a street sign, a wall, or the ground. Scooters don’t have crumple zones, air bags, or padding, so riders are exposed to everything around them. There has been a rise in scooter-related injuries, but that’s largely a function of the spread of scooters themselves rather than any inherent danger in the vehicle. Still, given the vast abundance of these scooters, some physicians are concerned. Law firms are also readying themselves for litigation. “We’re seeing these injuries daily, and at least once or twice a week we’re seeing someone who needs an urgent surgery,” Natasha Trentacosta, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles studying electric scooter-related injuries, told the Cedars-Sinai Blog. “These can be life-changing injuries, and they can often be prevented.” Right now there isn’t any good data on injury rates among scooter riders. Many of the bumps and scrapes that come from a scooter tumble are minor, and there is no good way to track them. Health officials in California are trying to change that with a standardized data collection system. There are plenty of threats to scooter riders for researchers to track. The tiny wheels can get trapped by uneven sidewalks and grates, causing falls. Damp weather can easily weaken the tires’ grip. On busy sidewalks, riders have to maneuver around pedestrians, pets, and potholes. On the road, scooters can be hard for drivers to see, and heavy, fast-moving vehicles can be deadly. There’s also a learning curve. Electric motors can accelerate surprisingly quickly, and the momentum a rider generates takes effort to slow down. Keeping a leg ready to brace for a sudden stop requires some practice. However, many of the same precautions for cyclists can reduce risks on scooters: Be aware of your surroundings, make sure the equipment is in good order, follow traffic rules, take your earbuds out, put away your phone, and be judicious with your speed. As for helmets, scooter companies encourage riders to wear them with reminders in their respective apps (it’s also required by law in some states), though almost no one does. Bird currently offers free helmets to active riders (just pay shipping) but is also lobbying to relax helmet laws in California. In practical terms, though, many riders won’t be carrying a helmet around for scootering since it’s a transportation mode designed for whim and convenience. And the biggest safety issues right now stem from inexperience. Given how new scooters are, there’s no consistent etiquette for riding an electric scooter, and so pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists can’t necessarily anticipate what a scooter will do in an intersection, which can lead to conflicts (read: collisions). Some riders claim the sidewalk; others ride in the street. Some will follow pedestrian signals, some will obey traffic lights, and some will do none of the above. Scooters don’t have turn signals, so it’s hard to broadcast your intent as a rider. They do have bells, but they don’t help much to get the attention of car drivers. Establishing a set of best practices (and actually following them) would go a long way toward smoothing out the tensions between different modes of transport and solving the safety issues around scooters. This would require regulation from cities and education from scooter companies. And as with any vehicle, don’t ride a scooter under the influence; it’s dangerous and illegal. What’s the best place to ride a scooter: sidewalk, bike lane, or street? Most city ordinances say (and scooter rental companies insist) that electric scooters shouldn’t be ridden on sidewalks. Motorized vehicles pose a nuisance, if not a hazard, to pedestrians. So that pretty much leaves streets. And for the reasons mentioned above, it can be nerve-racking for riders as cars whizz by. Which means scooters often remain on sidewalks, against the terms of service and, in many cases, the law. The best and likely safest place for a scooter is a bike lane since there are no pedestrians and because the lanes can accommodate faster traffic (as a daily bike commuter, scooters aren’t any more annoying than slower cyclists). However, most streets don’t have bike lanes, and unless the bike lane is protected or separated from car traffic, scooter riders will still have to contend with cars weaving in and out. Bike lanes also don’t reach most destinations, which means a scooter ride will almost always require riding on the sidewalk or in open traffic at some point. Are electric scooters good for the environment? And will they reduce car traffic? The answer is an unsatisfactory “it depends.” Like electric cars, scooters are only as green as the electricity that charges them. If your city gets most of its power from a coal or natural gas-fired power plant, that means your scoot around the neighborhood has a positive carbon footprint. But the other piece of the environmental equation is what the scooter ride is displacing, or if it leads to trips that otherwise wouldn’t be taken. For example, Estonia launched the largest free public transit system in the world in July. In the capital, Tallinn, researchers found that the scheme didn’t reduce car travel but did decrease walking. If you’re scooting instead of walking, then the ride has a higher environmental cost. But if you’re replacing a car ride, then it has an environmental benefit since an electric scooter uses a tiny fraction of the energy consumed by a car. Right now, scooters are doing both. “Some of those walk trips are likely to be taken away at the shorter end, and some of those car trips are those at the long end,” said Brian Taylor, a professor of urban planning at the University of California Los Angeles who studies how transportation serves different population sets. How does the environmental impact of scooters stack up next to public transit? Well, it also depends. The balance changes depending on how far you’re going and the form of transit it’s replacing, whether it’s a diesel bus or an electric train. On the other hand, a scooter can also encourage the use of public transportation. Most scooter trips are 1 to 2 miles long, and the companies themselves pitch scooters as filling the “last mile” in transit, expanding the reach of a transit station or a bus stop. “There’s the West LA rail station that’s a 22-minute walk from me,” Taylor said. “I took a scooter the other day and it took me five minutes.” If a scooter can help avoid commuting by car altogether, then the net environmental benefits can be huge. And even added all together, the energy use of scooters is trivial compared to the ongoing energy use in cars, buses, trains. Keep in mind that the vast majority of trips people take on a regular basis are short. According to the US Department of Energy, almost 60 percent of vehicle trips in 2017 were less than 6 miles: Cars in particular comprise a huge chunk of these short trips. “Today, 40 percent of car trips are less than two miles long,” said Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden in a statement in March. “Our goal is to replace as many of those trips as possible so we can to get cars off the road and curb traffic and greenhouse gas emissions.” According to the Environmental Protection Agency, if drivers decided to walk or bike instead of drive for half of all car trips shorter than a mile, drivers would avert 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year and save $900 million annually. Scooter rides are typically less than 2 miles, which is often too short a distance for hailing a ride if you don’t already own a car. This is part of why ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft are so keen on electric scooters: They fill a need their current services can’t. So scooter rides are going to displace car trips to an extent, which may reduce the number of cars on the road. However, urban journeys are becoming increasingly multimodal, and scooters may add one more flexible link to the transit chain rather than replacing another mode completely. Their most valuable traits are how flexible they are compared to public transit, which runs fixed routes, and how cheap they are compared to cars. That means scooters fulfill a unique niche of the transportation ecosystem. And if more scooters are riding in the streets, that could slow down traffic and increase congestion. Are electric scooters good for cities? In a word, yes. A qualified yes. Despite the consternation about how they’ve been rolled out, public opinion is on their side. According to a July survey by Populus of 7,000 people in a report titled “The Micro-Mobility Revolution,” 70 percent of respondents on average had a positive view of scooters, though perceptions varied by city: The differences in attitude across cities in part come from the fact that scooter companies and their riders haven’t always been the best citizens. Many cities were eager to deploy docked bike-share bikes because it gave them control over where the bikes end up. But dockless bikes, and now scooters, have made it much more difficult to wrangle wheels. Scooters and bikes blocked sidewalks, disability access ramps, and green spaces. For some of the launch cities, they quickly became a nuisance. For people with disabilities or limited mobility, the scooters became a hazard. For this reason, some urban planners say scooters must be regulated. But cities that saw a more gradual rollout have had a much smoother ride. “In San Francisco, you saw a lot of backlash,” said Sanjay Dastoor, CEO of Skip, of the sudden, unannounced scooter deployment in the city. “We didn’t see DC in the news with a scooter armageddon. The backlash depends on the way you do it.” Dastoor noted that Skip is proactively working with cities before deploying in a market and has never been issued a cease-and-desist order. The company is also trying to encourage riders to be more considerate through its app, informing them of the rules before they ride. However, he acknowledged it’s still a challenge to keep miscreants in check. “In terms of enforcing behavior, that’s tough to do,” he said. Companies are also working to ensure their devices stay out of the way. Scooter companies now ask riders for a photo to verify that the scooter is parked in an appropriate spot at the end of a ride. The upshot of all this hassle is that scooters are bringing cheap transportation to people who may otherwise not have used it. They effectively expand the range of neighborhoods, allowing residents to easily travel further and increasing the reach of businesses. Researchers have found that mobility is a critical rung in the ladder out of poverty. That may explain why electric scooters have a better reputation with people of lower incomes, according to Populus: Bird has already proposed offering discounts for people who live in public housing or receive food stamps. Lime introduced a donation module to its app that will allow riders to dedicate part of their fare to a local nonprofit. Cities are starting to pick up on this. In talking with city officials, Dastoor said one of the concerns that keeps cropping up is equality: Cities want to make sure scooters serve all neighborhoods and that people have equal access to them. Scooters could also work as a stopgap solution for transit deserts, but there are still people who can’t take advantage of them, like residents who can’t afford a smartphone to unlock one. For them, the benefit of scooters may just be that they expose gaps in transportation infrastructure. But while cities argue over what to do about electric scooters, there’s another dockless vehicle taking up public spaces that often gets left out of the discussion: It’s hard to overstate just how much cars have shaped cities, suburbs, and the country as a whole, becoming the water we all swim in. While cities are working to limit the number of scooters permitted, few have even thought about capping the number of cars. You even need a driver’s license to ride a scooter. As Populus observed in its report: Based on the most recent public data, San Francisco, a relatively small city with one of the lowest vehicle ownership rates in the country, has approximately 500,000 registered vehicles. The city has approximately 442,000 publicly-available parking spots, including 275,000 on-street parking spaces. In comparison, various e-scooter regulations across the country that have adopted fleet restrictions have set caps on the number of e-scooters at 150 (on the low end) to 3,000 per company (on the high end, or no cap at all). Though not everyone owns a car, everyone pays for one. There are roughly eight parking spots for every car in the United States, and free parking amounts to a subsidy to car owners of more than $100 billion a year. That’s all before you include the impacts of driving, where the car actually moves. Roadways, law enforcement, pollution, and lost lives all add up to a huge social cost from driving, one that completely dwarfs anything electric scooters can muster. And when a scooter company falls, it isn’t going to get a bailout from Congress. This means there’s a strong case for demanding concessions from car infrastructure to facilitate walking, biking, and scooter riding — transit options that are more equitable and easier to access. That is, narrower roads in favor of larger bike lanes and sidewalks, also called a road diet. And as Alissa Walker pointed out on our sister site Curbed, where there’s a will, there’s a way: Seville, Spain—a city almost identical in size to San Francisco—built out a comprehensive “lightning” bike-lane network in just 18 months. The number of people commuting by bike daily increased tenfold in about four years. How did it work? The city carved out space from existing roadways—and eliminated 5,000 places to park cars. But scooter companies need to have city officials on their side if they want to continue doing business. Even scofflaws like Lyft and Uber are wising up, submitting proposals to cities like Santa Monica before launching their own scooter businesses there. Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of scooters will be that they will force a larger discussion of whom or what we prioritize when we design cities. “I’m hoping that all of this disruption will help us think more systematically about these things,” said UCLA’s Taylor. The Big Apple is eager to have this conversation. City officials are already crafting legislation to help target scooters to areas suffering from transit congestion, like the L train corridor. Earlier this month, the New York Times editorial board endorsed the prospect of electric scooters roaming the streets. “If the city is serious about wanting safe, reliable ways for people in all areas of New York to get around, the path ahead is clear,” they wrote.",https://www.vox.com/2018/8/27/17676670/electric-scooter-rental-bird-lime-skip-spin-cities
Cities start giving scooter companies a second chance,CNN,,National,2018,8,29,"Cities start giving scooter companies a second chance. The backlash against electric scooters shows some sign of waning as US cities that cracked down on the startups begin thinking maybe they aren't so bad after all. Cities across the United States moved aggressively to rein in, and even shut down, companies like Bird and Lime when hundreds of scooters filled their streets and cluttered their sidewalks seemingly overnight earlier this year. Many impounded the scooters. Some levied fines. Yet some cities are softening their stance as they realize scooters can play an integral role in easing congestion, reducing pollution, and bolstering public transit. And the startups, having watched companies such as Uber be penalized for antagonizing municipal governments, are willing to play nicely if it means expanding their market. Austin, Texas, offers a case in point. The city found itself inundated with Bird's sleek black scooters in April. Lime flooded the city with its bright green scooters a short time later. ""The human response would be, shake off the gloves and let's go. Let's fight this. You just disrupted my city,"" Jason JonMichael, assistant director of Austin's smart mobility program, told CNNMoney. Instead, city officials talked things over. As it happened, they'd been planning a dockless bikesharing program. Their plan called for eventually adding scooters to the mix, so they decided to work with the companies to make it happen, JonMichael said. Rather than issue a cease and desist letter -- an approach some cities took -- Austin warned the companies that it would confiscate scooters blocking sidewalks. And city officials set to work crafting an ordinance governing a permitting process for scooter services, including speed restrictions and fees for operating. Today you'll find 2,000 scooters all over Austin. People love them so much -- each scooter is ridden nearly 20 times daily -- that their batteries often go dead by noon, JonMichael said. And it's making life better in the city, too. JonMichael said people are taking fewer solo trips in cars, which means less congestion and pollution. The city reviews each company's performance every six months, reserving the right to revoke the license of anyone who isn't playing by the rules. That's got the startups working hard to stay in the city's good graces by offering discounted rides to low-income residents and developing tools that allow people to report bad behavior by anyone zipping along on a scooter. City officials now see scooter and bikeshare firms as allies in their efforts to improve quality of life and expand transit options. The startups are ""bringing to the table discussions about developing a roadmap to deploy transportation that from the get-go has equity and access for all built into it,"" JonMicheal said. Bird hopes to broker a similar alliance in its hometown of Santa Monica, California. The company launched in September 2017 and followed the ridesharing playbook that says it's better to seek forgiveness than permission. Bird launched without proper business licenses, and in February agreed to pay the city $300,000 in fines to settle a criminal complaint. Despite the trouble, Santa Monica officials wanted electric scooters to stay given their focus on multi-modal transportation and carbon-light living. The city gave Bird and Lime conditional permits while it worked to set up a 16-month pilot program. Earlier this month, the Santa Monica government ranked applicants to its scooter program, and Bird placed 10th. ""That was a real wake-up call. This is a fantastic business, and there's a lot of competitors who want to do it,"" Dave Estrada, the Chief Legal Officer at Bird told CNNMoney. ""It really helped us take a good look at how we were doing operations and how we can best serve cities."" That explains why Bird on Wednesday announced several concessions intended to curry favor with Santa Monica and other cities. It will let cities designate no-go areas where people can't ride or park scooters. It will grant cities the option to convey the rules of the road and other safety tips in messages users see before riding off. And it will share data that will help cities understand how people are using its scooters. Bird went so far as to resubmit its Santa Monica application earlier this month, to be more appealing to the government. At the city's request, it has begun limiting the speed of its scooters to 5 mph on the beach path, and in Palisades Park, two areas that have been controversial. It also plans to send text alerts to riders who stray into areas where cities don't want scooters. A lingering challenge for the industry is sidewalk riding, which irritates many pedestrians. The scooter companies instruct customers to ride in bike lanes, but bike lanes are rare and sometimes customers still choose sidewalks. Bird is exploring ways to discourage sidewalk riding, by automatically detecting with sensors when a scooter is on a sidewalk. It may not be popular with every rider, but the startup has realized that cities are its customers too. ""We started understanding that we had one customer, the rider,"" Estrada said. ""Now we really understand a lot better that customers include cities and people who don't ride Birds.""",https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/29/technology/scooters-cities-bird-santa-monica/index.html
Dockless Scooters Gain Popularity And Scorn Across The U.S.,NPR,NPR,National,2018,8,29,"Dockless Scooters Gain Popularity And Scorn Across The U.S. Over the past year, dockless electric scooters have descended on city sidewalks almost as if they fell from the sky. From Austin, Texas, to Denver to Cambridge, Mass., these compact two-wheelers are leading what researchers are calling the ""micro-mobility revolution."" But their arrival has not been without controversy. A survey of 7,000 people by the research firm Populous found that 3.6 percent of people reported using scooters in the relatively short time they've been available, which is a quicker adoption rate than competitors such as dockless bikes. Nearly 70 percent of people view dockless scooters positively, the report also found. ""The adoption of these new services has been quite remarkable in terms of how quickly people have started using them, and in fact, overall adoption of new mobility services is accelerating,"" Populous CEO Regina Clewlow tells Here & Now's Peter O'Dowd. Many of those surveyed view dockless scooters as a fun and easy way to get around the city, Clewlow says. According to the report, riders say dockless scooters complement public transportation and can replace short rides in a personal car, Uber or Lyft. They can also support a car-free lifestyle. And they're cheap to ride, too. They cost about $1 to unlock and then 15 cents per minute. Users download an app, enter their credit card information and locate available scooters in their area. ""Because so many people are accustomed to using their cellphones to call an Uber or Lyft or now unlock a car-sharing vehicle, the idea of being able to unlock a dockless electric scooter feels quite natural,"" Clewlow says. But those who enjoy riding these scooters may constitute a silent majority. In fact, dockless scooters and bikes have drawn the ire of some residents who say they're a nuisance. People weave in and out of traffic at speeds of up to 15 mph, often without helmets, and when they're done riding, they discard the scooters in the middle of sidewalks, according to reports. Paul Christian, an Uber driver in Austin, told Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson that he often has to dodge reckless riders. ""They're kind of cool, I guess,"" he says of the scooters. ""But at the same time, I see a lot of people doing some unsafe driving habits when they're on those scooters like going the wrong way on one-way streets, running through stop signs, red lights, and I'm just kind of worried that someone might have an accident."" The scooters have made people so angry that some have taken matters into their own hands. In Los Angeles, scooters have been vandalized, set on fire and tossed into public toilets. The Instagram account ScootersBehavingBadly documents the all-out war against dockless scooters in some cities. Local governments are also struggling to keep up. In San Francisco, St. Louis and Milwaukee, among other cities, electric scooter companies deployed hundreds of scooters unannounced or without permission from the city. Some cities have completely banned scooters by issuing cease-and-desist orders. In June, San Francisco ordered electric scooter companies to stop operations until they applied for permits. The same thing happened in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass., just days after scooters were dropped on the streets. Patrick Sisson, a reporter with the website Curbed, told NPR's All Things Considered that the confusion over how to regulate dockless scooters is similar to how local governments reacted to the rise of Uber's and Lyft's ride-sharing services. City officials are completely caught off guard and unprepared. ""It sort of follows the same blueprint we saw with Uber and Lyft, where tech companies are looking to provide transportation mobility solutions,"" Sisson says. ""But they're asking for forgiveness after the fact instead of permission before the fact."" But Clewlow says dockless vehicles will be easier to regulate because they are smaller than cars and ""you can impound them and collect them much more easily."" In response to the backlash, the scooter rental service Bird released a set of tools to help cities deal with the influx of scooters, which includes a tracking system that studies how people are using the scooters. ""The cities we serve are Bird's number-one customer, and partnering with them to deliver the data, insights, and products they need to advance their mobility programs and reduce congestion in their communities is essential,"" said Travis VanderZanden, CEO and founder of Bird, in a statement. Despite the backlash, some electric scooter companies have gained incredible value in a short time. Bird doubled its value to $2 billion in just four months, and Lime was worth more than $1.1 billion about a year and a half after it launched. Investors are also playing catch-up. In July, Uber announced a partnership with Lime to add scooters to its app. Lyft recently acquired Motivate, the largest bike-sharing company in the U.S. ""I believe a lot of people were caught off guard,"" Clewlow says. ""So not just cities, but I think that there are actually plenty of people within the private sector, in the investor community, who missed the scooter wave in terms of investment.""",https://www.npr.org/2018/08/29/643058414/dockless-scooters-gain-popularity-and-scorn-across-the-u-s
"Scooters will return to San Francisco, but Bird and Lime aren’t invited",The Verge,Vox,National,2018,8,30,"Scooters will return to San Francisco, but Bird and Lime aren’t invited. Skip and Scoot, two underdogs in the scooter war, won the coveted permits. After more than two months of waiting, San Francisco has announced that only two scooter companies are allowed to return to the city: Scoot and Skip. The news comes as a rebuke to hometown ride-hail companies Uber and Lyft, which are both expanding beyond cars in an effort to become one-stop mobility shops. It’s also a snub to startups Bird and Lime, which are the two largest shared-scooter operators in the world; each is valued at over $1 billion. Skip and Scoot are much smaller companies, but they will no doubt see a boost after winning permits for San Francisco. According to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), both companies will be allowed to operate a maximum of 625 scooters each for six months starting in October. After that, Scoot and Skip may be allowed to increase that number to 2,500 scooters each. While no application was flawless, the SFMTA selected only the applicants with the strongest proposals for the one-year pilot program. Scoot and Skip put forth the strongest applications the SFMTA received. Taken as a whole, Scoot and Skip’s applications demonstrated not only a commitment to meet the terms of the permit, but a high level of capability to operate a safe, equitable and accountable scooter share service. In the end, the original decision by Bird and Lime (as well as startup Spin) to drop their scooters onto the city’s streets without permission may have ultimately done them in. The city notes that from April 11th to May 23rd, San Francisco’s 311 Customer Service Center received nearly 1,900 complaints regarding scooters. “Complaints ranged from scooters blocking sidewalk access to unsafe riding in the public right-of-way,” SFMTA says. “San Francisco Public Works had to impound more than 500 scooters that were blocking sidewalks or otherwise improperly parked.” Further south in California, the city of Santa Monica also announced four permits for bikes and scooters: Bird, Lime, Lyft, and the Uber-owned Jump. The selection of Bird and Lime came as a bit of a surprise after the two companies scored poorly during the planning process. The four winning companies will be allowed to operate 750 devices each, totaling 1,000 e-bikes and 2,000 scooters. Bird and Lime have chosen to operate scooters only, while Jump and Lyft will split their total between bikes and scooters. The announcements were hotly anticipated as cities across the country begin to write new rules to rein in the dockless scooter frenzy that has gripped much of America for the better part of the year. The scooters first arrived unannounced earlier this year in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica. Since then, they’ve spread to scores of cities across the US, and have started appearing in Europe and the Middle East as well. But rather than let them spread uninhibited, cities moved to crack down on the scooters by issuing cease and desist letters or simply ordering them off the streets until new regulations could be written. Meanwhile, the hate and scorn has mostly died away, and many now realize that the scooters are an excellent avatar to discuss things like protected bike lanes, mobility, and livable streets. The scooters may never shake their reputation as the product of Silicon Valley’s tech-bro “move fast and break things” culture, but they’ve helped kick off a wider discussion about the need to get people out of cars and into more sustainable modes of transportation.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/30/17800960/scooters-sf-permits-bird-lime-uber-lyft-scoot-skip
How Electric Scooters Are Reshaping Cities,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,9,7,"How Electric Scooters Are Reshaping Cities. One of the biggest stories in technology this year is the exploding popularity of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin and Scoot. They’re all electric scooter-rental services, and their vehicles are suddenly buzzing along city streets and sidewalks around the world. These startups allow riders to locate and unlock scooters with an app. When they reach their destination, they just walk away. Some drivers and pedestrians see the scooters as dangerous contrivances that must be stopped, while some urban planners consider them, along with bikes, the future of city transport. 1. What accounts for the rise of scooters? Cars often aren’t the quickest way to travel in dense, urban areas. Many cities looked to bicycle-sharing services and bike lanes as a better option for shorter trips and as a way to reduce carbon emissions. Electric scooters, which can cost less than $2 per ride, are an offshoot of that. Investors looking for the next Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., the app-based car-hailing services, are adding to scooter-mania by pouring money into companies like Bird and Lime, touching off a city-by-city race to become the premier scooter brand. Not to be left behind, even Uber and Lyft are launching competing scooter businesses. 2. How prevalent are scooters? Bird, started by a former executive of Lyft and Uber, operates scooter services in about 40 U.S. cities, while Lime is in 23. Bird kicked off the trend in late 2017 with its launch in Santa Monica, California, and suddenly it seemed scooters were everywhere. Scores of unattended vehicles on city sidewalks have resulted in pushback from people complaining of urban chaos, and some cities have started to cap the number of scooters they’ll allow. But in most U.S. cities with sharing services, the number of scooters barely exceeds 1,000. By comparison, 45,000 Uber and Lyft drivers worked in San Francisco in 2017, according to the city’s attorney. 3. What about outside the U.S.? This year, Bird expanded to France and Israel. Lime has established a presence in France, Germany and Spain. Scooters are even more prevalent in parts of China, an early pioneer of the market. No company has been able to break into the U.K., however, because of strict laws that classify the scooters as motor vehicles requiring drivers’ licenses and subject to tax and insurance. Even then, regulators won’t allow scooters because they don’t comply with “normal vehicle construction rules.” Riding on the sidewalk isn’t an option, either, thanks to a 19th century law stipulating footpaths are for the sole use of pedestrians. 4. Who makes them? For now, most sharing services aren’t building their own vehicles. Instead, they buy scooters from Chinese manufacturers, with various levels of customization, and then brand them. From its inception, Lime has tried to distinguish itself by designing its own scooters. Uber has announced plans to integrate bike- and scooter-sharing services on its app, and has even begun to engineer its own scooters in San Francisco. 5. Is this a profitable business? Investors think they can be: The valuations of Bird Rides Inc. and its main competitor, Lime, are over $1 billion each. But skepticism is warranted. It could be a short-lived fad. Even if it isn’t, scooter companies must have the capital to absorb costs beyond acquiring fleets of vehicles, including maintaining them and charging their batteries daily. There’s little reason for riders to be loyal to one company, and if rivals compete by lowering prices, they could shave away much of their margins. Lime has said it can raise revenue from advertising, but this is an untested idea. Scooters could end up being one option in an integrated transportation service providing everything from short-term car rentals and bike-shares to ride-hailing and train tickets, putting the upstarts at a disadvantage to Uber, which seems to be moving in this direction. There’s also the question of how city regulations will affect scooter economics. 6. Are they legal? From the beginning, Bird and Lime said they had learned the lessons of ride-hailing companies, which had alienated many city governments by launching without explicit permission. Then both companies mimicked the “ask for forgiveness, not permission” strategy. As a result, the scooter-sharing companies have faced bans or cease-and-desist orders in a handful of cities, and city lawmakers have been quick to regulate them by requiring permits, limiting the number of vehicles, awarding exclusive franchises and allowing scooters to be parked only in designated areas. 7. Is this the next chapter in the fight over ride-hailing? Yes and no. The scooter industry is experiencing some of the same problems as ride-hailing, with aggressive startups butting heads with local governments. But there are key differences. With ride-hailing, entrenched taxi industries argued that unregulated upstarts had an unfair advantage. There is no such incumbent industry opposing scooters. Urban congestion and climate change have also made alternatives to automobiles more popular with city governments. The controversies over scooters may end up being just growing pains. 8. Is this the future of city transport? It’s too soon to tell. Bike-sharing hasn’t had a revolutionary effect in most U.S. cities. In many places, weather will make scooters a seasonal activity at best. Also holding them back is the country’s deep-seated automotive culture. Unlike in Europe, riding a bike isn’t seen as something a serious adult does to get around town, let alone taking a scooter. Transportation experts think city governments could change that attitude with protected lanes, convenient charging stations and dedicated parking spaces for scooters.

The electric scooter boom — and cities’ misguided attempts to squash it — explained,Vox,Vox,National,2018,9,10,"The electric scooter boom — and cities’ misguided attempts to squash it — explained. Cities that take their own rhetoric about sustainability seriously should embrace the scooter. This summer, cities across America fought a strange new menace: electric scooters. They were removed from the streets of Indianapolis in July and eliminated from Milwaukee in August. San Francisco, ahead of the curve as usual, scrapped them in May. New York, never quite as edgy as it likes to think it is, has just been preemptively making it clear that they’re illegal. But Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi believes they’re an important part of his company’s future, and here in Washington, DC, where I live, they seem awfully useful. After all, on a muggy mid-August morning, I found myself in a classic political journalist’s dilemma — I needed to get to Capitol Hill dressed appropriately for the old-school norms of the United States Congress, but I didn’t want to be a sweaty mess when I showed up. Given the heat and humidity, the modest walks involved in taking the Metro would have left me, wearing a suit and tie, drenched. A year or two ago, that would have meant taking a taxi or an Uber, with all the traffic congestion and pollution that implies. But in a scooter-friendly city in 2018, it meant a breezy ride on one of the electric scooters that were conveniently waiting around by the bike racks in front of the Vox offices. Scooters are, of course, not a panacea for urban transportation problems. But they do have a legitimate role to play in offering a direct point-to-point transportation option that is less physically demanding than a bicycle, cleaner than a car, and smaller than either. There’s also a particular reason scooters are booming today even though the basic idea of a board with wheels attached is very old. The contemporary electric scooter boom exists at the intersection of multiple technological trends — the falling price of batteries and GPS trackers, the near-ubiquity of smartphones, and the rising demand for space in central cities — that are collectively transforming our world. Where did these things come from? The scooter, as a technology, has existed since at least the early part of the 20th century, primarily as a toy for children (you can see a little girl riding one in Fritz Lang’s classic film M). The modern effort to establish scooters as an adult transportation option date to the introduction of the foldable Razor scooter in 1999, which launched a brief but intense scooter fad. John Leland reported in the New York Times the following year that “when historians recount New York’s summer of 2000, they will tell of plaster cows and of grown professionals on little chrome scooters, a confluence of cutesy infantilism that made even the political conventions seem grown up.” But as an adult transportation option, the Razor suffered from a critical flaw. As Leland wrote, “scootering is work, especially at rush hour ... by the time I reached the office my first morning, a 40-block ride, I was drenched in perspiration, my knee was bruised from a near tumble and my hands ached as if I’d been working a jackhammer.” At the end of the day, a human-propelled scooter, though fun, is simply a lot less comfortable than walking and a lot less mechanically efficient than a bicycle. Consequently, the main consequence of Razor popularizing an adult version of a somewhat obscure children’s toy was to greatly boost the popularity of scooters for small children, who have endlessly resilient knees but can’t operate a bike. My 3-year-old loves his scooter, and these days, any toddler-friendly playground is sure to be inundated with kids scootering around. The adult urban mobility conversation, meanwhile, shifted rapidly to the bicycle, which is a much more mechanically efficient way of transforming human muscle into forward momentum. And the urban cycling renaissance was paired with a newfound interest in the concept of municipal bicycle-sharing systems, originally pioneered in Rennes, France, and rapidly spreading to other cities. The basic mechanics of this generation of bike-share systems — in the US, typically operated by Motivate International, which runs Citi Bike in New York, Capital Bikeshare in DC, Divvy in Chicago, Blue Bikes in Boston, Nice Ride in the Twin Cities, and GoBike in the Bay Area — are simple. You go to a docking station, get a bike, pedal it around to another station, and lock up the bike there. But just as docked bike systems were spreading in popularity across the world, a parallel technological development — the smartphone — was rapidly rendering them obsolete. The rise of dockless Superficially, the function of the bike-share dock is to lock up the bicycle so a non-paying customer can’t steal it. In practice, however, locking a bicycle wheel is a fairly trivial task. The real purpose of the dock was to make the bicycles discoverable. Bikes could be found at a series of fixed locations, and so users would know where they were. But increasingly cheap GPS chips and ubiquitous smartphones have allowed for the development of dockless bicycle sharing networks. In a dockless system, you simply leave the bicycle wherever you happen to be at the end of the ride. If you want to find a bike, you fire up the company’s app on your smartphone, and GPS chips in the bikes let you know where they are. This is much more convenient and also allows, in principle, for much freer entry and exit of the market from private companies, which can simply place bikes on the sidewalk rather than needing to construct permanent docking stations (at significant expense and with meaningful municipal involvement). And, indeed, in China, where car ownership rates are lower, population densities are higher, and the regulatory climate is friendly, dockless bicycle share has become a huge hit that’s captured a substantial swath of the transportation market. In America, of course, every option that isn’t driving a car everywhere remains decidedly non-mainstream. And the prospect of private companies suddenly dumping piles of bikes on the sidewalk without 10 rounds of community review cuts against the prevailing political culture in most large American cities. The threat that dockless systems could undermine docked systems in which cities had already invested has also weighed on city officials’ minds. Consequently, the trend in a variety of cities has been to cap the number of dockless bikes or otherwise regulate them in ways that make Chinese-style ubiquity difficult. That, in turn, creates large financial incentives for dockless companies to charge higher prices and start competing on quality. In the mobility market, that meant incorporating electric motors and shifting to either e-bikes or electric scooters. It’s time to take scooters seriously While I find the regulatory crackdown on dockless bike share to be moderately ill-advised, the basic impetus to shift business models away from bicycles and toward slightly more expensive electric scooters is fundamentally sound. It’s natural and correct that dockless bikes would dominate in China, a country that is still relatively poor and where cycling is a mainstream transportation option due to the large number of people for whom the financial burdens of car ownership are simply too great. The revival of interest in bicycle commuting in the West, by contrast, is fundamentally about environmental sustainability and the appeal of dense, pedestrian-oriented urban neighborhoods relative to auto-oriented suburban ones. And for those purposes, the electric scooter works considerably better than a bicycle. For starters, you don’t need to do the actual work of pedaling a bicycle. It’s a lazier, rather than less lazy, alternative to walking, which makes it more competitive with the dominant car-commuting lifestyle in the United States. That also makes it a lot friendlier to people who’d like to move about the city in business attire without showing up for meetings covered in sweat. Scooters are also physically smaller than bicycles, meaning they’re easier to maneuver and, perhaps more important, take up less space when parked. And as with so much else in urban politics, at the end of the day, the scooter controversy is on some level primarily about parking. Scooter haters don’t like the idea of sidewalks littered with parked scooters, and car drivers don’t like the idea of giving up more curbside space for dedicated lanes in which bikes and scooters can safely travel. And of course it’s true that as long as all non-automobile modes of transportation are forced to share a small minority of public space, that conflict between scooter fans and pedestrians is inevitable. Vox’s Umair Irfan suggested optimistically that “perhaps one of the greatest benefits of scooters will be that they will force a larger discussion of whom or what we prioritize when we design cities.” If that comes to pass, then the scooter revolution will undoubtedly be change for the better. The tragic reality, however, is that so far neither the revolution nor the larger discussion has happened. Cities have instead tended to take auto-centric urban design for granted and simply debated how scooters might best fit into that. That’s a huge mistake. Cars (and before them, railroads) transformed the world, in part because they’re inherently useful but largely because we decided to build infrastructure that allows them to be useful rather than decreeing that they should be banned because they were a nuisance to the existing users of the old infrastructure. Scooters themselves aren’t going to change the world. But they represent change for the better — change driven by the intersection of ongoing technological changes that have transformed many areas of life and will continue to do so. And the scooter backlash reflects, fundamentally, a refusal to consider the reality that if we want different outcomes in terms of sustainability, mobility, and urban form, we need to be willing to embrace and adapt to change.",https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/10/17631318/electric-scooters-bird-city-regulations-sustainability
A US city thinks electric scooters are “toys” and should be ridden on the sidewalk,Quartz,,National,2018,9,11,"A US city thinks electric scooters are “toys” and should be ridden on the sidewalk. Scorned by San Francisco, Lyft last week launched electric scooters in Denver, Colorado. Lyft’s scooters are available in Denver from 6am to 8pm. They cost $1 to unlock and $0.15 per minute, with the clock starting when you reserve. Denver has also issued permits for up to 350 dockless electric scooters to Bird, Lime, Razor, and Spin. The city has come a long way since it seized and impounded hundreds of Lime and Bird scooters, fining the companies $150 per seized device, earlier this summer. A popular critique of scooters in other US cities has been that scooters are a danger to pedestrians because people ride them, improperly, on the sidewalk. California prohibits motorized scooters from being ridden on sidewalks. That didn’t stop people from doing it anyway. One concerned San Franciscan wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle about a hit-and-scoot she observed with a scooter and a pedestrian in Oakland earlier this month. ”The event of electric scooters on city sidewalks is a disaster,” the letter writer said. In Denver, however, the opposite is true: Electric scooters can only operate on the sidewalk. According to guidelines issued by Denver’s Department of Public Works for its dockless vehicle pilot program, “e-scooters are considered ‘toy vehicles’ and are not allowed in the bike lanes or in general traffic.” Toy vehicles! These scooters aren’t technically designed for children, given that they generally travel around 15 mph and can carry riders weighing up to 200 pounds. But maybe in a sense they are. “Denver Public Works is navigating through local and state law to see if we can allow electric scooters in the bike lanes, but we’re not there yet,” Heather Burke, a public work spokeswoman, said in an email. Lyft’s FAQ for scooter riders in Denver dutifully notes this. “You should only ride the scooter on sidewalks—don’t ride in the street, in bike lanes, within designated parks, or on park trails,” Lyft instructs riders. “Please yield to pedestrians when riding on sidewalks.” Hopefully those sidewalks don’t get too crowded.",https://qz.com/1386718/denver-says-electric-scooters-are-toys-and-should-be-ridden-on-the-sidewalk/
Don’t blame the scooters. Blame the streets.,Vox,Vox,National,2018,9,18,"Don’t blame the scooters. Blame the streets. This isn’t the first time a transportation technology has robbed pedestrians of space. The photos suggest they’re a nuisance. The surveys indicate that they’re beloved. Dockless electric scooters made waves when companies released them to city sidewalks, often without permission. Unfortunately for pedestrians, that meant the loss of valuable real estate. This is not the first time that a transportation technology has robbed pedestrians of space. “In the 1920s and 1930s we start seeing many more cars in cities. It is not only the pedestrians that are afraid. Cities are also concerned with issues of liability,” Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, a UCLA professor of urban planning, told Vox. “We start seeing the first pedestrian automobile crashes. And so the cities start, really, segregating the two types of uses — the pedestrian circulation from the bigger circulation.” Space in cities, especially on the sidewalk, is pretty tight these days. But we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the potential of electric scooters. These lightweight vehicles and their counterparts could solve a key transportation access issue: the “last mile.” Personal vehicles, taxis, and companies like Lyft or Uber have provided the most realistic travel option for those far from a neighborhood subway station or bus stop. But the growing popularity of tiny vehicles — Segways, electric skateboards, and now scooters — may change the status quo. It’s a worthy goal. In several American cities, space alloted to cars dominates other land uses. In places like New York City, the political debate over congestion pricing rages. Decades of underinvestment across the country have left train and bus systems overburdened. The rise of dockless individual transport is about a fundamental shift in inner-city transit. You can watch the video above to learn about the scooters, the last mile problem, and how “complete streets” could push city streets into the future.",https://www.vox.com/videos/2018/9/18/17875178/electric-dockless-scooters-streets-urban-planning
The electric scooter craze is officially one year old — what’s next?,The Verge,Vox,National,2018,9,20,"The electric scooter craze is officially one year old — what’s next? Bird and Lime are celebrating their first year in operation by touting strong ridership numbers, but challenges lie ahead. The electric scooter frenzy is turning one. The two companies that kicked off the new transit trend when they first started dropping motorized scooters on city streets without permission a year ago — Bird and Lime — are celebrating their first 12 months (or in Lime’s case, 14 months) in operation by touting strong ridership numbers and renewed promises to work collaboratively with cities. The companies are also reflecting on what comes next for this much-hyped and certainly polarizing new mode of transportation. But while the scooter startups are busy patting themselves on the back for a year of solid growth, they are also keeping a nervous eye on the moves of Uber and Lyft, which are looking to take big bites out of their market share. Earlier this month, Lyft launched its first scooter sharing service in Denver. Next was Santa Monica, where Uber is also expected to drop its first scooters. Other startups are growing aggressively, which suggests the early pioneers can’t afford any missteps if they hope to maintain their pole position. Bird first launched its scooter sharing service in Santa Monica in September 2017. Since then, it has grown to over 100 cities, facilitated over 10 million rides, and raised cash at an unprecedented pace. It recently became the fastest startup to achieve a $2 billion valuation. If Uber and Lyft were the first phase of ride-sharing, then electric scooters represent “ride-sharing 2.0,” said Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden in an interview with The Verge. As Bird enters its second year, VanderZanden says the company is “doubling down” on its recently announced “GovTech” collaboration with cities, in an effort to make shared e-scooters “the most community-focused, people-friendly, car-reducing, and safest mobility solution.” VanderZaden said he had no idea how popular the scooters would be when he launched Bird a year ago — nor did he anticipate the fierce backlash. “I certainly didn’t expect it to be as polarizing,” he said. “And I didn’t think we would be able to do 10 million rides.” Lyft only did 1 million rides in its first 15 months, VanderZaden notes by comparison. “It doesn’t mean we don’t have a lot of work ahead to work with cities to see how do we make it less polarizing,” he added. Dedicated parking, so scooters aren’t left blocking sidewalks or littered in front of businesses that don’t want them, is one challenge. To that end, Bird recently unveiled a miniature “parklet” in Santa Monica that could serve as a model for the future. Building a better, more rugged scooter is another goal. VanderZanden said Bird is working on its future vehicle now, which includes a 55 percent more powerful battery, more durable shaft, fewer exposed cables, and solid core tires. The present model isn’t really designed for heavy fleet use, and problems with the supply chain could slow down Bird’s growth, according to The Information. Bird’s main competitor, Lime, is celebrating its own milestone. After 14 months in operation, the San Francisco-based company says it hit 11.5 million rides on its shared scooters and bikes. It took Lime just one year to get to 6 million rides, and another two months after that to nearly double that figure. Like Bird, Lime operates in 100 cities across the globe, and the company plans to expand into 50 new markets before the end of the year. Lime is particularly focused on launching in global markets: it recently landed in Paris, and it’s eyeing other international cities for launch, too. All of this probably sounds familiar to anyone who has been following the ride-hailing industry for the last half-decade. In the early days, Uber’s mantra was “growth above all else.” Launch in a city unannounced, win over customers despite protests from regulators and established players, then beg for forgiveness. The scooter companies followed that playbook in the early months. Uber was especially good at congratulating itself every time it hit a new trip milestone: 1 billion rides, 2 billion, 5 billion, etc. Earlier this month, Lyft completed its one billionth trip. These are nice, round numbers that are obviously worth celebrating, but they’re largely meaningless compared to more tangible metrics like gross bookings, revenue, and profit. It’s also not the numbers that are most relevant to cities. How these companies deal with local governments going forward will remain a sticking point for the scooter industry. The earliest markets, like San Francisco and Los Angeles, have introduced new regulatory schemes to better manage the distribution and deployment of dock-less scooters on their streets. Other cities are following suit, ordering the scooter companies to pack up their fleets until regulators can finalize new permitting rules. “What’s been most surprising from a public perspective is the pace at which the e-scooters are being formalized into cities,” Juan Matute, deputy director of the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, said in an email. “They provide a direct and tangible mobility benefit. Now a year after launch, Santa Monica, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities have formalized their existence. The public sector doesn’t always move that fast, but I think that it has is estimate to the e-scooters viability as a beneficial, zero emissions, low-footprint mode for places seeking to move beyond the dominance of the automobile.” As scooter-related injuries rise and personal-injury attorneys circle, cities are demanding more detailed safety plans from the scooter startups. The Washington Post recently reported that ER doctors in seven cities said they are seeing spikes in severe accidents after scooters launched on their streets. VanderZanden said all of Bird’s scooters are capped at 15 mph, whether cities require it or not. And the company also introduced “geo-speed limiting” feature, so the scooters automatically slow down to 8 mph when, for example, entering the beach bike path of Santa Monica. Cities also want access to anonymize data, such as the number scooters operating on their streets and the types of trips (starting and ending locations) that riders are making, as they think about how these new devices fit into their overall transportation systems. Bird and Lime both say they are willing to share that data. But they’re still coming to terms with new restrictions imposed by cities. “They’re a weird new category of small transportation that’s also super fun and helps fill the gap in existing transportation networks,” said Mike Ramsey, a mobility analyst at Gartner. “All that said, Uber and Lyft created clear lessons. And cities are snapping back on this. Laws are being created. The fun will be wrung out of the scooters to a certain extent.”",https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17878676/electric-scooter-bird-lime-uber-lyft
Hospital ER reports 161 percent spike in visits involving electric scooters,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,9,24,"Hospital ER reports 161 percent spike in visits involving electric scooters. The injuries may reflect a fraction of Salt Lake City’s injured riders, doctors say. As injured electric-scooter riders pour into emergency departments across the country, doctors have scrambled to document a trend that many view as a growing public safety crisis. A detailed statistical portrait of that crisis won’t be available for another year, emergency physicians say, but some early samples are beginning to emerge. In Salt Lake City — where dockless electric scooters have been on city streets since June — one hospital says it has seen a 161 percent increase in the number of visits involving scooters after comparing its latest statistics with the same three-month period a year earlier. Between June and September 2017, physicians at University of Utah Health’s emergency room treated eight patients injured by scooters, although those were probably people’s personal devices and not the electric fleet vehicles owned by companies such as Bird, Lime and Skip. During the same period this year, that number had climbed to 21, according to Troy Madsen, a doctor who practices at University of Utah Health’s emergency department. “Most of the patients with these injuries specifically reported that they were riding an e-scooter or a rental scooter,” Madsen said, noting that they ranged in age from 20 to 50 years old and were often injured attempting to catch themselves during a fall. “Interestingly, more than 80 percent of the injuries this year happened between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15, which would correspond with the increasing popularity and availability of the e-scooters.” “It’s worth noting that these were only emergency department visits,” he added. “Patients with more minor injuries may have gone to an urgent care, and the patients we saw were probably those with more significant injuries who required a higher level of care in an emergency department.” The hospital reported that nearly half of this year’s injuries were fractures and dislocations of ankles, wrists, elbows and shoulders, as well as several cases of sprains and lacerations. Emergency physicians also treated several head injuries, and multiple patients told doctors they were intoxicated and not wearing a helmet when they were injured. In response to the hospital’s figures, a Bird spokesman said: “E-scooters are a new mode of transportation and that’s one reason why safety is our top priority at Bird. “We understand the temptation to focus on any increase in incidents, but it’s wrong to compare a period when there were no e-scooters to today when they are being used by thousands of riders in dozens of U.S. cities.” “The true danger on our roads is cars,” the spokesman added. “According to the CDC [cdc.gov], almost 129,000 pedestrians are treated in ERs for injuries related to car crashes in the US in a year. Car accidents are one of the leading causes [cdc.gov] of death.” Emergency physicians noted that their statistics may represent a fraction of Salt Lake City’s electric-scooter injuries. University of Utah Health’s emergency department is “fairly close to the downtown area,” where most scooters for rent are located, but there are other emergency departments even closer, Madsen said. Emergency physicians in a dozen cities around the country have told The Washington Post that they are seeing a spike in scooter accidents. In seven cities, those physicians are regularly seeing “severe” injuries — including head traumas — that were sustained from scooters malfunctioning or flipping over on uneven surfaces, as well as riders being hit by cars or colliding with pedestrians. Some safety experts have raised questions about the gig economy that companies such as Bird rely on to maintain their growing fleets. The company has posted ads for mechanics on Craigslist that say experience is not necessary, in addition to providing training for new hires via YouTube videos. Videos posted online show Bird scooters with accelerators stuck in place and with wobbly handlebars and loose brakes. “I just signed up to be a Bird mechanic,” one mechanic says on camera. “I realized there are a very large amount of scooters with problems.” Last week, the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office revealed that a 24-year-old Dallas man who fell off a Lime scooter on his way home from work this month was killed by blunt-force injuries to the head.

Scooting Toward Confrontation,U.S. News,,National,2018,10,2,"Scooting Toward Confrontation. The rapid rise of electric scooters has inspired a fierce debate over the hot new technology’s appropriate place in urban life. On June 17, David Petersen, a 62-year-old accountant turned street performer, arrived at Santa Monica Pier in late morning, ready for another day's work. Petersen, who performs under the stage name Davy.Rocks, earns his living by singing bold renditions of a variety of popular songs – Britney Spears' ""Baby One More Time,"" Dr. Dre's ""The Next Episode"" – accompanied by flamboyant, high-energy dance moves. By 2:30 that afternoon, after winning a prime lottery spot on the boardwalk across from the trapeze school, Petersen was shirtless, wearing his customary headset and Muay Thai shorts, dazzling a crowd of several dozen onlookers. He was mid-song when he turned around, toward the water, to acknowledge a group of particularly enthusiastic fans. The next thing he knew he was lying flat, staring up at an unshaven 20-something barely hanging on to his Bird electric scooter. ""What the f--- dude?"" he remembers the rider saying. ""And then he took off."" Petersen suffered a broken radius and a detached bicep that required surgery, sidelining him for eight weeks. Against his doctor's orders, he's since returned to performing, but he feels more cautious and worries his ""robocop"" arm brace detracts from his usual appeal. ""It's kind of funny, like, an old guy that's in really good shape dancing around,"" he says. ""Now there's an element of sorrow.…'Why is he screwed up like that?'"" After initially viewing electric scooters as a cool trend, Peterson has joined a growing crowd of Santa Monica, California residents who consider them a serious threat to the urban landscape. ""It kind of went from this peaceful, laid-back environment to really tense,"" he says of his beachside city. ""I like to describe it as like a plague of locusts, swarming over the land, devouring everything in its path."" Electric scooters, indeed, are suddenly everywhere. After debuting in Southern California last fall, the stand-up scooters, which are rented by smartphone app and can be picked up and dropped off anywhere in a given city, quickly emerged as America's newest transportation craze, winning converts at ""an unprecedented pace"" in recent history and conquering dozens of cities, from Austin to Washington, virtually overnight. But while proponents praise the slim, agile scooters as a fun, convenient new transit option for congested metro areas, their rise has also set off a frenzied backlash, inspiring a fierce debate over a hot new technology's appropriate place in urban life. ""I think the bigger battle is over how we collectively use public space,"" says Brooks Rainwater, a senior executive with the National League of Cities. ""That's what the larger conversation is."" Bird, the first company to launch shared electric scooters in the United States, unrolled its first fleet – or flock – in Santa Monica last September. Their scooters have since appeared in some 70 municipalities across the country, including 17 in California, as well as Paris and Tel Aviv and dozens of college campuses. Lime, the biggest of a dozen or more competitors, has landed in more than 80 American municipalities. The industry's explosive growth has been driven by hundreds of millions in venture capital funding, and largely followed the cutthroat expansion ethos that characterized the growth of ride sharing apps. ""We're not going to be happy till there are more Birds than cars,"" Travis VanderZanden, the company's 39-year-old founder and CEO – a former executive at both Lyft and Uber – told the New York Times earlier this year. According to a recent study by the research group Populus, a majority of Americans familiar with the technology are pro-scooter – 70 percent of respondents in 11 major cities viewed them favorably – and its rapid adoption rate suggests the electric scooter market could potentially rival even the massive ridesharing industry. For riders, the benefits are clear: Most rentals cost $1 plus $.15 per minute, a price that means short trips likely end up cheaper than an Uber ride or bike share rental. For commuters, electric scooters mean a quicker trip to a train station or bus stop. They're attractive to professionals who don't want to sweat striding across town to a meeting and to women whose clothing precludes a bike ride. There's even preliminary evidence that electric scooters, for many more accessible than bikes, can help reduce the persistent gender and income gaps found in human-powered transportation. ""Not every person in cities learns how to ride a bike, especially lower income residents,"" says Sarah Kaufman, an urban planning professor at New York University. ""It's yet another option."" And the rise of a new electric technology, naturally, also means less pollution. Lime, in a report released this summer, after the company had provided more than 6 million electric scooter and dockless bike-share rides, claimed it had saved more than 5 million pounds of carbon emissions – an amount equivalent to 140 times the annual per capita carbon output in the United States. In San Francisco, more than half of Lime's survey respondents said they might have taken a car on their latest trip if they hadn't used an electric scooter – evidence, if preliminary, that the technology is in fact reducing car traffic. ""These are a little faster than the Birds,"" said Ben Mothershead, standing over a Lime electric scooter propped against a parking lot fence in downtown Detroit on a recent evening. Earlier this summer, Mothershead, a 24-year-old who works for an energy waste reduction company, decided to go carless – a rare move in transit-starved Detroit. The electric scooters have helped, especially after his bike tire was stolen. ""Can I really do this?"" he remembers thinking. ""So far it's working great."" Lime and Bird both arrived in Detroit in late summer, and, unsurprisingly, quickly proved popular: A few blocks from Mothershead, two women standing on electric scooters were chatting outside a Hard Rock Cafe; a father and daughter, apparently riding for fun, scooted a few laps around Campus Martius Park, the city's main downtown plaza, before heading toward the river. As workers flooded out of office buildings, other riders – young professionals in suits, students wearing backpacks – occasionally whizzed by on the sidewalk or in the street, and several unattended machines cluttered street corners. But in relatively spacious Detroit, the scooters seemed to mostly blend with the existing urban landscape. Elsewhere, many believe scooters have ruined it. While local laws often dictate scooters can only be used in the street or bike lanes, many riders don't know or ignore the rules, prompting a physical competition for pedestrian space. Business owners cite blocked front doors. Walkers complain of ugly sidewalk hazards. Helmet requirements are mostly ignored. While no comprehensive scooter-related injury data is yet available, emergency room doctors across the country are reporting spikes in scooter-caused injuries like broken wrists, facial lacerations and blunt head trauma. In Dallas a 24-year-old rider died from head injuries after falling off his electric scooter; in Washington, a 20-year-old rider was killed after colliding with an SUV. In Southern California, collisions have become so frequent that lawyers are advertising scooter-specific personal injury practices. ""It's an epidemic,"" says Catherine Lerer, who has practices in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. In just the past few months, Lerer says, she's received more than 200 scooter-related injury calls from pedestrians who were hit or, more commonly, from riders hurt when their scooters malfunctioned, usually when the brakes gave out. Lerer is pursuing dozens of personal injury cases against the companies, which she says have dodged accountability. In just a few months, she says, electric scooter injuries – a category that didn't exist a year ago – has become her most common inquiry, and Santa Monica has become a danger zone. ""[Residents] don't feel safe anymore,"" Lerer says. ""When they're walking the city they don't feel safe – they feel like they constantly have to be on guard."" Both Bird and Lime have repeatedly defended their commitment to safety, emphasizing that riders must comply with local laws and often partnering with cities in public service campaigns. While both companies provide free helmets and tell riders to wear them, Bird also sponsored a bill, passed in late September, that removes California's helmet requirement. The company did not directly address an inquiry from U.S. News regarding the apparent hypocrisy. ""The outcome of this legislative process will not change Bird's ongoing efforts to promote the safe riding of our vehicles,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""We strongly encourage all riders to wear helmets."" In Los Angeles and elsewhere, electric scooters have also struck a deeper nerve. To many, the newly ubiquitous technology represents the latest cultural assault by a notoriously aggressive tech industry, and the intrusion has only been amplified by bad behavior: Riders, usually young, zigzag through crowds or haphazardly scatter the machines. Companies, upon debuting in new cities, often drop hundreds of scooters overnight, blindsiding authorities and instantly disrupting lifestyles. In response, enraged citizens have begun a remarkably zealous anti-scooter campaign: Bird Graveyard, an Instagram account dedicated to celebrating the destruction of electric scooters, has more than 40,000 followers and is deluged by submissions. Popular videos include scooters being incinerated, drowned at sea and defecated on by dogs. ""I hate Birds more than anyone,"" Hassan Galedary, a 32-year-old filmmaker and anti-scooter ""insurgent,"" told the Los Angeles Times. ""They suck. People who ride them suck."" Yet the scooters' immense popularity, experts say, also reveals a need for them: In urban areas across the country, people increasingly want to move away from car travel but are often limited by existing infrastructure. The introduction of electric scooters has caused tremendous friction and real problems, especially safety, but it's also filled a void. ""What cities need to be doing is planning for whatever comes next, or planning for this clear desire for residents to use active transport,"" says NYU's Kaufman. The technology needs to be better integrated, she argues, but the upside is huge. ""If it can get people out of cars and on their two feet, it's a net benefit.""",https://www.usnews.com/news/cities/articles/2018-10-02/how-electric-scooters-are-transforming-cities
Popularity of Electric Scooters Creates Jobs for 'Juicers',Voa,,National,2018,10,9,"Popularity of Electric Scooters Creates Jobs for 'Juicers'. You see them everywhere in U.S. cities — young and old riding rented electric-powered scooters. When they are done, they can leave the scooters anywhere. Someone has to find and charge the scooters, then return them to designated hot spots where customers can use them the next day. And that has given rise to a new line of work — scooter juicers. Shivali Sharma is a stay-at-home mom in San Jose, California, and a Marine staff sergeant on medical leave. She works as a juicer to earn money while her boys sleep. “The hunt is fun,” she said. It’s a new kind of piece work, made possible by GPS and phone apps. Sharma and her family noticed the scooters being left on their streets. It intrigued them. “We were like, ‘What is this scooter doing? Who does it belong to?’” she said. Then they heard about juicing and signed up. The company sent them charging stations. For the past several months, Sharma’s routine is set. Each night, this single mom leaves her twins with her parents and checks her phone app for Lime scooters scattered around the city, sending out GPS locator signals, all needing to be charged. She earns $6 per scooter, more if the scooter is harder to reach. FILE - In this July 24, 2018, file photo, riders make their way across a street on Bird electric scooters in the Venice Beach section of Los Angeles. Charging scooters at home For the scooter companies, juicers solve two problems — finding the scooters and then using their own electricity to charge them before putting them back on the streets. The competition among the juicers is part of the appeal, something Lime, one of the scooter companies, didn’t expect. “The fact that juicers compare it to Pokemon Go is a happy accident,” said Will Lee, product manager at Lime, a San Francisco-based electric bike and scooter company. “Now that we've hit on this motivation, this gamification motivation among the juicers, we have done things to maybe amplify it or try to feed into folks' natural desire to play the game.” Gamification of work To increase juicers’ engagement as the night progresses, Lime raises the dollar amount a juicer can get per scooter. A scooter in the middle of a homeless encampment or one on the outer reaches of a town may go for $10, Sharma said. The company plans to create levels of juicers, like a video game. Sharma, who has harvested more than 1,000 scooters, may be considered a super juicer. She can get 29 scooters in her truck. The work can be tiring. Each scooter weighs 15 kilos. Dealing with the competition is part of the gig. “There's been many instances where I've been standing right next to a scooter just waiting for my app to kick in so I can collect the scooter,” she said. “Somebody’s come up from behind me just taking it, like, don't you see me standing here?” Sharma’s nightly hunt takes a lot of stamina. She works six nights a week, and wakes up at 3:30 a.m. to put all the scooters around the city before 7 a.m. She gets paid by 7:30 a.m. each day. As the gig economy grows, and more jobs like juicers are created, people like Sharma, who are willing to hustle, are finding new kinds of work.",https://www.voanews.com/silicon-valley-technology/popularity-electric-scooters-creates-jobs-juicers
The Electric Future Will Run on Two Wheels,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,10,13,"The Electric Future Will Run on Two Wheels. For much of the emerging world, the key to reducing pollution is making the transition to battery-powered motorcycles and scooters. Given recent market turmoil, it would easy to overlook the upcoming IPO of Niu Technologies, a Chinese manufacturer of electric mopeds. The $95 million the company plans to raise is a pittance compared to the billions burnt by Tesla Inc. But, the technologies developed by Niu and other pioneers of electric two-wheel vehicles will transform transportation as much as anything dreamed up by the likes of Elon Musk. Until recently, electric motorcycles and scooters received far less global attention than electric cars. That’s beginning to change, especially in India, where two-wheelers -- predominantly motorcycles -- account for 76 percent of vehicles on the roads and a whopping 30 percent of the country's pollution. In Southeast Asia's biggest economies, the number of households that own two-wheelers exceeds 80 percent. Cleaning up the region’s air means reducing emissions from two-wheelers. Electric cars, even cheap ones, won't solve the problem. Cost is the first and tallest barrier. In India, a new, entry-level commuter motorcycle can cost less than $500 (and, on the secondhand market, far less). Traffic is the next burden. In the megacities of emerging Asia, jams are notoriously bad and getting worse. In Mumbai, the average speed of city buses has declined from 10 miles per hour to 5.5 miles per hour over the last decade. Little wonder that even commuters who can afford a car often look to bikes and scooters to get around. For similar reasons, the region's booming e-commerce industry heavily relies upon two-wheeled transport for deliveries. Finally, there’s the matter of parking. Beijing is home to approximately twice as many cars as parking spaces -- a ratio that’s likely to grow. The problem is common throughout the developing world and made worse by spiraling real estate costs, especially in the central parts of cities. The good news is that Asia's emerging middle class seems open to the idea of e-scooters if the price is right and charging is convenient. In China, low-speed electric bicycles powered by bulky lead-acid batteries have replaced many traditional motorcycles and scooters, especially given more stringent emissions rules. They're cheap, and -- unlike electric cars -- the batteries can be charged at home or at the office. Today there are 200 million them, with 30 million more added every year. There's a limit to what current electric two-wheelers can accomplish, mostly due to the short lifespans and ranges of their lead-acid batteries. To match the performance of a traditional motorcycle or scooter, e-bikes would require compact, lightweight, and reliable lithium-ion batteries similar to those that power everything from iPhones to Teslas. Traditionally, the costs of lithium-ion batteries have made vehicles powered by them too expensive for emerging markets. But prices are falling precipitously: Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts they'll decline 73 percent by 2030. While that may still not be enough to make electric cars broadly affordable, it's a good bet that two-wheelers will be. In fact, electric scooters and motorcycles are already coming down in price. Models offered by Hero Electric -- a division of India's biggest two-wheeler manufacturer -- are price-competitive with low-cost motorcycles. Even better, once a buyer gets past the purchase price, overall cost of ownership is oftentimes cheaper than with traditional two-wheelers (especially when oil prices are high). The lack of charging stations is a bigger problem, one that plagues electric-vehicle owners of all kinds across Asia. It’s a particularly serious issue for commercial electric two-wheel operators, especially those focused on deliveries over wide geographies. For now, developers are likely to focus most intently on building charging stations along high-volume commuter corridors and in more affluent neighborhoods. One solution is being developed by Honda Motors: a scooter with a detachable, switchable battery targeted to the Southeast Asian market. To be released in 2019, the battery will also be capable of charging phones and other electronics, powering lights -- even sending electricity to the grid. For consumers in regions with less-than-reliable power supplies, that's a double inducement. Ultimately, just as a switch to electric cars will require the support of governments, so too will the shift to electric two-wheelers. Installing more charging stations should be a priority. An effort should be made to universalize the form factor of two-wheeler batteries and to support the development of switching stations. And finally, governments should continue to focus regulations on reducing transportation pollution. Faced with demand, the market will respond.",https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-14/electric-scooters-are-the-future-of-transportation
"As E-Scooters Roll Into American Cities, So Do Safety Concerns",NPR,NPR,National,2018,10,15,"As E-Scooters Roll Into American Cities, So Do Safety Concerns. Over the past year, companies have been rolling out electric scooters by the thousands in cities across the country — from Milwaukee to Washington, D.C., to Lubbock, Texas. People download the app, find a nearby scooter and then just unlock and ride. But as these shared scooters have spread, so have concerns about safety. Portland, Oregon, is in the middle of a four-month e-scooter pilot program. You see these scooters everywhere — parked on sidewalks (they don't require docking stations, which most shared bikes do), taking fast corners and zipping through traffic. But something you don't see much of: helmets. On a recent weekend, a 32-year-old woman who didn't want to give her name because she's breaking the city's helmet rule is riding for the first time with some of her friends. None of them are wearing helmets, which both the city and the scooter company require — with good reason. ""One of our friends almost just got run over. The brake lights on theirs don't work,"" she says. Part of the draw of these scooters is their flexibility — most riders we talked to hopped on a scooter on the spur of the moment. And, given the fact that most people would not want to share helmets with strangers (nor could integrity and safety be ensured if they did,) they don't come with helmets attached. So people end up riding without any safety gear. Yes, this is against the rules, but many people just don't want to carry around helmets. Data from bicycles suggest that people participating in share programs have lower rates of accidents than those using their own vehicle. And many transportation advocates point to the fact that helmet requirements deter bike usage. Still, helmets provide protection. Riding a scooter is very different from riding a bike. They accelerate without you pedaling, have a different center of balance and take some getting used to — for both riders and the cars driving around them. And people on e-scooters are starting to show up in emergency rooms with injuries. ""We've seen things from broken bones to punctured lungs to shattered pelvis,"" says Catherine Juillard, a trauma surgeon at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco. While many cities are collecting transportation injury data, San Francisco is taking a comprehensive, science-based approach through its Vision Zero SF Injury Prevention Research (VZIPR) Collaborative. Juillard is a member. The collaborative aims to standardize data collection and work with the city to get a fuller picture of exactly what these injuries reveal. Are they happening at particular intersections, are people fracturing skulls or spraining ankles, or are some types of scooters more dangerous than others? And based on that, they'll figure out the next steps. Other cities are watching closely. ""Technology and disruption — when they enter the sector of transportation, [they're] also entering the sector of public health. So it becomes a different ballgame, and we need to make sure that we're doing it safely,"" Juillard says. California has welcomed e-scooters — even changing the law so adult riders don't have to wear helmets. Whereas other places, like Seattle, are so concerned about injures that they're not allowing e-scooters at all. As a trauma surgeon, Juillard has seen the dangers. But she also sees the potential — because San Francisco is a city dealing with a lot of car traffic. And so is Portland. ""We're going to have many more thousands of jobs, many more thousands of residents — we're not going to be building many more thousands of streets,"" says John Brady, spokesman for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. To continue to have a city that works — that moves — Portland wants to welcome innovation. Knowing you can just hop on a scooter for a few bucks might encourage more people to leave their cars at home. But Portland wants to make sure these innovations meet all of the city's transportation goals: moving people efficiently, cutting emissions, and making each trip as safe as possible. ""If at the same time we're seeing a rise in injuries, but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion, is that a trade-off from a public agency standpoint that we think is a good one? I don't know. And we don't know yet,"" Brady says. Portland, of course, does not want a rise in injuries — they're handing out free helmets and conducting a public education campaign. Brady says the city has given out about 500 helmets (the city currently has 2,000 scooters on the street.) And the scooter companies are working on distributing free helmets across the country — both directly on the streets in the cities they serve, and through mail-in programs. Bird scooter company reports distributing more than 50,000 helmets, and Lime (which also offers dockless bikes) reports having distributed tens of thousands of helmets. But you only have to look at the scooters zipping by in the street to see that this is a big change in how people move around in a city. Cars and scooters are still learning how to be around each other, and not many people are wearing helmets. Cities and physicians will get a better sense of scooter dangers as the data come in over the next few months. In the meantime, scoot safely. Or you could always walk.",https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/15/656270365/as-e-scooters-roll-into-american-cities-so-do-safety-concerns
Five Ways to Redesign Cities for the Scooter Era,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2018,10,16,"Five Ways to Redesign Cities for the Scooter Era. The rise of electric scooters in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco has led to no small amount of debate and angry community board meetings, but it seems safe to say that the mobility toothpaste has already been squeezed out of that transportation tube. The promise of cheap, easily available, motorized personal transportation is too alluring to be legislated out of existence. So cities will have to design their way toward a solution. This is no small task, as more than a century of urban design championed the car above all else, leading to public spaces where the majority of the space is devoted to private vehicles. This has meant that most cities find themselves in an awkward phase: designed for one form of transportation, but increasingly serving as a stage for newer, unexpected forms of mobility. Janette Sadik-Khan, a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, doesn’t blame the scooters. “The problem isn’t the mode. The underlying problem is street management and the failure of imagination to update our streets,” says Sadik-Khan, who now advises other cities on transit policy as a consultant at Bloomberg Associates, a firm started by Michael Bloomberg, founder and owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. “It’s not that these riders are a bunch of outlaws,” she says. “It’s that the infrastructure hasn’t kept up with the changes on the street, and the street is forcing people to wing it.” So what can a city do to adapt to a world where more people use vehicles such as scooters and bikes in place of cars? An informal survey of design professionals came up with some real-world solutions. Some are physical, some behavioral, but deployed in concert they could radically change the way a city moves. Roundabouts Every traffic engineer’s favorite way to design an automotive intersection may be the best way to manage bike and scooter traffic as well. Instead of placing riders at low-visibility street crossings—which endanger pedestrians and drivers, as well as scooter and bike users—directing two-wheeled traffic into protected roundabouts manages all those crossing into a gentle flow of traffic. “Just because you’re on a bike doesn’t mean you don’t want to go where people who are walking want to go,” says Skip Graffam, a landscape architect at the Olin Studio and one of the designers of Apple Inc.’s new campus in Cupertino, Calif. “The trick is to slow the faster-moving traffic down and avoid creating spaces where anyone is blindsided or moving too fast to change their direction.” Pedestrians are separated from riders, and riders can be separated from car traffic with physical barriers or, more dramatically, by being elevated above them, as is the case at the Hovenring in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. Overnight Truck Deliveries The presence of delivery trucks double-parking or occupying space in bike or scooter lanes is a major contributor to urban congestion (or, worse, collisions). Creating a policy that gives trucks an incentive to make their deliveries during off-peak hours has been tried in cities from New York to Stockholm, and the results are promising. “You get a lot of complaining from the truck companies and their customers at first,” says Jon Orcutt of TransitCenter, a foundation that promotes public transit options in cities. “But they soon realize that overnight deliveries benefit them: There’s less traffic overnight, so shipments can be made more quickly and efficiently.” In cities where off-peak deliveries have been tried, officials can design tax incentives for businesses to help offset any costs associated with overtime pay. More important, rush hour and daytime traffic is radically reduced, as some of the biggest causes of it have converted to a nocturnal schedule. Two-Wheeled Parking The great fear of adding dockless scooters and bikes to an urban transitscape is the potential for sidewalk clutter with all the unused equipment left willy-nilly on the sidewalk. “It’s a lot like strollers at a theme-park attraction,” says Paul Daurio, who oversaw the creation of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando and worked on various Disney parks. “You have to create a space for them, or else they’ll crowd your public spaces.” But take one automotive parking space, and you can create room to park a dozen or more two-wheeled vehicles. Using location technologies like GPS and Bluetooth, a scooter or bike provider could know if you’ve left your ride at the right spot, and reward you for good behavior: “Park in the right spot 10 times in a row, and your next ride’s on us!” Multiple Bike and Scooter Lanes If the future of urban transportation places less emphasis on cars, then the amount of space that car lanes need will decrease. “There are literally millions of square feet trapped between the lanes of cities,” Sadik-Khan says. Safety is enhanced when bikes and scooters are not only physically separated from cars and pedestrians, but also when higher-speed traffic is separated from slower-moving riders. Just as highways have express and local lanes, city streets should recognize that people move at different speeds. Riders who have farther to go and will maintain a faster speed shouldn’t share a narrow roadway with tourists who may stop on a dime to snap a selfie. “You have to think of building a completely different kind of street—a street that’s safer for everyone on it, whether you’re a pedestrian, a cyclist, or a driver,” Sadik-Khan says. A Return to Older Urban Design Renaissance cities are basically car-proof: Narrow streets and sharp turns make them inhospitable to four-wheeled traffic. But they’re ideal for human beings and smaller modes of transport. “The idea of parking outside a city center and then walking or riding that last mile is something we should reconsider,” Daurio says. “You walk through those older cities and see how everything is scaled to the person, not the car.” Even comparatively modern cities have histories worth exploring. “Look at those early-20th-century films of streets like in San Francisco. Before cars took over, the street was a mix of people, carts, and bikes,” Graffam says. “The street was a public space.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/five-ways-to-redesign-cities-for-the-scooter-era
"Toppled scooters, sidewalk riding, and illegal parking: Electric scooters have returned to San Francisco after being banned",Business Insider,,National,2018,10,16,"Toppled scooters, sidewalk riding, and illegal parking: Electric scooters have returned to San Francisco after being banned. In May 2018, San Francisco instated a temporary ban on electric scooters after residents complained of congested streets and illegal parking. The city has since allowed two scooter rental services — Scoot Networks and Skip — to participate in a yearlong pilot program, which launched on October 15th. Within hours of the launch, the companies witnessed a host of illegal behavior, such as residents toppling over scooters or riding along the sidewalks. The day after San Francisco lifted its temporary ban on electric scooters, residents have already taken to knocking them over, parking illegally, and riding on sidewalks instead of bike lanes. The incidents are further proof of the difficulties surrounding the new form of transportation, which first appeared on the city's streets in March. In an overnight avalanche, three companies — Bird, LimeBikes, and Spin — began deploying their electric scooters in San Francisco to the chagrin of local residents. From April 11th to May 23rd, the city received nearly 1,900 complaints about the new vehicles, many of which hailed from techies themselves. ""A few weeks ago, I had not noticed any electric scooters in SF. Now you can’t exit a building without tripping over one,"" M.G. Siegler, a general partner at Google's investment arm, GV, tweeted in April. Part of the problem was that the dockless systems had allowed for scooters to be discarded along the streets. This created a hazard for residents, who found their sidewalks clogged and their building entrances blockaded with a mass of vehicles. The city sprung into action, demanding that the three scooter companies suspend their operations until they were awarded a permit. The companies, which did not seek permission before deploying their programs, were then asked to submit a business plan for ensuring riders' safety and keeping sidewalks clear. They were soon joined by nine other applicants, including Uber and Lyft. In the end, San Francisco showed little mercy to companies with which it had previously clashed. In August, the city awarded permits to two scooter companies that had not yet deployed their services: Scoot Networks and Skip. Each company will start off with 625 scooters as part of a yearlong pilot program. The announcement prompted LimeBikes to file a lawsuit against the city over ""bias and favoritism."" Despite their initial complaints, many residents were eager for scooters to return. Though a nuisance to pedestrians, the vehicles have allowed for easy transportation through an otherwise crowded city. Many San Franciscans have also found scooters to be faster and more affordable than car-sharing services. But the October 15th launch called to mind many of the problems that the city had endured with Bird, LimeBikes, and Spin. Early that morning, a man was spotted toppling the scooters one by one near the Financial District. The scooters were stationed illegally outside a bus stop, preventing some passengers from exiting at their destination. While both Scoot and Skip have devised systems for flagging unlawful activity, they'll have to prove that these systems work before securing a permanent spot on the city's streets.",https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-scooters-return-to-san-francisco-after-a-citywide-ban-2018-10
"Scooter companies, seeking to shape regulations, hire transit advocates",Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,10,17,"Scooter companies, seeking to shape regulations, hire transit advocates. As micromobility services expand, startups seek public sector transit experience. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, who helped spearhead federal autonomous vehicle regulations and the Smart City Challenge, would be a good get for any aspiring transit startup. In a recent Medium post announcing his new job as chief policy officer at Lyft, Foxx demonstrated why, as he discussed technology’s potential to transform how we get around, as well as the power of transit to change the lives of everyday Americans. “How much more discretionary money might my family have had if we never owned a car—if there had been a way to pay for the trips they needed instead of the car itself?” he wrote, explaining how his own family could have benefitted from a more affordable way to get around their hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Foxx’s move comes at an important junction for Lyft, which is making a big push to promote more sustainable and multimodal transit, having recently purchased the nation’s biggest bike share operator and expanded its fleet to include scooters and e-bikes. Lyft’s shift comes during an equally transformative moment for micromobility in general. As scooter startups like Bird and Lime, valued in the billions, continue to expand, and established ridehailing firms like Uber and Lyft introduce their own scooter options, the growth imperatives of venture capital will continue to butt up against local governments. So, transit startups are looking for employees with government and nonprofit experience to help work with cities and shape policy. Turns out regulations need to be followed This strategy of hiring former public policy experts to help a private firm shape legislation and regulation is, of course, not a new one. This new generation of transit companies is poaching employees from Uber and Lyft. But with cities becoming more experienced with transit technology after Uber and Lyft’s early and unfettered growth, and local governments pushing back against the proliferation of dockless electric scooters with bans and regulations, especially in places such as Santa Monica and San Francisco, there’s a larger incentive for startups to hire talent with government experience. With companies like Airbnb and Uber consistently engaged in battles with local regulators, the tide may have turned for Big Tech. As transit analyst and Populus.AI founder Regina Clewlow wrote, “many companies, big and small, are starting to learn that cities could play a huge role in determining who the winners and losers will be in the race for the future of mobility.” In addition to Foxx, other recent high-profile hires include Paul Steely White, former executive director of New York’s Transportation Alternatives, who was recently hired by Bird. He sees the rise in micromobility as a means to build a bigger coalition behind transit reform, shared streets, and pedestrian safety. “The common cause that cyclists, walkers, and new forms of small mobility have [means] there’s clearly a big-tent moment,” White told Curbed New York, “where there’s an opportunity to organize all these smart alternatives to cars into a more unified political force for change.” As these companies continue to market themselves as sustainable, it’s an encouraging sign they’re hiring experts who have been fighting for car-free transit for years. Many of these companies have made proposals suggesting they want to put some of their significant bankroll behind car-free transit. Uber announced that they plan to spend $10 million over three years as part of a Fund for Sustainable Mobility to support campaigns for safety and improved transit, and Bird announced plans to fund protected bike lanes, announcing it would set aside $1 a day per scooter to repair and expanded infrastructure. But, at the end of the day, will companies ever truly place the public good, and public control of shared transit infrastructure, above private gains? As Streetsblog notes, there are many goals, such as safety, speed reduction, and equity, where advocates need to stand firm against backsliding or wavering by corporations trying to mix a progressive message with the profit motive.",https://www.curbed.com/2018/10/17/17990972/transportation-scooters-bird-lime-government-policy
Class-action lawsuit accuses e-scooter companies of ‘gross negligence’,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,10,20,"Class-action lawsuit accuses e-scooter companies of ‘gross negligence’. The nation’s electronic-scooter companies are facing more blowback as concerns rise about the safety of these devices — this time in the form of a class-action lawsuit filed Friday in California. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses two of the largest e-scooter companies, Lime and Bird, as well as other e-scooter firms, of “gross negligence” and “aiding and abetting assault.” The lawsuit, filed on behalf of eight initial plaintiffs, says the companies' practices have contributed to injuries in multiple ways. By “dumping” scooters on public streets without an appropriate warning, the suit alleges e-scooter companies acted negligently and should have known that their devices would become a dangerous “public nuisance.” Three plaintiffs claim they were walking when e-scooter riders crashed into them from behind, resulting in severe injuries. The suit alleges that e-scooter companies knew their riders were injuring pedestrians and –– by failing to stop the collisions from occurring –– assisted and encouraged scooter riders as they committed “assaults.” The suit also states that both companies' scooters contain defective electronics and mechanical parts, as well inadequate safety instructions for riders and that they have “a wanton disregard for the safety of others.” The risks posed by the devices, the suit states, “were known and/or knowable” based on “professional knowledge” known within the transportation community. The suit makes numerous claims about scooters' mechanical issues, but does not provide concrete evidence for those claims. The suit also names scooter manufacturers Xiaomi United States and Segway as defendants. “While acting under the guise of the commendable goals of furthering personal freedom and mobility and protecting the environment, the Defendants, and each of them, are endangering the health, safety and welfare of riders, pedestrians and the general public,” the suit states. The suit adds that “scores (if not hundreds) of riders and pedestrians and members of the public have suffered, are continuing to suffer and will to continue to suffer egregious and avoidable injuries and damage to their person and property.” Spokespersons for Segway and Xiaomi United States did not respond to a request for comment. A Lime spokesperson said the company is in the process of reviewing the complaint. “While we don’t comment on pending litigation, safety has always been at the very core of everything we do at Lime –– as is our mission of reducing cars from city streets and making them safer and greener for pedestrians, bike and scooter riders alike,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company “prides itself on taking proactive steps relating safety wherever we have a presence."" In a statement released by Bird, the company pointed out that the complaint has been brought “against the entire e-scooter industry"" and said shared e-scooters have become an important transportation mode “for hundreds of thousands of people in 100 cities worldwide.” “We believe that the climate crisis and our car dependency demand a transportation mode shift, and clean energy vehicles like e-scooters are already replacing millions of short car trips,” the statement said. “There is no evidence that riding an e-scooter presents a greater level of danger to riders than riding a bike. Cars remain the greatest threat to commuters, killing over 40,000 people in the US yearly.” Since their sudden arrival in recent months, e-scooters have been linked to an uptick in severe injuries in hospitals around the country, according to emergency-room physicians. As the value and popularity of companies such as Bird and Lime have soared, a growing number of critics –– including doctors, former riders and scooter mechanics –– claim that e-scooter fleets are poorly maintained and prone to dangerous mechanical failures. Two e-scooter riders –– one in Dallas and another in the District –– have been involved in accidents that led to their deaths, authorities say. The class-action suit adds a new category of people to the list of those fiercely opposed to the latest form of controversial transportation sweeping the country: pedestrians. Among the plaintiffs is David Petersen, a 62-year-old street performer known as “Davy Rocks,” who alleges that he was severely injured after being struck by an e-scooter rider in June. Dancing for onlookers near the Santa Monica pier in California, Petersen, clad in his trademark “gladiator outfit,” told The Washington Post that he was hit from behind by a man on a Bird scooter; the man fled the scene. Petersen said the force of the collision knocked him down, but he managed to lessen the impact by catching himself with his right hand. Had he been an elderly person or a small child, he said, he could’ve been killed. Petersen said he suffered a fractured arm and a severed biceps, an injury that caused him to miss weeks of work. The muscle had to be surgically reattached using a cadaver graft, he said. “My arm is never going to be the same, not to mention the five-inch-long scar it’s got now,” he said, noting that his arm has lost rotation and feels stiff. “If Bird is going to profit off the human meat grinder they’ve created in Santa Monica, they should be held responsible for the suffering they’ve caused.” Additionally, the lawsuit accuses Bird and Lime of multiple breaches of each company’s warranty and alleges that their vehicles were “not suitable” for repeated use in public places. Stating that the deployment of e-scooters is unlawful, the suit claims that each company should be prohibited from continuing to deploy scooters in California. Beyond seeking damages, the suit claims that scooter companies should be required to include “adequate warnings and/or instructions” to their apps and vehicles. Catherine Lerer –– a personal-injury lawyer from Santa Monica who is representing the plaintiffs with lawyer Jeffrey Lee Costell –– said she has received more than 100 calls from people injured by scooters in recent months. Whether they involve riders or pedestrians, she said, the injuries are consistent: broken noses, legs, arms, wrists, hands and ribs, as well as head injuries and tears to anterior cruciate ligaments and rotator cuffs that require surgery. “We filed this class-action lawsuit against Bird and Lime and the manufacturers of their electric scooters to address the terrible injuries they have inflicted on their riders and pedestrians, and the continuing harm they are causing,” Lerer said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/20/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-e-scooter-companies-gross-negligence/
Skip Scooters Get a Latch So They Don’t Junk up the Sidewalks,Wired,,National,2018,10,20,"Skip Scooters Get a Latch So They Don’t Junk up the Sidewalks. It’s an engineering fix designed to make the vehicles more attractive to officials and regulators. A scooter nightmare for cities might look something like this: Thousands of unused, rickety twists of metal and tire, sprawled across sidewalks. No walking, no wheeling: Just private companies’ private property, littered across public space. Of course, no American city really looks like that, even though the scooter-share craze has reached well over two dozen major urban places. And many do want scooter-share to work: Scooters might be a tool in the fight against car traffic, emissions, and sedentary lifestyles. But how to get the mobility without the mess? Well, today, San Francisco-based Skip Scooters rolls out a new feature. The addition, to be honest, doesn’t look like much: a retractable, 28.7-inch, high-strength steel wire, covered in a protective vinyl wrapping. At the end is a latch. Pull the steel wire out of the new, bright blue casing that surrounds the scooter’s stem, loop it around a bike rack, and click it back into the side of the scooter. Et voila: A purpose-built tool to keep scooters from tipping over on the street and blocking walkers, wheelchair users, and stroller-pushers. It’s a shiny, steel wire olive branch to the cities that ultimately control the shared scooter industry’s fate. It makes sense that Skip, of all the startups that have spilled onto city sidewalks this past year, would be the first to build in a bike lock–like mechanism that allows riders to secure its shared scooters to a bike rack. The startup has built its brand on two tenets: First, that unlike those who launch first and ask permission from City Hall later, it will work hand in handlebar with local government officials and community groups. And second, that Skip’s custom-designed scooters will be better than everyone else’s. The company says its scooters were designed for sharing from the get-go, with dual suspension, adjustable handlebars, and headlights, taillights, and brake lights. Skip gets its gearhead-y bent from cofounders Sanjay Dastoor and Matt Tran, who also founded Boosted Boards, the electric skateboard company. Those two things—the form of the scooter and the way the company works with governments—are tightly related, says Dastoor, who is also Skip's CEO. “With scooters and bikes with locking mechanisms, you see a different response from how scooters have been received in the past,” he says. “A big part of that is the way you talk to the community, but another part is building technologies like locks that are actually mitigating those problems, and not just assuming they'll go away.” As with models, sumo wrestlers, and airplanes, shape is destiny. The scooters with the tethering feature are slated to be tested during a year-long pilot project in San Francisco. Skip also operates in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC, and is testing in Long Beach, San Jose, and Oakland, California. San Francisco’s Municipal Transportation Agency, which launched an intensive scooter permitting process after ordering all other scooter-share companies off the road in June, emphasized that it had chosen Skip and competitor Scoot out of a field of 12 in part because both startups had promised to run services with tethering mechanisms. (Scoot senior marketing and events manager Jasmine Wallsmith says that company should have a lock-to mechanism available on its scooters by the end of the year.) “Thoughtfully designed shared mobility devices help both riders and non-riders, whereas devices strewn carelessly across sidewalks are helpful to no one at all,” says SFMTA spokesperson Ben Jose. Austin also required scooters to come with lock-to mechanisms for its scooter pilot project, but backed off the requirement by late summer, partly because, well, no one had built them yet. Chicago and Washington, DC, currently require dockless bicycle companies to provide locking devices, and users to secure their rides to bike racks or streets signs when they end their trips. Skip is betting that officials in other cities will be attracted to its new feature, especially as more roll out official scooter pilot programs with stricter rules. Not all scooter and bike startups are sold on the lock-to stuff, though. They argue that there aren’t enough racks to support the explosion of scooter- and bike-share companies, and that riders might lock the scoots to something they shouldn’t—a staircase rail, an emergency sign, scaffolding—and block street access. “The benefit of not lock-to is that it makes scooters truly flexible,” says Lime CEO Toby Sun. (He says Lime does “have the capability” of offering scooters with lock-to devices for very small fleets.) Like vehicles from competitors Skip, and Lyft, Lime’s come with built-in sensors that can alert the company when one of its bikes or scoots has tipped over. (Bird has also said its implementing this tech.) The companies can then dispatch workers to right them. But Jose, from the SFMTA, says the city hasn’t had trouble with vehicles locked in the wrong places so far, even after 10 months of a dockless shared bicycle pilot with the Uber-owned e-bike service Jump. For now, Skip plans to keep testing and refining its locks. And burnishing its image as the nice guy of the scooter industry. It wants to launch a community advisory board, which will advise the startup on service issues. And it has placed the number for its hotline, staffed 24/7, on each of its vehicles, so even non-users can call to complain. “We actually want to hear from people who say this isn't working, so that we can address that with better training or better technology,” says Dastoor. Because wouldn’t it be nice if everybody could be friends?",https://www.wired.com/story/skip-scooters-latch-dont-junk-up-sidewalk/
"Electric scooters burst into flame due to bad batteries, company says",The Guardian,,National,2018,10,30,"Electric scooters burst into flame due to bad batteries, company says. Lime says manufacturing defect affected tiny percentage of scooters as dockless vehicles spread to cities worldwide. It was a late night in late August when an employee at a Lime scooter facility in Tahoe, heard a loud bang. One of the bright-green rental scooters – which have meteorically swarmed streets in crowded cities around the world over the past year – had burst into flames, seemingly, all on its own. According to a blog posted by Lime on Tuesday, nearly two months later, bad batteries were to blame. Stating that the defect had affected less than 0.01% of the “fleet”, the company conceded that a “manufacturing defect could result in the battery smoldering, or in some cases, catching fire”. It’s the latest controversy over the dockless scooters, that have spread to cities across the globe in recent years. The Washington Post, which first reported the story, found that employees had alerted the company to potential issues and felt they had not been adequately addressed, putting riders and “juicers”, people paid to charge the scooters overnight, at unnecessary risk. Since starting just over a year ago, Lime boasts it has millions of riders. The company emphasized in its response that it has taken extra precautions to ensure the safety of anyone who uses or charges its scooters. Writing that the batteries were manufactured by Segway Ninebot, a company merged from a Chinese company and an American one that produces transportation products, Lime stated it had created software to detect any that were defective. Then, it made a second software program to find all the Scooters that might have one, bringing them all home to local headquarters. “When an affected battery was identified – with a red code – we promptly deactivated the scooter so that no members of the public could ride or charge it,” the company wrote in the statement. Reiterating that it did not want to take any chances, it also will now have employees familiar with the issue on hand for 24 hours a day at facilities where the Segway Ninebot Scooters are held and will run daily diagnostics on all scooters, regardless of where they were made and if they might have rogue batteries. But according to Lime mechanics, who spoke anonymously to the Post, their concerns over the scooters were dismissed by senior staff, especially over the safety of “juicers” who may have unknowingly charged machines with potentially dangerous defects. “These people are plugging these scooters into their house at night and going to sleep thinking they’re safe and that they just earned an easy $15,” one employee told the Post. “When I asked my managers if we were going to tell them all I got was shrugged shoulders and ‘I don’t know’.” Others voiced frustrations in their mechanic Slack chat, calling for the company to remove the scooters from the market until the issues were better addressed. “I get that the scoots are expendable and replaceable,” one person wrote. “But are we now resigned to say the same for the safety of employees and customers?” This isn’t the first safety issue raised, as scooter companies have rapidly descended on cities around the world. Seen as either the scourge or saviors in crowded cities, where cheap, efficient transportation is scarce, proponents have argued for their use as a sustainable solution, while critics point out the dangers. Scooter-caused emergency-room visits are becoming increasingly common, and there have been allegations that the proper upkeep has not been done by startup scooter companies. In cities like San Francisco, the response was swift, and scooters that did not end up in trashcans or in local lakes were taken off the streets by regulatory officials, before they were brought back in smaller doses. Other cities are working to create better scooter rules, as scooter startups continue to increase their scale. Lime disputes any questions over its intentions, and emphasized safety is of utmost importance. “Lime takes full responsibility for our scooters,” it wrote. “The safety of our riders, Juicers, and community is our highest priority, and we will continue to hold our equipment manufacturers and ourselves to the highest possible standard.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/30/lime-electric-scooters-catch-fire-bad-batteries
"Electric Scooters Are “Smoldering,” and Not in a Good Way",Slate,,National,2018,10,31,"Electric Scooters Are “Smoldering,” and Not in a Good Way. They join a long line of consumer products with problems related to battery fires. In recent months, the market for electric scooters has caught fire—and so, apparently, have some electric scooter batteries. On Tuesday, electric scooter company Lime announced that a manufacturing defect, in “several isolated instances,” could cause batteries on its vehicles to smolder, or even, in some cases, catch flames. The announcement came after questions from the Washington Post on the fire risk surrounding some scooters—a risk that the company, according to its statement, first identified in August. In an interview with the Washington Post, Lime officials said they recalled about 2,000 scooters and that only a very small portion of those recalled scooters presented any real threat of fire or smoldering. According to the Washington Post, the only known case of a scooter fire occurred at a Lime facility in Lake Tahoe in late August. In its statement, the company said its removal of scooters affected riders and chargers in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Lake Tahoe, California, but that “at no time were riders or members of the public put at risk.” According to the company, the defect arose in one of the two types of batteries used in early scooter models. The scooters with defective batteries were manufactured by Segway Ninebot. Lime said it also recently received an unconfirmed report about the risk of “battery failure” in a different Ninebot scooter model—and as a result, all Segway Ninebot scooters will now be charged in the company’s storage facilities (rather than in people’s homes) until it “is satisfied that there are no remaining issues.” The “vast majority” of scooters on the streets are later models, the company said, which come from manufacturers other than Segway Ninebot. Bird, another leading scooter company, also uses a variety of manufacturers for its vehicles, and that list includes Segway Ninebot. In a statement to Slate on Wednesday, Bird said it had reached out to the manufacturing company to confirm that its own scooters were free from the defects reported in Lime’s early model vehicles. “We have conducted our own initial investigation of the reported claims and believe that none of the vehicles Bird purchased from Segway Ninebot are affected,” a spokesperson wrote. The Washington Post’s report includes interviews with Lime employees who raised concerns over scooter safety. In an internal Slack message in a chatroom for mechanics, one employee apparently wrote, “I get that the scoots are expendable and replaceable, but are we now resigned to say the same for the safety of employees and customers?” These most recent concerns over battery safety in electric scooters fall into line with a long, would-be-entertaining-if-it-wasn’t-so-scary history of batteries with literal explosive potential. Unforgettably, there was the 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 dilemma, which included a Florida man’s Jeep catching fire post phone-explosion, a Southwest Airlines flight evacuation after a “popping and smoking” phone incident, and Samsung’s eventual decision to stop production of the phone in what Reuters called “one of the costliest product safety failures in tech history.” In 2015, hoverboards also made headlines for catching fire. Two years later, a hoverboard fire reportedly lead to the death of a 3-year-old girl. In 2016, CNET defined hoverboards as a “form of transportation that lets trendy kids get into trouble while effortlessly zipping along the sidewalk”—a description that, a couple years later, seems like it could be just as accurately applied to scooters. The list of examples of battery fires goes on: electric cars (think Tesla), notebook computers (hello, Dell), baby monitors (yes, baby monitors!). Most of the danger lies in lithium ion batteries, ubiquitous in consumer devices thanks to their long run time and seamless rechargeability. In the vast, vast majority of cases, we don’t notice these batteries, and they serve us nobly. As Matthew Eisler wrote for Slate in 2016, “the technology is largely out of sight and out of mind, and it does not get the credit it deserves as an enabler of the mobile computing revolution.” But when things go wrong, they can go really wrong. That is, when “the lithium genie gets out of the bottle,” Eisler writes, there are “potentially catastrophic consequences.” The principal federal agency in charge of reducing that potential and dealing with those consequences is the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But, unfortunately, the CPSC is a largely reactive agency. As NPR explained in 2016, the CPSC “does not approve products before they go to market, like the FDA. Its strongest power is the law that requires all companies to report known hazards in their products to the CPSC immediately.” In the interim, we put our trust in the companies that connect us, power us, and scoot us. The good news with the Lime battery problems is that the company says they impacted less than 0.01 percent of its scooter fleet, and no one was hurt. And the revelations, it seems, might serve as a lesson on critically examining safety features in scooters and other battery-powered consumer products—an opportunity, if you will, to make limeade out of Lime.",https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/lime-electric-scooters-battery-fire-risk.html
Report: Texas man charged with DUI after scooter crash,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,11,1,"Report: Texas man charged with DUI after scooter crash. A new trend to the trend? Police in Texas charged a 30-year-old man with driving while intoxicated after he crashed a scooter outside a restaurant on Halloween, the Austin American-Statesman reported Thursday. It wasn’t Travis Walker’s first DUI, either, according to the report. The paper says he has two prior convictions — presumably with vehicles other than the gas-powered Viza Viper he was scooting around on until the crash Wednesday evening. Walker was going to try to make his getaway, bloody elbows and all, when restaurant staff called the cops, the Statesman says, citing the police affidavit. Walker was offered a taxi ride and — new mistake — refused. “As he was leaving, Walker fell off the scooter and almost crashed into a taxicab,” the report says. “Police performed field sobriety tests on Walker, who told officers he thought it was 3:32 a.m. when it was 8:13 p.m., and was laughing.” Alas, this is not a first in any way. That distinction could belong to Nicholas Kauffroath, 28, who in September became the first scooter jockey to sustain a DUI conviction in Los Angeles, USA Today reported. He was allegedly three times over the legal limit when he crashed a Bird scooter into a 64-year-old pedestrian, the Associated Press reported. On Sept. 28, he pleaded no contest to hit-and-run and operating a motorized scooter while under the influence of alcohol and received a $550 fine, plus probation. He also had to pay restitution.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2018/11/01/report-texas-man-charged-with-dui-after-scooter-crash/
Elon Musk says electric scooters “lack dignity”,Vox,Vox,National,2018,11,2,"Elon Musk says electric scooters “lack dignity”. His dismissal of scooters is odd, considering he wants the future of transportation to be electrified. Elon Musk owns two companies — SpaceX and Tesla — that build rocket ships and electric cars, respectively. He dreams of connecting cities via hyperloop tubes. But there’s at least one emerging form of transportation he’s not fond of. The electric scooter, he said on a new Recode Decode podcast with Kara Swisher, “lacks dignity.” When Swisher pushed back, saying she rides them and looks fantastic doing so, he responded, “You are laboring under an illusion.” His dislike of e-scooters is odd, considering how strongly he believes transportation should be electrified. Tesla’s success is “very important for the future of the world,” he told Swisher. “It’s very important for all life on Earth. This supersedes political parties, race, creed, religion, it doesn’t matter. If we do not solve the environment, we’re all damned.” It’s true that scooters — which have rapidly appeared in many American cities thanks to companies like Lime, Bird, Skip, Scoot, and Spin — can be an eyesore. They clutter sidewalks and get in the way of pedestrians. But as Umair Irfan has explained for Vox, scooters, while inelegant to some, do fill in an important gap in our transit system. And, in some cases, they reduce the need for fossil fuels. They run on electricity, they’re better for the climate than cars. What’s more dignified than that? “If you’re scooting instead of walking, then the ride has [an] ... environmental cost,” Irfan wrote. “But if you’re replacing a car ride, then it has an environmental benefit since an electric scooter uses a tiny fraction of the energy consumed by a car.” Most vehicle trips are less than six miles long, the US Department of Energy finds. If we could replace more of those short rides with transport on electric vehicles, like scooters, we could potentially burn less fossil fuels. Also overlooked: Scooters bring cheap transportation to areas that lack access to subway lines. People who make under $50,000 a year, tend to view the scooters more favorably than others, the mobility platform Populus finds. In the interview with Swisher, Musk says he prefers electric bicycles. “Electric bike, I think we might do an electric bike, yeah,” he says. But favoring bicycles overlooks a key draw of the scooters: You don’t have to expend much effort to ride them. As Vox’s Matthew Yglesias writes: the electric scooter works considerably better than a bicycle. For starters, you don’t need to do the actual work of pedaling a bicycle. It’s a lazier, rather than less lazy, alternative to walking, which makes it more competitive with the dominant car-commuting lifestyle in the United States. That also makes it a lot friendlier to people who’d like to move about the city in business attire without showing up for meetings covered in sweat. On a hot, sweaty day a scooter will help a person get to their job interview without as much back sweat.

Milking Scooters for Cash Helps Cities Build for the Future,Wired,,National,2018,11,6,"Milking Scooters for Cash Helps Cities Build for the Future. Cities are experimenting with fees for scooter companies desperate to leave their electric mobiles on their sidewalks. And that money could help them keep up with the evolving world of mobility. They have landed in San Francisco, San Diego, Minneapolis. They have squeezed into Charlotte, North Carolina, Miami, and Phoenix. As shared, electric scooters took off some local governments panicked. Others moralized. A few shrugged their shoulders and let the people ride. But almost all of them whipped out the calculators. A shared scooter service doesn’t work if its users can’t park the vehicles on public sidewalks. And it turns out that sidewalks aren’t free. In Austin, officials are charging companies $100 a bike or scooter during its experimental phase, and could raise tens of thousands annually. Mobility startups operating in Santa Monica, California, have shelled out a $20,000 each for the right to operate, plus $130 per each device on the street, plus $1 per device per day for the privilege of parking on the public sidewalk. (That last charge is modeled off the way the city charges restaurants for outdoor dining.) Participants’ in Los Angeles’ soon-to-launch scooter and bike program will have a similar setup. Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, is charging the companies operating there a 25-cent per trip fee. Cities insist this is not a bid to squeeze cash-rich companies for easy money. It’s the cost of doing business. In most places, the money goes to administering the program. City staff put real time into collecting data, purchasing software to crunch it, evaluating whether scooters and bikes actually helping people get around, and yes, impounding the ones that get in the way. San Francisco, for example, requires each of its two permitted e-scooter-share companies to pay $25,000 for an annual permit, plus $10,000 to an endowment fund for city property repair and maintenance. Some officials, though, have added in something extra. A sprinkle of funding demands on top of the raw cost of handling scooters. And this model—charging fees per scooter to private companies that use public roads—just might be a template for other kinds of vehicles. Vehicles operated by companies like Uber and Lyft, maybe, who are now being charged per-trip taxes in places like Washington, DC, and New York City. Or private cars. Or maybe, someday, autonomous vehicles. Seattle, the grand dame of dockless vehicle programs, is one of the places experimenting with those extra fees. Each dockless bike company operating in the city has to cough up about $50 per bike. More than half of those dollars go to administration. The rest goes to building infrastructure like protected bike lanes and bike racks. (If the city decides to allow scooters, it could use the funds to build dedicated parking “corrals” for them.) That means the mobility companies help pay for the street improvements that make their products easier and safer to use. Plenty of other cities are using bike and scooter fees to fund bike scooter infrastructure—and to target specific neighborhoods that need help. Lawmakers in Indianapolis just voted to dedicate some of its scooter fees to improving street design. Portland, Oregon’s doing it too. And LA will lower its per-bike or -scooter fee by $91 for those deployed in areas disproportionately affected by pollution. “I would certainly advise cities to think very carefully about the types of fees they impose on bikes and scooters, and make sure they don’t miss an opportunity to adequately manage mobility in their cities,” says Andrew Glass Hastings, who helped write Seattle’s rules as the former director of transit and mobility in the city’s department of transportation. (Hastings is currently a senior mobility strategist at the company Remix, which builds planning and analytics software for cities.)1 Get WIRED Access Subscribe Most Popular Image may contain: Electronics Gear Amazon Prime Day 2020: The 60 Absolute Best Tech Deals (Day 2) Gear Team Image may contain: Cell Phone, Electronics, Mobile Phone, and Phone Gear The Triumphant Return of the Good Small Phone Brian Barrett Image may contain: Adapter, and Plug Gear The iPhone 12 Ships Without a Charger.

A way to connect far-flung residential areas to public transportation? A strategy to give traveling options to neighborhoods and communities with too few? Just an entertaining, recreational thing that people should be able to do safely? The answers will influence how to spend that money. Here’s the (possibly) fun part: “What you’re seeing with bikes and scooters is setting the stage for what is to come with autonomous vehicles,” Hastings says. Expect cities to continue to want to charge those automated vehicle companies fees to use the public street to make money, and to guide transit toward underserved communities, and maybe even to meet their climate goals. Expect a debate to ensue. But also expect some savvy officials to come into the conversation with companies knowing exactly what they want to extract from them—and how much to charge. As former Uber and Google strategist Anne Widera pointed out in Axios last month, “cities will shape the future business potential of AVs.” This will be particularly important if shared, autonomous vehicles truly do cut down on parking fees and speeding tickets, which provide valuable revenue streams for many governments. Some, including scooter companies themselves, are more skeptical. The problem with charging them is that other road players aren’t necessarily paying the same thing. “I do think there are benefits to operators, if we have better and safer infrastructure for micromobility,” says Regina Clewlow, CEO and founder of the transportation data and analytics startup Populus.ai. “But I think there are other sources of revenue we should be tapping.” She pauses. “Like charging vehicles.” This is an argument that scooter and bike companies like to make, too. “Lime supports the assessment of reasonable fees to support our city partners in covering the costs of administering and enforcing bike and scooter permit programs,” Emily Warren, Lime’s senior director of policy and public affairs, said in a statement. “Currently, our transportation system tends to let cars off the hook by not charging them for their use of public space or contributions to congestion and emissions.” Indeed, cars and trucks are responsible for a fifth of the nation’s carbon emissions. Why, critics wonder, would cities make it harder to scoot than to drive? So governments muddle through, peeking at each others’ programs to see what the other kids are doing. Kansas City, Missouri, passed an emergency ordinance over the summer that allowed Bird and Lime to operate there, but it’s still hammering away at a more permanent pilot program. Officials are trying to figure out what its goals are—What can scooters do for us?—and what it would like from the companies operating there. Some city council members have suggested using more than $300,000 a year in scooter fees to support affordable housing in the area. “We’re researching what other cities are doing, and working through different cost scenarios,” says Chris Hernandez, director of communications for the Kansas City. “We’ve always been a city that welcomes the entrepreneurial spirit and the tech scene.” And as any well-trained guest knows, it’s always nice to come bearing gifts.",https://www.wired.com/story/scooters-cities-fees-mobility/
Lime issues global recall of one of its electric scooter models amid fears that it can break apart in use,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,11,10,"Lime issues global recall of one of its electric scooter models amid fears that it can break apart in use. The fast-growing electric-scooter company Lime has decided to immediately remove one of its models from every city across the globe after determining that it could break apart while in use. The decision to suddenly pull the scooters off the streets came several weeks after the company said the same model occasionally breaks apart “when subjected to repeated abuse.” But on Friday — in response to questions from The Washington Post about the scooters breaking apart under the strains of normal riding conditions — Lime said it was “looking into reports that scooters manufactured by Okai may break and [that it is] working cooperatively with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the relevant authorities internationally to get to the bottom of this.” Okai is a Chinese manufacturer whose products include scooters. No one could be reached at an email address or a telephone number listed on its website — or at a telephone number provided by Lime. Lime said it would decommission all Okai scooters in use in its fleets, but company officials said that determining the precise number of scooters affected by the recall was difficult and declined to provide an estimate. They also declined to say in how many U.S. cities the scooter model is in use. Riders across the country regularly report on social media that they’ve seen Lime scooters broken in two, often where the baseboard meets the stem. ""Safety is Lime’s highest priority,” the company said in a statement. “The vast majority of Lime’s fleet is manufactured by other companies and decommissioned Okai scooters are being replaced with newer, more advanced scooters considered best in class for safety. We don’t anticipate any real service disruptions.” The mass removal comes several weeks after Lime — one of the nation’s largest scooter companies — acknowledged that it had pulled thousands of its scooters off the streets this summer after discovering that a small number of them may have been carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire. Those scooters were made by the mobility company Segway, which pushed back against Lime’s claims that a manufacturing defect made the scooters vulnerable to catching fire. Some Lime employees, riders and other affiliated individuals say they worry the company may not have moved fast enough to address concerns about the scooters breaking apart. An independent contractor who charges Lime scooters overnight, known as a juicer, provided copies of emails showing that he had warned the company about the problem of scooters breaking as early as September. The juicer, a man in his 40s named Ted, asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution. He said that a few weeks after he began working for Lime in July, he began noticing cracks in scooter baseboards and broken scooters on the street. He estimated that he found baseboard cracks in about 20 percent of the scooters he picked up to charge. Eventually, he highlighted the issue in a lengthy Reddit post that included multiple photos of broken scooters. In an email dated Sept. 8 and addressed to Lime support, Ted warned Lime about four scooters with “cracks on the underside of the deck,” which he labeled a “systematic issue.” He included photos and an identification code for each device. Ted also asked about his payments for recharging the devices. A Lime employee responded to his email but did not address the scooter defects. “Thanks for your email and our apologies for the challenge,” the employee wrote, referring to a question about payment. “I have submitted your payment to Finance; please allow four to seven days for it to post. The payment will show as a ‘bonus’. We appreciate your patience and understanding.” The message prompted Ted to respond with another plea about safety. “I hope the Lime team takes the issue of the cracking scooter decks seriously,” he wrote. “I have dropped off 3 scooters now at the warehouse that were cracked completely in half, and 4 more that had started to crack. All of them have cracked in the same location.” “I believe this is a design flaw that is beginning to surface,” he added. Ted said Lime did not respond. Lime declined to comment on his account. A Lime mechanic in California, who helps service the devices, said employees at his warehouse performing day-to-day maintenance on the company’s scooters have identified scooters at risk of cracking over the past several months. This employee said managers did not aggressively follow up on those concerns. The mechanic spoke on the condition of anonymity and did not want to identify the city where he works for fear of revealing his identity. The mechanic — who said employees monitored how long scooters remained functional after being deployed on city streets — said cracks could develop in the baseboard within days of a device being placed on the streets. The mechanic provided video of employees performing tests in which Lime scooters break after a few small hops. Later recounting the tests on the company’s Slack messaging system, another mechanic noted to a manager that the device can snap even when the rider weighs as little as 145 pounds, according to images of the discussions provided to The Post. “I would suggest that these are unsafe for public use,” the other mechanic wrote. “It’s only a matter of time before someone is severely injured . . . if not here, somewhere else.” Responding to a message on Slack, a manager said she had “raised concerns” about the breaking scooters and been told that mechanics should continue testing the problematic scooters and “work on re-enforcement techniques.” The manager wrote that she would forward photos of similar techniques that she had “gathered from other markets.” Lime declined to comment on the mechanic’s statements or the Slack exchange. A spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said the agency does not approve products before they reach the market. If a “substantial product hazard” is reported by consumers and verified, the spokesman said, the agency could work with a company to issue a recall. “We are aware of the issue,” a CPSC spokeswoman said. “CPSC is working with the firm to gather information and to protect consumers.” Since Lime launched its scooters in the spring, two people have died while riding the devices, and others have been badly injured, according to authorities. When police located a scooter that Jacoby Stoneking had been riding when he sustained blunt-force head injuries in the early hours of Sept. 1, the device was snapped in half, though few other details about the accident are known, according to police and Lime officials. The 24-year-old east Dallas man died in a hospital the next day. Stoneking’s death resonated with Stephen Williams, 29, a Dallas man who said he was injured when the scooter he was riding snapped in two on a busy city street on Oct. 10, throwing him to the ground chest-first. A week later, Williams said, he is still in pain. Contemplating his accident, Williams — a data analyst at a technology company — remembered details of Stoneking’s accident and wondered whether there was a pattern. He began searching for examples of broken Lime scooters, eventually logging more than 40 instances on social media, in news reports and on Reddit, including six that he personally encountered. Williams included those numbers in a wide-ranging review of e-scooters that he provided to the Texas Department of Transportation in Dallas, as well as to Lime. His verdict: In a city heavily reliant on cars for personal mobility, scooters have great potential to “stitch” the city “back together,” allowing people to travel to nearby neighborhoods without creating more traffic. But, he said, he considers the Lime Okai model unsafe for him to ride. “I feel extremely disappointed, perhaps betrayed, by these devices,” said Williams, who says he refuses to ride another Lime until the company improves scooter safety. “That’s disappointing to me because the utility of these devices is so profound.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/10/electric-scooter-giant-lime-launches-global-recall-one-its-models-amid-fears-scooters-can-break-apart/
Scooters: We answer your questions about this latest transportation trend,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,11,10,"Scooters: We answer your questions about this latest transportation trend. Almost overnight, electric scooters have seemingly become ubiquitous on streets and sidewalks in cities across the United States. From joyriding teens to commuters to tourists, this latest transportation trend has been met with excitement — and dread, from some corners, as confusion abounds over rules for use, whether they are considered motor vehicles and where they can be ridden. And they don’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “The more scooters you put out, the more people use them,” said Dave Estrada, head of government relations and policy at Bird, which only a year ago began a social experiment with a few scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, Calif., and has since expanded to more than 75 markets across seven countries. Love them or hate them, scooters appear to be here to stay, so we will try to answer some of the most common questions we have received about them. They are everywhere, but how did we get here? Companies such as Bird, Skip and Lime were among the first to put scooters on U.S. streets. They followed the frenzy of the dockless bike-share movement that took off in the United States in 2017, with colorful bicycles that could be rented through an app and dropped wherever a trip was completed. Several of those services left after struggling with vandalism, theft and city regulations. Some companies that started with bikes added scooters to their fleets. E-scooters first started to appear last spring in cities across California and quickly expanded. Less than a year later, thousands are available for rent in places stretching from Portland to New York. Where can I find them? Bird and Lime, the two largest providers, are each in more than 75 markets across multiple countries. They cover major markets in the United States, including San Diego, Denver, Dallas, St. Louis, Detroit, Indianapolis, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, Baltimore and Washington. Skip, a much smaller operation, has scooters on the ground in Washington, Portland, San Francisco and Long Beach, Calif. It is also testing the service in San Jose and Oakland, Calif. Lyft recently launched in Denver, Santa Monica and Washington. How are they regulated? Most cities were unprepared for the arrival of scooters and had no regulations in place for them. Several places banned the service altogether, in some cases reacting to the unannounced arrival of dockless scooters and bikes with cease-and-desist orders. Cities continue to struggle with creating rules to govern the services, including establishing where scooters are legal to ride, fleet restrictions, fees, parking and speed requirements. Seattle has banned shared scooters until it can study the situation in other cities. Nashville earlier this year sent Bird a cease-and-desist order accusing the company of using public sidewalks without permission but later approved legislation allowing scooters to return. San Francisco forced scooter companies to shut down but recently reopened its thoroughfares to the industry. In the District, scooters fall under “Personal Mobility Device” rules, which establishes that they are motor vehicles and cannot be ridden by anyone under 16. Where can they be ridden? Most cities allow electric scooters on the road. Like bicycles, they are considered vehicles and can share the road with regular traffic. When on the road, riders must follow traffic laws. But states and cities can have rules that differ, and riders should check the rules of their jurisdictions. Like bicycles, some cities allow scooters to be used on sidewalks, while others do not. California law, for example, prohibits electric scooters on sidewalks. In Denver, scooters are allowed only on sidewalks and prohibited from use in the street. In the District, scooters can be used on sidewalks, except in the central business district, which includes downtown. The same rule applies to bicycles. As a general rule, riders are encouraged to use bike lanes where available or the road. Riding is discouraged on crowded sidewalks, where they can be hazardous to pedestrians. How can I rent one, and how much does it cost? You can find, unlock and pay for a scooter using each company’s app. The apps are available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The apps operate similarly: They provide the location of the scooter closest to you and guide you through the process of renting one. You will need a credit card. Scooters in most cities rent for $1 to start, plus 15 cents a minute. In some cities, it’s 20 cents a minute. Are there requirements for renting and riding a scooter? Most companies require riders to be 18 or older. This stipulation is often printed on the scooter and/or included in the user agreement. Bird and Lime require users to scan their driver’s licenses. Skip uses ID-scanning technology to ensure riders meet the age requirement in most cities. Is there safety protocol and is a helmet required? Most cities don’t require riders to use a helmet, as is the case in Washington, but companies encourage their use. Bird and Skip will mail helmets to users who request them. For safety reasons, only one person is allowed on a scooter at a time. Riders are urged to follow all traffic laws, including signs and signals. Use both hands while riding, and don’t wear headphones so you can pay attention to your surroundings without distraction. How are scooters maintained? The companies are supposed to deploy staff to check the scooters daily, but reports of malfunctions and broken or vandalized equipment are on the rise. Some of the companies have said they are boosting maintenance and hiring mechanics and specialized staff. Bird, for example, recently hired a team called Bird Watchers, which it says scans every scooter, inspects it against a maintenance checklist and is trained to fix problems on the spot. The companies say that they are also working on the deployment of a sturdier scooter made for daily use — a more durable option than the first generation of scooters. How fast can they go? Most companies have set speed limits on their scooters to 15 mph. However, they urge riders to follow local regulations and exercise caution. In the District, new regulations set to go into effect next year will require companies to set a maximum speed limit of 10 mph. What's the battery life? Most shared scooters have a range of up to 30 miles and are designed to last throughout the day. What are the hours of operation? Most scooter companies pick up the scooters at night to recharge and repair if needed and return them to the streets in the morning. Lime says its scooters are available 24/7. They have teams pulling scooters for rebalancing every eight hours. Are they available in all kinds of weather? As winter approaches, scooters may not be widely available in some cities. Companies say they may pull their fleets during severe weather and/or adjust operations. It is expected that scooters will be out of commission during a snowstorm, for example. Company officials say they make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Bird halted operations in cities affected by Hurricanes Florence and Michael. Lime said that in areas with harsh winters where roads are too icy, it sometimes redistributes scooters to warmer regions. Where are you supposed to park them? The key is to park responsibly. Some cities (and companies) are starting to crack down on users who simply dump scooters anywhere when they’re finished. They are also working to create designated parking spaces on sidewalks and curbs for bikes and scooters. Some companies are working on geofencing technology that would prohibit riders from ending trips in areas where they aren’t supposed to leave vehicles. As a general rule, riders should never leave a scooter so that it blocks pedestrian walkways, driveways or building entrances, or at crosswalks or bus and subway stops. Scooters should be parked upright. What else should we expect moving forward? In the months to come, there may be more social debate about scooter decorum, infrastructure to handle personal mobility options and more education campaigns to encourage safe, orderly riding. This fall, Lime is launching a $3 million education and safety campaign that includes ads, community outreach and helmet distribution. Companies and cities will have to do better to educate all road users about how to coexist.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/scooters-we-answer-your-questions-about-this-latest-transportation-trend/2018/11/10/a94b7d94-de03-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html
E-scooters are like Q-Tips,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2018,11,15,"E-scooters are like Q-Tips. In both cases, the products are marketed with explicit warnings about how not to use them, even though everyone knows that’s precisely the way pretty much every customer will use them. For scooter riders here in Santa Monica, it means: Don’t you dare ride on the sidewalk, which is against the law, even though it sometimes feels super unsafe to ride next to cars. Or: Wink-wink, always wear a helmet. Also, the beach bike path is verboten, even though it is the smoothest, most fun, most scenic ride possible. And definitely don’t just dump your scooter in the middle of a busy path or sidewalk. Aw shucks, well, we did warn you. Guess it’s your fault if you land in the ER. I get it. Electric scooters are hard to regulate. They’re different from other popular modes of transit — skateboards, bicycles, motorcycles, cars — so there’s no template for rules or best practices. And how do we retrofit both our laws and our car-centric infrastructure to accommodate such a promising new(ish) technology? Compounding all this, public officials are also somewhat scarred by their experience in the ride-share wars. Not so long ago, companies such as Uber and Lyft appeared and proceeded to ignore existing livery laws — some of which were sensible, some of which were stupid — to gain market share. In the process of turning themselves into billion-dollar-plus “unicorns,” the companies mounted aggressive public-relations campaigns. Persnickety politicians who tried to enforce the law were labeled puppets of Big Taxi, or — worse — Luddites. Faced with this new alien e-species, regulators may fear earning another scarlet “L.” About a year ago, Santa Monica became the first city to fully grapple with the task of regulating scooters. It shows how difficult it is to get the regs right. Developments here followed an arc that will sound familiar to the scores of other cities that have since been inundated. First came giddy media coverage about these whiz-bang devices. They’re cheap and fast! They’re super fun! And they can solve the “last mile” problem of commuting, relieving car congestion and carbon emissions! They might even solve climate change! Second came the furious stories about tangled nests of discarded scooters and, more seriously, injuries to both riders or pedestrians. One gentleman, William Kairala, recalls waking up in the emergency room with a fractured skull and possibly permanent brain damage. “They’re very handy. The problem is: You find a scooter, but you don’t find a helmet,” he said during an interview for a “PBS NewsHour” segment I did on Santa Monica’s experience. “And unfortunately I fell off of one. I wasn’t even going fast.” Third, the backlash: scooters thrown into the ocean or off buildings, set on fire, or desecrated by dogs. Brakes and batteries cut. Furious town halls. Lawsuits. Santa Monica initially fought with the scooter companies, even filing a criminal complaint against one, Bird. Ultimately the city launched a pilot program in September with tighter regulations governing when and where the devices could be used, which companies could operate, and so on. But after another PR campaign, Santa Monica appeared to cave on its original criteria for which firms could participate, and when I interviewed city officials more recently, they took on a more conciliatory tone. So, strikingly, did the vendors themselves, perhaps wary of being banned altogether. Ride-sharing companies had an established, motivated customer base — people frustrated with their local taxi monopoly — willing to fight the regulators on their behalf. Scooter companies don’t really have an equivalent. Which perhaps explains why even Lyft emphasizes just how deferential it’s being in rolling out its scooter business. “Our goal here is to do what’s right, and what’s right in this context is to work closely with the cities, get permits and launch once we have permission,” David Fairbank, Lyft’s bikes and scooters market manager, told me. Why does its scooter-sharing strategy seem so different from its car-sharing one? I asked. “I don’t have a ton of context on that but, yeah, we’re working closely with the governments this time,” he said. Meanwhile, the bad habits that riders developed during the Wild West days remain. Helmet use is still virtually nonexistent. (In January, California will actually stop requiring them following a successful lobbying effort by Bird, though the company still recommends wearing helmets.) Scooters are still on sidewalks, beach paths and other places officially forbidden for safety reasons. It is great that regulators and firms have turned the temperature down a little this time and are trying to develop a workable, safety-minded set of regulations. But only if those regulations actually get enforced.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/e-scooters-are-like-q-tips/2018/11/15/432d8e60-e918-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html
Why Ford Is Getting Into The Scooter Business,NPR,NPR,National,2018,11,16,"Why Ford Is Getting Into The Scooter Business. A big car company is going small. Ford is buying electric scooter company Spin. Ford and Spin won't confirm the price tag, but reports put the purchase price at $100 million and an overall investment from Ford of $200 million. The acquisition, announced last week, marks the first time a carmaker has seriously invested in the bike and scooter-sharing sector, which is typically the realm of tech companies. Automakers are trying to broaden their business — to become ""mobility"" companies rather than just selling cars. ""I would say that Ford is a bit of a standout among the pack"" in that approach, says Valerie Sathe Brugeman, a senior project manager with the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research, who says Ford is unique in pursuing scooters. Spin is a relatively small scooter company — it operates in just 14 markets while rivals Bird and Lime each operate in dozens of cities. With the takeover, Spin is working on expanding to about 100 markets in the next 18 months, according to Spin co-founder Derrick Ko. The way scooter-sharing works is that the electric scooters can be unlocked by downloading an app on a smartphone. They typically cost about $1 to start and 15 cents per minute and max out at around 15 mph. This wasn't Ford's first foray into scooters and bikes. The automaker funded a project at Purdue University that brought 40 scooters to the West Lafayette, Ind., campus. Ford sponsors GoBike, which offers rentals of regular and electric bikes in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ford also sells its own licensed brand electric scooter through a company called Ojo. The scooters go for about $2,200. Ford's move may be the largest, but it's not the first of its kind. Just a couple of weeks ago, General Motors said it was developing two new electric bicycles to go on sale next year. But GM hasn't announced further plans. The reason why traditional car companies are investing in things like scooters, bikes, electric vehicles and even self-driving cars is that there's never been as much competition in getting people from point A to point B in cities. It even has a name: micromobility, a catch-all term for electric scooters and bikes. ""All the automotive companies are looking for ways to manage the future,"" says Bruce Belzowski, the managing director of the Automotive Futures Group and formerly of the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ""In the past, they managed the future by just designing and building vehicles that people really wanted to buy. And now they're confronting a potential future that's different from that."" Belzowski says legacy car companies aren't necessarily counting on being profitable when they throw money at new technologies. But these companies don't want to be left behind. With Spin, Ford will be competing primarily with tech companies. Bird and Lime are the biggest powerhouses in scooters, although they've only been around a year or so. Uber bought the bike-sharing company Jump this year and now offers scooter and bike rentals in addition to cars in certain areas. Uber's rival, Lyft, purchased the bike-share company Motivate. And Lyft also has its own electric scooter rental service in Denver, Santa Monica, Calif., and Washington, D.C. It's hard to keep up with money going in so many different ways. ""It's not like a tree, we're looking at, like, a tangled bush,"" says Ivan Drury, an industry analyst at Edmunds.com. ""It's all getting very intertwined easily."" For its part, Ford says its electric scooter expansion will help ease traffic congestion, free up parking spaces and reduce pollution. The company also says it wants to take advantage of the significant pool of people who travel short distances. Almost 46 percent of Americans' vehicle trips are 3 miles or less, according to the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. ""Spin adds an exciting new offering to Ford's mobility portfolio as we try to help our customers get places more easily, more quickly and less expensively,"" Sunny Madra, the vice president of the company's Ford X division, wrote. ""As more people consider scooters to be a viable mobility option, now is the right time for Ford to work closely with Spin's highly experienced and dedicated team to help expand their service to more cities,"" he added. Another reason fueling Ford's purchase of Spin goes back to the way tech companies make money: collecting personal information, Drury says. ""This is a deal that makes sense because [Ford] will acquire data,"" he says. ""Acquiring and knowing how people are utilizing other modes of transportation in addition to the ones that they already have."" For example, Drury envisions a world where Ford learns that a Chevy Malibu driver takes a Spin scooter, now owned by Ford, three blocks every Wednesday. Whatever Ford learns about users, ""that is where it becomes even more powerful,"" he says. Ford CEO Jim Hackett echoed that point on a recent podcast. ""We know what people make. How do we know that? It's because they borrow money from us,"" he told Freakonomics Radio. ""And when you ask somebody what they make, we know where they work. We know if they're married. We know how long they've lived in their house, because these are all on the credit applications. We've never ever been challenged on how we use that. And that's the leverage we've got here with the data.""",https://www.npr.org/2018/11/16/668189361/why-ford-is-getting-into-the-scooter-business

As manufacturers showed off the latest gear and products, including scooter chargers, electric bikes and even electric unicycles – one entrepreneur boasted his electric skateboards are capable of speeds up to 25 miles per hour – city officials and pedestrians fretted over what to do about increasingly crowded sidewalks, providing a dose of reality to the mostly sunny outlooks on innovative ways of getting around in crowded cities. ""Dockless"" scooters – meaning you ride them and leave them anywhere – began appearing on city sidewalks across the nation just over a year ago, quickly becoming a scourge to municipal leaders worried about safety of both riders and pedestrians, not to mention the street clutter. Cities have only recently started to take action by limiting the number of scooters and cracking down on where they can be ridden or parked. Scooter companies themselves say they aren't opposed to reasonable regulation as more riders treat scooters as a serious means of transportation – a handy way to go short distances – not just as a novelty. In response to Freeman's question at the conference, a representative of the one of the largest scooter operators, Bird, struck an empathetic note. ""It's really critical we figure this out,"" replied YJ Fischer, Bird's senior director of global partnerships. Regulations could cost operators, but ""we are willing to make those investments in the community."" Transit experts see scooters as another way for commuters to bridge the link from their homes to bus stops or rail stations. Besides Bird, other upstarts have included those with similarly catchy names like Lime, Scoot, Skip and Jump. Scooters are serious business: Jump is part of ride-hailing service Uber. And automaker Ford just paid more than $40 million to buy scooter startup Spin. Only now, after a summer of scooter mayhem, are many cities starting to cope. In California's urban centers, where the scooters have become as common as taco trucks, the city of Beverly Hills opted to impose a six-month scooter ban. San Francisco issued a temporary ban, then limited the number of operators to two, while Santa Monica is experimenting with designating some street parking spaces for scooter parking. Other cities have tried similar approaches, including Nashville, Denverand Washington. San Jose, California, Mayor Sam Liccardo said in an interview that he's trying to use technology to rein in scooter issues. He said he's asking scooter companies to come up with plans to ensure their products are used safely and not in a way that interferes with walkers. One idea: Use ""geo-fencing"" – technology that keeps devices from working outside a designated area – to keep scooters off sidewalks. Another idea to prevent scooters from piling up on sidewalks would be to keep charging users until they are properly parked. He said he's acting on complaints about sidewalk riding or scooters left everywhere. ""We get a lot of complaints,"" he said in an interview after speaking at the conference. ""There is no question it is a problem anywhere in dense neighborhoods where we expect a lot of foot traffic."" At the conference, there was some hope for bringing peace to the streets. A couple of startups offered docks for what were previously dockless scooters. A startup called Swiftmile, for instance, showed one in which scooters could be plugged in to recharge instead of being left helter-skelter around the city for workers to hunt down and take in for recharging and redeployment. Freeman, a former professor of marketing, said despite the gains, the problems, at least in San Diego, remain. He said he came to the cause when a first-time scooter rider ran into his dog, River, as they strolled in a park. ""He was mildly apologetic,"" he said of the rider, and thankfully, the Shiba Inu was unhurt. That was only the start. ""The next point was the neighbors. They said 'I am afraid to go for a walk,'"" he recounted. Freeman said he has taken the cause of scooter regulation to two of his city's council committees. He even did a survey in which he talked to nearly 100 riders, about half of which were San Diego tourists, with most admitting they rode on sidewalks to get away from cars. But he said the scooter nightmare continues, and police aren't issuing enough tickets to sidewalk riders. ""This is badly affecting our quality of life,"" he said. ""It is a fundamentally unsafe form of transport.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/18/electric-scooters-driving-city-leaders-pedestrians-mad/2030745002/
"Elon Musk says electric scooters lack dignity, but truly sustainable mobility will require more than Tesla",NBC News,NBC,National,2018,11,26,"Elon Musk says electric scooters lack dignity, but truly sustainable mobility will require more than Tesla. Instead of fighting against the influx of bikes and scooters — or deriding them as uncool — we should embrace them. The status quo sure isn't working. As electric scooters roll out in more and more cities across the country, Elon Musk told Recode editor Kara Swisher recently that the electric scooter “lacks dignity.” The Tesla CEO noted that Swisher was “laboring under an illusion” if she really thought she looks great while riding one. Musk’s reaction may come as a surprise to some observers, but let’s be honest: Musk is a car man. Sure, he wants us all to switch from using internal combustion engines to batteries, but at his core Musk believes that automobiles should continue to dominate the transportation system. That flies in the face of growing recognition that truly sustainable mobility — which will be necessary to avoid the worst-case climate-change scenarios — will require far more than simply switching to electric cars. Remember that Musk doesn’t like public transportation — he’s called it “painful” and said that other passengers could be serial killers — and wants to build a system of tunnels that could be “10, 20, 30 layers deep (or more)” below Los Angeles so people can keep using cars without getting stuck in traffic. There are a lot of questions about this proposal — the cost savings he promises only he can deliver have already been achieved in other developed countries and his proposed car elevators seem like they would create terrible bottlenecks — but what about the human cost of continuing on an auto-dominated path of development? We accept the status quo because, in most cases, it’s all we know, but it actually has terrible impacts on our health. Between 1980 and 2014, the average commute increased nearly 20 percent to 26 minutes each way and the number of “megacommuters” — people who travel 60 to 90 minutes each way — has increased 64 percent since 1990. The longer the commute, the worse the health impacts. Driving more than ten miles each way has been associated with higher blood sugar, cholesterol and depression, according to a report in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine; while the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics linked commutes of more than 30 minutes each way to higher rates of anxiety, lower levels of happiness and less life satisfaction. And that’s before we even start talking about the lethal outcomes. In 2017, more than 40,000 people were killed in collisions with cars — more than the number of Americans who were killed with guns in 2016 — and that doesn’t even count the additional 53,000 premature deaths attributed to tailpipe emissions. It’s shocking how little outrage there is about vehicle deaths when compared to the growing coalition for gun control. Nevertheless, shifting away from automobile dominance in urban centers is becoming ever more realistic. Over the past year and a half, electric bikes and scooters (collectively part of the micro-mobility movement) were dumped on the sidewalks of cities across the country. In some places, there was backlash, and rightfully so. Few cities have dedicated lanes for bikes and scooters, yet all of a sudden there were far more people using them, usually in the very limited space allotted for pedestrians. Anger was to be expected, and government action soon followed. But whereas Uber and Lyft fought local governments tooth and nail to escape regulation, dockless bike and scooter companies have been generally more cooperative — it’s a lot easier to send a municipal employee around in a truck to impound a bunch of scooters than to do the same to Uber drivers. As a result, cities have been able to better regulate these new companies to limit the number of bikes and scooters on their streets, set speed limits, and demand trip data that they’ve had so much difficulty getting from ride-hailing companies. Cities have also been adapting to the new forms of mobility in their midst: Santa Monica installed special parking spaces for dockless bikes and scooters to ensure they aren’t cluttering sidewalks. Hopefully in the near future, cities will install more bike lanes. Making streets safer for dockless bikes and scooters could also have benefits for underserved communities. Black residents of Washington, D.C. are far more likely to use dockless bikes than the city’s docked bike-share service, according to mobility data company Populus, which also found that women and people with low incomes may be more likely to use scooters in major U.S. cities. Electric bikes, which are often part of these dockless services, have also been shown to be particularly attractive to drivers in Australian, Canadian, and U.S. cities in a review of recent research by Elliott Fishman and Christopher Cherry, and switching from cars to e-bikes would result in significant health benefits. It makes sense though. E-bikes require less work than a conventional bike, meaning fewer riders need a shower afterward, they make conquering hills much easier, and they’re faster than regular bikes (and cars stuck in traffic) so riders can use them for longer trips. Plus, the environmental footprint of a bike or scooter — electrified or not — is far smaller than a car, and when the City of Copenhagen measured the cost to society of transportation, including things like safety, tourism and health, it found that every kilometer (0.62 miles) of cycling produced a 26-cent economic gain for society, while each kilometer driven cost 14 cents. In the Netherlands, high rates of cycling prevent 6,500 premature deaths every year and save the country $23 billion, according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health. The United States holds freedom as its highest value, but forcing people to use cars to get around isn’t freedom at all. Of course, the Netherlands has both fewer people and higher rates of cycling than the United States, but that doesn’t mean U.S. cities can’t change. In the 1960s, the Dutch government razed neighborhoods in Amsterdam and other cities to make way for the automobile, following in the footsteps of their American counterparts. However, activism in the early 1970s forced the government to reconsider this strategy. Let’s be clear: Cars aren’t going to be abandoned tomorrow. They’ll continue to have an important role, especially outside urban cores, for years to come. But improving city public transit systems, widening sidewalks and giving dedicated space to micro-mobility options would make our lives easier and build activity into our daily routines, to name just two immediate benefits. The United States holds freedom as its highest value, but forcing people to use cars to get around isn’t freedom at all. True mobility freedom would mean providing citizens a range of options to get around cities, with reliable public transit and safe micro-mobility as convenient, less costly alternatives to cars. Instead of fighting against the influx of bikes and scooters — or deriding them as uncool or undignified — we should embrace them. And frankly, given the high cost of automobility and the pressing challenge of climate change, holding onto the status quo is the worst possible option.",https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/elon-musk-says-electric-scooters-lack-dignity-truly-sustainable-mobility-ncna940151
Let's Count the Ways E-Scooters Could Save the City,Wired,,National,2018,12,7,"Let's Count the Ways E-Scooters Could Save the City. The vehicles made by Bird, Lime, and the like can slash emissions, reinvigorate mass transit, and address America’s dependency on cars. For all the media narratives focusing on the unsavory aspects of the shared scooter and bike networks that have landed in cities in recent years—the clutter, the safety hazards, the lost parking spots—these “microbility” services have the potential to solve some of the biggest problems confronting urban and suburban communities. They can expand access to public transportation, reduce our environmental footprint, and save us money. Micromobility can be just as transformational as solar power or electric vehicles—with impacts that will be felt much sooner. Cities certainly must address legitimate concerns over safety and how best to absorb large volumes of two-wheel traffic on their streets and sidewalks, and the solution lies in more thoughtful and equitable allocation of street space. Land and lanes should be taken away from cars and dedicated to scooters and bicycles. Public transit systems should be redesigned to better integrate and leverage emerging micromobility networks. The stakes are high. For cities, there may be no faster and cheaper way to slash carbon emissions, reinvigorate mass transit, and address America’s wasteful and codependent relationship with the automobile. Looking for proof? This series of infographics, by Valence Strategic's Levi Tillemann and designer Lassor Feasley, breaks down the key reasons why policymakers ought to encourage micromobility’s proliferation. The enormous scale of environmental and land-use challenges confronting an increasingly urban global community means that there’s no time to lose. Efficiencies The most inefficient thing about driving a car is the car itself. The average American weighs about 175 pounds. According to a 2016 study by the US Department of Energy, the average American car weighs just under 4,100 pounds—23 times more than the person it carries. So most of the car’s energy is used to move the vehicle itself. Our reference e-scooter weighs just 28 pounds and runs off an efficient electric motor. That gives it a huge advantage in terms of energy use. One kilowatt hour of energy carries a gasoline-powered car a little less than a mile. A much more efficient Tesla Model 3 can travel about four miles on the same amount of energy. An electric scooter can travel more than 80 miles—or 333 laps around a football field. In fact, e-scooters are so efficient, a human would burn about nine times as much energy walking and about four times as much energy bicycling the same distance. The Cost of Fuel In their early years, electric vehicles and renewable energy have struggled against cheaper incumbent technologies powered by fossil fuels. In contrast, e-scooters are generally cheaper to utilize than alternatives like public transit, taxis, and personal cars. Part of the reason for that is that the cost of fueling an e-scooter is a little more than 1 percent of the cost of fueling even a car that delivers a respectable 28 miles per gallon. Over weeks, months, and years of commuting, those savings add up. The same thing that makes e-scooters environmentally friendly makes them economically attractive: efficiency. The Cost of Production E-scooters aren’t just energy efficient, they’re capital efficient. For the price of one long-range Tesla Model 3 (approximately $53,000), you could purchase more than 100 high-quality electric scooters. And while there are certainly conditions under which a scooter won’t be your best option (rain, snow, long-distance drive, moving kids or a pet), roughly 60 percent of US trips are under 5 miles and most of the time drivers ride alone. For a huge proportion of the trips Americans take, micromobility has the potential to provide transportation at a much lower economic and environmental cost. The Weight Not only are e-scooters energy efficient to use, they are energy efficient to manufacture. An average American automobile weighs about 4,100 pounds, and its production creates roughly 22seven tons of CO2 emissions. A short-range EV actually has a slightly higher carbon footprint than a gasoline-powered vehicle when it rolls off the manufacturing line (about 8 tons), but it generates much less carbon on the road, making it a greener alternative. An e-scooter weighs just 28 pounds, and requires far less energy to manufacture. While we don’t have exact numbers, it’s probably safe to assume the embedded energy is less than 1 percent of the embedded energy in an automobile. Embedded Energies As communities across the globe struggle to improve access to transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, they should recognize micromobility as a powerful and available ally. Electric micromobility devices are orders of magnitude cheaper to build, more energy efficient, and more fuel efficient than other alternatives. They require little or no additional infrastructure. These benefits should be considered as city planners decide what rules to impose on micromobility providers and how to allocate urban space. Cash-strapped governments are in desperate need of cost-effective solutions to mobility and climate challenges. And while micromobility won’t provide all the answers, it’s an important piece of the puzzle. OK, So What? For thousands of years, streets were built for pedestrians, vendors, and horses, and then eventually for carriages, cable cars, and bicycles. But over the 20th century networks of streets, avenues, and highways were purpose-built to carry rivers of metal—cars, hydrocarbons, and attendant emissions—across neighborhoods and continents. As cars got heavier, faster, more comfortable, and more ubiquitous, communities were designed to cater to them. Streets became polluted and perilous places for cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists. Today, in the US alone, road transit is responsible for 1,556 megatons of greenhouse gas emissions and 40,000 deaths annually. Driving both of those numbers toward zero ought to be a top policy priority in the decades to come. Fortunately, cities across America and the world have an opportunity to reboot their relationship with mobility, and potentially to break the link between transportation, oil, and the attendant emissions. For all the enthusiasm surrounding electric and self-driving cars, micromobility devices (small electric scooters and bicycles) may in fact be a much more powerful and immediate tool for slashing emissions and transforming our urban and suburban communities. There will be challenges and surprises along the way. Policymakers should treat these as data points instead of roadblocks and work to promote a system that is as safe and efficient as possible. Politicians and bureaucrats should also accept that the spread of micromobility is inevitable. It responds to critical problems confronting our cities, and in some senses it was a long time coming. This new modality also represents the surprising conclusion of a quest that started with the oil embargoes and environmental movement of the 1970s, when idealistic engineers envisioned ultralight, “right-sized” electric vehicles as a way to break the addiction to fossil fuels. While today’s electric scooters and bikes are less grandiose than the teardrop racers many anticipated, they are harbingers of the same vision.",https://www.wired.com/story/e-scooter-micromobility-infographics-cost-emissions/
Electric scooters need to toughen up — and stay out of lakes — if they are going to survive 2019,The Verge,Vox,National,2018,12,16,"Electric scooters need to toughen up — and stay out of lakes — if they are going to survive 2019. Assessing the long-term survivability of the latest transportation fad. In September 2017, a company called “Bird Rides” dumped several hundred electric scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, California, kicking off the scooter-sharing trend in the US. Fourteen months later, people are vandalizing those scooters and dumping them into lakes, and investors are losing interest. The explosive growth of dockless scooters and their contentious reputation was the surprise transportation story of the year. Bird and its main rival Lime are each worth an estimated $2 billion, and their popularity has given rise to over 30 scooter startups operating in an estimated 150 markets around the world. But as they head into year two, investors are losing interest while the business is growing increasingly expensive to operate, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal and The Information. Vandalism and depreciation costs are also taking their toll as scooter companies struggle to get their newer, more rugged models on the streets. The Information got a hold of Bird’s pitch book in October, and while the numbers may be a little out of date, they suggest the companies are struggling to turn a profit. Bird said it provided 170,000 rides per week in the first week of May. The company had around 10,500 “active” scooters during that period, and each one was used five times per day. Active scooters generate $3.65 in revenue per ride, the company said. Meanwhile, Bird spent $1.72 per ride on charging costs, and another $0.51 per ride, on average, on repairs. That doesn’t include credit card fees, permit fees, insurance, customer support, and other costs. So in May, Bird was pulling in about $602,500 in weekly revenue, offset by $86,700 in maintenance costs. That means Bird was eking out $0.70 in profit per ride, or a 19 percent gross profit margin. Those repair costs could go up, especially in light of recent news related to battery fires. In October, Lime recalled 2,000 scooters, less than one percent of its total fleet, following several fires. The startup placed the blame on Ninebot, which makes most of the scooters used in sharing services in the US. Ninebot, in turn, severed its relationship with Lime. But these repair costs don’t take into account the costs associated with vandalism. Encouraged by social media, anti-scooter types have knocked them into the streets, thrown them off parking garages, or even doused them with lighter fluid and set them on fire. According to Slate, the city of Oakland had to fish 60 electric scooters out of Lake Merritt in just the month of October. Environmentalists are calling it a “crisis.” Spin, a San Francisco-based company just acquired by Ford that operates scooters in a dozen markets in the US, says it starts under the optimistic assumption that its scooters will last a full-year, based on regular usage. “That is shortened by things like theft and abuse,” said Euwyn Poon, Spin’s co-founder. He declined to share the exact costs associated with vandalism, as did other scooter providers, citing proprietary information and non-disclosure agreements. Scooter vandalism “might be fun for a while,” Poon said. “When something new rolls out, people think its funny. But then the excitement goes away. And suddenly, it’s not a new thing.” Other scooter operators have said that vandalism isn’t as big an issue outside of cities like San Francisco and Washington, DC. A more systemic problem is the daily wear and tear associated with heavy fleet use of scooters. According to The Information, Bird said its electric scooters tend to last one to two months before they need to be replaced. Lime’s scooters have a similar lifespan. That makes the scooter startups’ efforts to build a more rugged version with longer battery life more urgent. Bird unveiled its “Bird Zero” model in September, with 60 percent more battery life, solid-core tires, and a wider and longer riding chassis for a more stable ride. Lime’s Gen 3 scooter roughly boasts the same specs. Ninebot — owner of the early-2000s version of e-scooters, the Segway — makes the majority of the scooters used by US sharing services. But their scooters are made for individual consumers, and not heavy fleet use. Sensing an opportunity, some smaller scooter manufacturers are emerging to challenge Ninebot’s hegemony. One example is the M Scooter Pro by Acton, a Mountain View-based company that also makes electric skateboards and rocket-skates at a facility in China. The M Scooter Pro, which has a more powerful battery, longer range, a built-in locking mechanism, and more durable parts, is set to debut in January 2019. Peter Treadway, chief technology officer at Acton, said the M Scooter Pro was “over built” to fulfill “very brutal needs.” These new scooters need to withstand up to 10 rides a day, plus all of the bumps and bruises associated with the operational side of the business. In most markets, scooters are gathered up in the evening by independent contractors, who take them home for overnight charging. These so-called “juicers” load the scooters into their personal vehicles. And typically they aren’t handled lightly, according to Michal Nakashimada, product manager at Ride Report who writes a weekly newsletter tracking the micro-mobility industry. “It’s just a lot of wear and tear in the back of a Honda Civic or a Ford F150,” he said. A possible solution to the depreciation associated with charging could be field-swappable batteries, in which a scooter’s depleted battery is exchanged for a fully charged one, which eliminates the need to take the entire vehicle off the street for charging. “That would significantly lower op costs when you can put 500 batteries in the back of the Sprinter van,” Nakashimada said. “And have one or two people just swapping vehicle batteries instead of having to put the whole unit into a van or taking it back home and recharging it. That would be exciting for the industry.” But what about vandalism? The solution most of the companies are talking about these days are “lock-to” mechanisms, which can take the form of retractable cables that can be wrapped around parking signs or streetlights. Uber’s Jump bikeshare bicycles have lock-to devices. Bird is testing out a retractable lock in Bakersfield, California. Acton’s M Scooter Pro also includes a locking mechanism, as well as an IoT box that allows fleet managers to remotely geofence the ride and set locations where users are allowed to park. “We’re just trying to keep scooters from being thrown in rivers or under buses or into trash cans,” Treadway said. Eventually the scooters may be able to report vandalism as it is happening in real time. “What happens when scooters aren’t in use?” Nakashimada asked. “They become a stack of sensors either mapping the environment, reporting vandalism by itself, providing data in municipalities.” Cities want access to that data, including information about repairs and maintenance logs. They are writing data-sharing provisions into the pilot programs they are creating as a way to prevent companies like Bird and Lime from dumping scooters on their streets indiscriminately. “They want to understand fleets, and how they’re changing over time,” said Regina Clewlow, CEO of Populus, a data-sharing firm that works with both scooter companies and cities. That said, the startups may try to block cities from publicizing information related to maintenance and vandalism. “It’s partly competitive intelligence, but practically speaking, they want to be able to grow their business and deal with all the growing pains without all their information being completely public.” Now that the initial shock of seeing thousands of dockless scooters littered across American cities has worn off, it’s time to step back and assess where this so-called “micromobility revolution” is taking us. Is it leading to a cleaner, more sustainable future where electric-powered scooters are the primary mode of transportation and polluting cars are left to gather dust? Or is it headed toward mass scooter graveyards like the mountains of discarded bikeshare bicycles seen in those viral photos from China? The scooter companies would obviously prefer the first outcome, but they’ll only get there if they can bulk up and get smart about how people are using — and misusing — these vehicles. If they can manage to stay on dry land and out of any major body of water, then maybe they’ll have a chance at becoming the future of transportation.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton
4 Major Reasons Shared Electric Scooters Will Transform Our Cities,Forbes,,National,2018,12,17,"4 Major Reasons Shared Electric Scooters Will Transform Our Cities. Our city cores, at once centers of commerce and culture, are also chokepoints for human travel. Sizable portions of our central business districts are devoted to roads and lanes, but as most anyone who has driven or taken transit downtown knows, it never feels like the roads allow for enough traffic to flow through. Even setting aside the logistical difficulties of expanding roads in city centers, the “fundamental law of road congestion” means that more or wider roads are not the answer. At its most fundamental level, every transport challenge is framed in the “door-to-door” scenario; what is someone’s best travel option to get from their current location to their final destination? Enter the shared electric scooter, a lightweight, powered vehicle that promises to transform our cities and offer a clever alternative to part of the transportation challenge that so many of us face daily. First Mile/Last Mile Time Savings The best transport solution is always one that takes you door-to-door. For most city dwellers, though, the daily commute usually involves a single mode of transport that carries them most of the way, with “first mile” and “last mile” components that involve walking. Example: walking to a bus stop closest to home (first mile), then taking the bus, then walking from the destination bus stop to the office (last mile). This occurs with private cars as well, as users often have to park in a parking lot that is some distance away from their final destination. The quandary posed by First Mile/Last Mile (FMLM) is that of efficiency. Distances that are just a bit too far to walk are also just a bit too short to drive or to take transit. Both solutions take time, either walking or waiting for the next bus. This is where shared electric scooters shine. They’re dockless, so you needn’t be restricted to areas designated for parking. Hop off the bus, find the closest electric scooter and travel to your final destination. Leave the scooter there for its next customer, which may be you on your return home! The time savings for first mile and last mile travel in a month could rise to dozens of hours. Parking Spaces & Pollution Consider what it would mean to remove cars from the road should conditions arise where taking transit and shared scooters provided an automobile-competitive solution. Not only would that mean less congestion on our roads—particularly roads into and out of our urban cores—but reduced air pollution and less need for parking spaces. This drives an interesting long-term consequence: as there is less demand for parking spaces, prices for parking drop, which makes parking less profitable, so parking spaces are removed and more room is freed up for other developments, such as green spaces. Green spaces help beautify urban cores, and draw people into physical activity. This leads to a healthier community, simply by providing an acceptable and realistic alternative to private automobiles in urban centres. Affordability Perhaps one of the most compelling features of shared scooters is how affordable they are to most people. They aren’t expensive to use: $1 to unlock and $0.15 per minute is the typical pricing structure used by Bird and Lime in the U.S. An average trip is only a few dollars, which amounts to far less than the cost of gas, insurance and parking were someone to use their private car to commute, even taking into account the costs of using public transit for the middle part of the journey. Further, families that don’t own cars don’t need to shoulder the considerable financial burden of owning, operating and maintaining a private auto. Relying on the combination of public transit and shared scooters is ultimately easier on the pocketbook. Fit with Transit For a FMLM solution, shared electric scooters hit that door-to-door sweet spot when coupled with public transit. They’re powered, so walking or pedaling are not required. They’re small, so they don’t have a large parking footprint when left. They’re electric, so they’re quiet and don’t produce polluting emissions. They’re fast enough to cut the time required for that usual 8-block walk to your office by up to 90%, but they’re not so fast that they’re a terrible hazard. They support public transit use by solving FMLM for people in urban cores, and do it inexpensively and with the environment in mind. Lime and Bird have been in the shared scooter space for less than two years. We’re still in early days, but the industry has learned many lessons in this relatively short time. We currently sit on the cusp of an explosion of innovations and improvements for shared scooter services and options, many of which are likely to have lasting positive impacts on our cities in the foreseeable future. What we do know is that shared electric scooters have an important role to play in the mobility economy, and they are here to stay.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnfrazer1/2018/12/17/4-major-reasons-shared-electric-scooters-will-transform-our-cities/
States Race to Catch Up With Electric Scooters,Wall Street Journal,,National,2018,12,17,"States Race to Catch Up With Electric Scooters. California lawmakers passed bill on new two-wheeled vehicles; more states planning legislation. State and local officials across the U.S. are scrambling to regulate the fast-growing electric-scooter industry—and in some cases banning the two-wheeled devices until laws can be crafted. About a year after startups like Bird Rides Inc. and Lime began spreading them around the country, sometimes without warning or seeking prior approval, thousands of scooters can be rented by the minute in dozens of cities and on many college campuses. Many cities lacked rules when the scooters, which can go 15 miles an hour, hit their streets and sidewalks, and some states have longstanding laws that appear to outlaw them. “It does feel a little bit like the Wild West,” said Kate Fillin-Yeh, strategy director at the National Association of City Transportation Officials. That is changing. At least 15 state legislatures are likely to take up scooter bills in coming legislative sessions, said Douglas Shinkle, transportation program director at the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. Only about 10 states currently have laws that apply to vehicle categories that appear to include e-scooters, he said, and only California’s legislature has passed a bill specifically addressing them. “A lot of lawmakers are probably going to be interested in setting the rules so it’s safe, but not squashing the industry,” he said. “These e-scooters are being used. That tells you they’re filling a need.” More than 25 states and Washington, D.C., have e-scooter sharing services operating in them, according to scooter-sharing companies. Florida Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes said he would introduce a bill in March, when the new legislative session begins, to clarify that they are legal under state law. “It’s all brand new, and we want to maximize our flexibility,” he said, adding the state will likely leave rule making largely to local officials. Scooter companies face a potential hurdle in Pennsylvania, where a law classifies e-scooters as “motor vehicles,” meaning they must be titled, insured, inspected and registered. Any change would require legislation. David Estrada, chief legal officer and head of government partnerships at Bird, said while the company disagrees with that reading of Pennsylvania law, it has engaged in dialogue with Philadelphia officials. Companies have stayed on the sidelines as the city writes a rulebook for e-scooters and other shared micro-mobility devices. The city has been “pretty patient” and “slow” in developing regulations, said Aaron Ritz, Philadelphia’s transportation programs manager. Scooters are a hot topic among his counterparts around the U.S. “The general three-word summary is, ‘Oh my God,’” he said. “I think everybody is pretty overwhelmed with the whole process of dealing with something being pushed so very rapidly.” Nationally, 39 of the 100 largest cities have e-scooter rental services. Of those, 32 have some oversight in place, according to NACTO. Scooter-sharing companies say they are providing an inexpensive transportation option that cuts congestion and car use, and are willing to work with local authorities on regulation. Critics often point to hazards for riders and pedestrians. Two e-scooter riders died in September after crashes in Dallas and Washington, D.C., according to police. Bird, which launched in September 2017 and now has scooters in more than 70 North American cities, follows local laws that aren’t always “100% clear,” said Mr. Estrada. “Free enterprise is you can start a business until and unless it gets regulated,” he said. “When a city decides to regulate it, you work with them. That’s what we do.” Lime, which operates dockless bike and e-scooter sharing services, said it is working with policy makers in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Jersey to clarify “outdated laws that prevent cities from bringing scooters to their communities.” The company said it has been working with officials in North Carolina to ensure e-scooters and mopeds aren’t treated the same under the law. Mopeds go much faster and are subject to additional licensing, titling and other regulations. In Atlanta, where scooter sharing services appeared in early May, some city council members want to impose rules that would also apply to dockless bicycles. A pending bill would require companies to obtain a $12,000 annual permit for operating 500 devices and to pay $50 for each additional device. It would bar scooters from sidewalks and from exceeding 15 miles an hour, and it spells out where they could be parked. “We want to make sure we put in fair rules that won’t hurt commerce, but at the same time will look out for the safety and welfare of our citizens,” said Michael Julian Bond, a member of the Atlanta City Council. Mr. Bond said scooters have filled a void in the city, which is notorious for traffic and lacks an extensive public-transit network. But he also said many residents complain about riders zipping along on sidewalks and leaving scooters strewn around town. It is already illegal under state law to ride on city sidewalks, though the Atlanta Police Department said it hasn’t issued any citations. Some cities and colleges are taking a harder line. The University of Georgia impounded 1,206 of Bird’s scooters after the company put them on its Athens campus in August without approval. The university says the company owes it $718,000 in fines and fees. Athens-Clarke County officials voted Dec. 4 to ban e-scooters for up to a year so regulations can be developed. Bird said the university is denying students, faculty and staff a mobility option many of them want, and said it hopes to reach a resolution with UGA. In Denver, where close to 1,700 e-scooters are in use, city officials proposed Dec. 5 to update a law that classifies e-scooters as “toy vehicles.” That means e-scooter riders currently must use sidewalks, and officials say they have heard numerous pedestrians concerns. The proposed law would require scooters to use a bike lane, if available, or a roadway with a speed limit up to 30 mph. Otherwise, scooters could legally use the sidewalk, provided the rider didn’t exceed 6 mph. The Colorado legislature would need to change a state law that also labels scooters as toys.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-race-to-catch-up-with-electric-scooters-11545051600
Breakingviews - Scooters will soon find city-friendly sweet spot,Reuters,,National,2018,12,19,"Breakingviews - Scooters will soon find city-friendly sweet spot. Purveyors of electric scooters to urbanites, Bird and Lime most prominent among them, are all the rage in Silicon Valley. The toy-like tech marvels sometimes clog up streets and sidewalks, falling foul of officials even in San Francisco. Yet they are also a bridge between cars or mass transit and walking – a low-cost, green, last-mile transport option. They may soon find a city-friendly sweet spot. Santa Monica is ground zero for the scooter wars, which kicked off in 2017. The Californian city is also in the vanguard of efforts to control their proliferation and devise rules for use and placement. After the vehicles appeared by the thousand, San Francisco banned them in May, allowing them back three months later under licenses that severely limit their number. Lime and others are now transporting Parisians, and New York City Council members in late November introduced bills to legalize electric scooters and bikes. Meanwhile venture capitalists can’t get enough. Bird and Lime each raised more than $400 million earlier in 2018, according to news reports, with Bird aiming for a $2 billion valuation. Car-hailing giant Uber bought Jump, another e-scooter provider, and rival Lyft is in on the business too. Uber may even be interested in buying part or all of one of the leading scooter firms, according to news reports. There’s overlap with shared human-powered and electric bikes. But scooter mania reflects their ability to substitute taxis or walking for short journeys – say from a subway to an office – as well as their compact size, relatively lower costs, and perhaps greater fun factor. The modus scooterandi has followed Uber’s example: Show up aggressively in a market first, and deal with problems later. Blocked sidewalks, broken equipment, regulation, safety and other concerns have cropped up. There are signs that Bird, for one, is taking a more measured approach now. In New York, it’s organizing demonstrations of its e-scooters and working with legislators. That approach makes sense, because although scooters, like bikes, are an appealing addition to urban transport, they can also quickly become a menace – and subject to knee-jerk bans by local authorities – if a city’s infrastructure can’t handle them. New York, for instance, has over 1,000 miles of bike lanes and a Citi Bike share program, operated by Lyft-owned Motivate, that has been going for five years, but there’s still too much scope for scooters, bikes, and cars to mix in dangerous ways. And scooters, which don’t need docks, can be left anywhere (like across a sidewalk) if they aren’t corralled. Travis VanderZanden, founder and chief executive of Bird, in March 2018 urged fellow scooter companies to avoid out-of-control deployment. As well as managing fleets of typically Chinese-made two-wheelers more thoughtfully, one of his ideas is to share $1 per scooter per day of revenue with cities to fund infrastructure. Startups like the various fast-growing scooter outfits – also including Skip, Spin and Goat – aren’t known for making money. And their financial ability to contribute much to infrastructure is questionable based on a rough picture of their economics, using data reported by the Information and Michael Babich via Medium. The average scooter is used for maybe six rides a day, bringing in perhaps $3.50 in revenue per ride, or about $21 a day. That may call for two daily battery charges, at a cost of say $5 each (Bird pays ordinary folks to pick up, charge and replace scooters). Maintenance costs another $3 a day. So far, so good. A plausible target up-front price for a scooter is $400. The current models last two months with luck, so the up-front cost spread over time comes out a bit over $6.50 a day. Put even these fairly generous estimates together, and there’s less than $1.50 a day left to cover all other expenses – credit-card charges, corporate costs, insurance, and so on. In some cities scooter providers already pay up-front or ongoing levies in return for licenses. But thin margins make VanderZanden’s revenue-sharing idea look a bit of a stretch. Some costs may already be going down as scooter firms expand, like the up-front cost of a vehicle – though President Donald Trump’s import tariffs could push that up again – and charging, assuming battery improvements. And if demand is strong compared to the number cities license, that may enable scooter firms to push up prices. Even so, while there’s more hope than for ride-hailing outfits like Uber it’s not certain they will become long-term profitable. If they can work it out, both sides have something to gain. Even a dollar a day could make a difference for host cities. Suppose New York had 12,000 scooters, the same as its Citi Bike fleet. The revenue share, based on the same ride assumptions, would top $4 million a year. The average cost of creating a mile of bikeway with road improvements runs about $240,000, according to a five-year-old University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center study. At that price, the scooter operators’ contribution would build nearly 20 miles of bike path per year – a decent chunk of the 50 miles annually targeted by the New York City transport department. It could be one way forward, as long as the scooter business model can stand it.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-transportation-scooters-breakingviews-idUSKCN1OI29D
The weirdest places we found scooters in 2018,Curbed,Curbed,National,2018,12,21,"The weirdest places we found scooters in 2018. Scooters were everywhere in 2018. Here’s proof. Whether you live in Los Angeles or Washington D.C., most cities in the United States are grappling with a new transportation issue: The arrival of dockless electric scooters. E-scooters have grown so quickly, in fact, that Curbed hailed 2018 as the year of the scooter. Faced with an onslaught of scooters from companies like Bird and Lime, cities have struggled to regulate what scooter use should look like. When companies—unbeknownst to city officials—introduced dockless bikes and scooters to streets, local officials have often responded with bans to rein in the activities of users. Need an example? Read about Santa Monica, over here. Despite their rough introduction, scooters offer the potential for an accessible, car-free, and sustainable mode of transport. But that’s only if they can survive that long. Vandalism has been a major problem for scooter companies, reflected in new Instagram accounts and hashtags that explore #scootersbehavingbadly. From high atop bridges to the deepest of rivers, scooters have ended up in rather bizarre locations. For proof, we’ve rounded up the best—or maybe its the worst—of this year’s scooter behavior. Anyone who lives in a city with scooters has seen this one: Scooters scattered all over the sidewalk. Often blocking the path and making it hard to get around. But scooter parts have also ended up in other weird places, like the grocery store. Or the top of a lifeguard stand. In fact, scooters are all over the beach. Including the ocean. Other bodies of water aren’t immune to scooters, either. It’s even become a bit of a business to pull scooters out of lakes and rivers and turn them in for the reward fees. Some people put scooters in trash cans. And we’re not sure why, but we’ve also seen them on top of stop signs. Or any sign, really. Perhaps one of the weirdest places is the bathroom. Maybe this scooter user didn’t want to leave the scooter outside? Another Bird scooter takes a swim. Scooters are important for transportation, but we don’t think you’re supposed to take them into the subway station. Or on the actual subway. Or in the parking garage. And they definitely shouldn’t be hanging off of bridges. Which appears to be a thing? Of course, the most bizarre place we’ve seen a scooter is probably this photo:",https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/21/18152121/electric-scooter-bird-lime-cities-scooters-behaving-badly
"Electric Scooters: Last-Mile Mobility, Thrill Rides, Public Nuisance Or Hazard",Forbes,,National,2018,12,24,"Electric Scooters: Last-Mile Mobility, Thrill Rides, Public Nuisance Or Hazard. Paradigm-shifting innovations have brought in both operational and cost efficiencies in the transportation industry. Taxis and limousines gave way to ride-sharing operators like Uber and Lyft. And now we see scores of self-operated rented electric scooters roaming around the cities. To rent, download the scooter operator app on the smartphone; use the app to locate and walk to a nearby scooter; unlock the scooter with a credit card and begin to cruise at up to 15-20 miles per hour (mph) speed. Ride it down the street; around the neighborhood or across the city blocks. Upon reaching the destination, park anywhere, tap the smartphone lock to end the ride and walk away. Numerous rental electric scooter operators have sprung up. Bird and Lime, two of the biggest providers, have deployed scooters in nearly 30 US cities in recent months. Scooter companies claim they reduce car trips and transport the public through the first and last mile segments of their trips. Ironically, the scooters are predominantly used for thrill riding. Riders perceive many apparent benefits from renting these electric scooters. They are easy to locate; convenient and cash-free to rent; ride effortlessly; fun and cool; “dock-less,” park anywhere, no designated pick up or drop off locations. Scooters generally rent for $1 to start and thereafter charge 15 cents a minute for the ride. This attractive pricing makes short trips cheaper than an Uber ride or a bike share rental. Scooters can offer a quick, convenient and inexpensive self-operated ride to a train station, a bus stop or a specific destination. Unlike walking or bicycling, the electric scooters require no physical effort. No walking or bike peddling to get to the destination means no sweating or discomfort or changing of attire at the end of the ride. Based on published reports, venture-funded companies, Bird and Lime are showing hockey-stick adoption rates and attaining unicorn valuations. Unfortunately, these companies are introducing substantial collateral safety hazards into the urban transportation ecosystem. Existing urban transportation ecosystem consisting of motor vehicles, motorbikes, bicycles, and pedestrians cannot safely accommodate the recently deployed fast electric-scooters. Cities have not yet provisioned dedicated and protected scooter paths. Riders are thus forced to take the scooters on to sidewalks, bike paths, and motor vehicle roads. Consequently, making the existing transport ecosystem more hazardous and prone to accidents. To get around busy city traffic or for sheer thrill, many scooter riders weave in and out of traffic. When the riders feel vulnerable and exposed on the roads, for personal safety, they whimsically choose to ride on the foot-paths and risk collision with pedestrians. The fun and thrill are causing many to ride at high speeds, making themselves “human missiles.” On the other hand, pedestrians feel encroached and traumatized by these fast approaching scooters. While scooter riders feel vulnerable on the road; by riding on the foot-paths, they present a similar hazard to the pedestrians. Collision incidences between scooter riders and motor-vehicles or pedestrians can lead to lasting injuries or fatalities. Hospitals and clinics are seeing increasing numbers of scooter collision related bodily injuries and concussions. Published reports state many causes of scooter incidents. Such as the rider loses control and crashes onto a curb, wall or pedestrian; car collides with the rider; scooter crashes due to malfunctioning tires or brakes or stuck-throttle. Hazard causing, helmetless, solo and tandem/double riders zipping in and out of traffic and sidewalks are a common sight in the cities where the scooters have been deployed. Recklessly parked, so-called dock-less scooters left anywhere and everywhere are exacerbating the inconvenience and risks to the general city public. Undaunted, scooter rental networks are being populated and expanded in an Armageddon fashion, also known as “Scooter-geddon.” Operators are deploying the scooters sometimes even without getting permits. The scooters are “invading” the cities before the regulators can catch on. An unintended and damaging consequence of the adoption of electric scooters as a transportation alternative causes an overall reduction in the aggregate physical activity of the city dwellers. For instance, taking the scooter instead of walking to the bus stop or train station; sidewalks encroached with electric vehicles creating a disincentive for physically active pedestrians, reduce aggregate physical activity. Low physical activity is documented as one of the biggest health threats worldwide and is considered to be a significant contributor to the epidemics of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancers, dementia, etc. The US already is amongst the weakest statistics holder for walking as a means for transportation. Electric scooters are being marketed as an environmentally friendly and inexpensive last-mile transportation solution for city dwellers. However, their adoption is causing a rise in scooter incidence fatalities. Formal accident statistics of significance are not yet available for this new urban transportation phenomenon. Trauma centers have started to document scooter-related accidents. Nascent anecdotal data in the public domain strongly suggest that electric scooter accidents have surged in 2018. Injured scooter riders are flooding city emergency rooms, and accident rates could be as high as 1,000 per month. Bird and Lime scooter companies have been accused of ‘gross negligence’ in a Class-action lawsuit. Rentable self-operated electric scooters have many purported benefits. However, these professed benefits introduce collateral safety hazards to the city-dwellers. City authorities and scooter operators urgently need to collaborate to create a safer deployment cycle for the emerging scooter industry. As a consideration, to safely accommodate scooters, targeted city locales should be cordoned off from motor vehicles. “Dock-less” should not mean reckless. These scooters need to be parked away from the pedestrian paths.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2018/12/24/electric-scooters-last-mile-mobility-thrill-rides-public-nuisance-or-hazard/
"Stolen, burned, tossed in the lake: e-scooters face vandals' wrath",The Guardian,,National,2018,12,28,"Stolen, burned, tossed in the lake: e-scooters face vandals' wrath. Environmentalists raise concern as Lime and Bird vehicles pile up in California lake. It was a sight as common at Oakland’s Lake Merritt as the ducks paddling on the water or the seagulls fighting over scraps: a bright green motorized Lime scooter was submerged just feet off the murky shore. “Aw man, the Lime person just came by this morning,” James Robinson, executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, said when he found out about the latest scooter deposit. It was just one of nearly 100 Lime and Bird scooters that have been dumped in the lake since late September, Robinson said. In October alone, he said, his volunteers counted 60. This year may go down in the history books as the year of the scooter: the year all different brands and colors began appearing along sidewalks around the world, seemingly out of nowhere. To those who hate them, they’re like an invasion from a dystopian robot future. To their fans, they’re the future of urban transport: green, high tech and fun. What is undeniable is that the rollout could hardly be described as smooth, with vigilantes, decrying what they describe as typical tech industry hubris of companies profiting off of public spaces, expressing their displeasure through vandalism. Some have defaced the vehicles with profane stickers and feces. Others have tossed them into trash cans and trees. And then, of course, there’s the dumping in waterways. A website tracking scooters tossed in the Willamette river counted 17 in August alone. San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental watchdog group, has recorded at least two scooters that have ended up in the San Francisco Bay since May. The organization has since taken up the cause against the dumping in Lake Merritt, near its offices. “We’ve just been so frustrated,” said the Baykeeper executive director, Sejal Choksi-Chugh. “They’re just not taking this seriously.” Meanwhile, few scooter companies will say for sure how many scooters have been vandalized, stolen, or damaged in the past year – or even how many scooters they’ve launched worldwide. Scoot Networks told the Wall Street Journal that more than 200 of the 650 scooters in San Francisco had been stolen or irreparably destroyed within two weeks of their launch, but Lime did not respond to questions on this particular topic. A Skip spokesperson says the company does not disclose numbers when it comes to theft but that Skip has seen an overall decrease. Bird issued a statement: “Vandalism of all types of property is a problem that should not be tolerated by communities or local law enforcement.” “We do not support the vandalism or destruction of any property and are disappointed when it takes place,” a Bird spokesperson said. “Nor do we support the encouragement, celebration or normalization of this behavior. Bird encourages people in communities to report incidents of vandalism to Birds, and irresponsible behavior on Birds, to local authorities and to the company. We investigate all reports directed to Bird and take appropriate measures, including removing people from the Bird platform.” But through social media, the documentation of the destruction has been vast. A number of accounts exist on Instagram dedicated to posting videos and photos of all sorts of scooter vandalism. Bird Graveyard, an account run by three friends in west Los Angeles, has more than 66,000 followers and receives anywhere from 50 to 100 submissions of scooter vandalism a day via direct message, from all around the world. The first post, on 23 June, shows a pile of Bird scooters, one visibly broken. From there, the posts steadily escalate with videos of people throwing scooters off of buildings, scooters on fire, scooters that had been run over by a car, and dogs defecating on scooters. The three men who run the account have never disclosed their names because of the nature of the material, but one who spoke to the Guardian said they were shining a light on a problem. “At the beginning, it was just a joke, to bring attention to it,” he said. “But we obviously feel a very certain way about it.” He said while he could appreciate the premise behind the scooters – an eco-friendly urban transportation alternative – he was put off by how the companies went about introducing the idea. In a way, the dockless nature of these scooters that these companies celebrate – the freedom to pick up and leave them wherever – can give the impression that the companies don’t care, whether it be about their product or the cities where it appears. “They just started popping up one day and nobody really asked for it,” the person behind Bird Graveyard said. “We weren’t really told it was going to happen. And this has happened everywhere.” The account was suspended once, he said, and it has had posts taken down – one video from Nashville of a car running a red light to run over a scooter was removed because Instagram told Bird Graveyard that it promoted violence. But the team say they are not worried about legal repercussions because they are not committing the vandalism: “We identify with the anger and how it’s being expressed, but we’re in our 30s almost,” he said. “If I was 18, hell yeah. I’d be out there scratching scooters because I wouldn’t know any better.” Their hope, they say, is that the vandalism will push a conversation and force the companies to consider their behavior when it comes to rolling out these scooters in different cities. Some companies have already done just that, especially following enforcement in some of the flagship cities. San Francisco, one of the first battlegrounds for the scooter war of 2018, impounded 503 scooters in the first incursion in the spring – 208 from Lime, 193 from Bird, and 102 from Spin, said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for the city’s department of public works. The city returned the scooters to their respective companies after they paid their fees, Gordon said – Lime paid $15,784.50, Bird $15,547.17, and Spin $14,189.06. San Francisco has since launched a pilot scooter program, granting permits to Scoot and Skip in October. In the first six months, each company will be allowed a maximum of 625 scooters, with the potential to increase in the following six months to a cap of 2,500. “Skip’s strategy is to work closely with cities to be the best regulatory brand and leverage our co-founders’ experience to build the best scooters in the market,” said the company’s chief marketing officer, Julie Supan. “We only enter cities with local support.” While companies will work with local law enforcement when it comes to property damage and vandalism of their scooters, few work with community groups in seeking measures to curb environmental damage. According to Robinson, the executive director of the Lake Merritt Institute, only Lime is actively working with his organization, sending a representative to weekly cleanups to better understand the lake and how to retrieve the scooters. Robinson and his volunteers have been instructed by both Lime and Bird not to touch the scooters, which is frustrating, because company representatives don’t always end up locating the scooters in a timely manner. Lime has agreed to make the area around the lake a no-parking zone for its scooters, but at least two were still parked along the perimeter one recent day – and dozens more were located feet away. Robinson said he believed the solution was for the scooters to get some sort of locking and docking mechanism, like the Ford rental bicycles in the region. When the bicycle program first launched, he said, a few ended up in the lake, but the dumping stopped once permanent docking stations were put in place. “We have to, at some point, put the environment above profits,” Robinson said. “The community cares about the lake and it’s disheartening for them to come out week after week and see these products out in the lake and not harbor some kind of bad feelings toward these companies.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/28/scooters-california-oakland-los-angeles-bird-lime
2018 Was the Year of the Scooter. What Happens Now?,Wired,,National,2018,12,30,"2018 Was the Year of the Scooter. What Happens Now? After the mania comes the grind. If you say you saw this coming, I don’t believe you. In 2018, electric scooter-share stole the mobility show. They arrived unannounced in cities. They provoked fierce council meetings and protests. They launched debates about who owns sidewalks, anyway, and what role regulators play in bossing around big business. They sucked up VC dollars, mountains of them, as upstarts crowed about the revenue generated per scoot. They got damaged and fixed, they launched their own new gig economy jobs. Why it happened is part crystal clear, part murky. Thanks to Uber, Lyft, and bike-share programs, the smartphone-toting masses have become more comfortable with the idea of using vehicles they don’t own. Traffic is on the rise (thanks in part to ride-hail!), which no doubt pushed some sick n’tired commuters to try the two-wheeled things that just showed up. The scooters are also easy to ride, even fun. Putting Insta-friendly models and celebrities on the things probably didn’t hurt. (Congratulations to the scooter companies’ marketing teams. Ish.) But why does any trend happen, anyway? Investors got hyped about scooters, so they poured money into it: The Wall Street Journal reports Bird is currently raising money at a $2 billion valuation, and Lime between $2 and $3 billion. Remember, pretty much no one had heard of these companies less than a year ago. But now, the Journal has reported that investor enthusiasm for scooters has cooled amid questions about the economics of the whole concept. So in 2019, expect scooter companies and scooter-ed cities to get to the grind—and enact some shake-ups. Here are our biggest outstanding questions: Who will win the hardware throwdown? In the second year of the post-scooter era, competitors will continue to differentiate themselves by hardware. They will need to make their products easier, safer, more reliable, and more satisfying to use for customers. They need to keep them easy to clean and maintain, and hardy enough to survive for longer on the streets, vandals be damned. (Both companies operating scooters in San Francisco right now have openly admitted that theft and vandalism is a big problem.) The companies also might need to make some modifications to satisfy their real overlords: city governments, which often retain control of the sidewalks and parking spots where scooters rest. To that end, Lime and Bird both introduced a new generation of scooters this fall, with plans to add sturdier wheels and tech that might help them get a handle on users’ bad behavior. San Francisco-based Skip has rolled out some scoots with retractable locks, to make sure their vehicles don’t get in the way on streets. (Execs say this is a feature that cities worried about sidewalk clutter have asked for.) Scoot has too. Some Skip scooters will also now come with rear-facing cameras, which will help the company monitor whether their riders are complying with local regulations. Another important innovation, that may or may not appear in 2019: swappable batteries. Uber-owned Jump just announced its next-gen bikes will come with this new-ish tech, which will make operations much easier for its teams. Right now, many companies' charging is done by freelance “chargers” and “juicers,” who gather bikes and scooters, bring them inside, plug them all in, and put them back on the street once they’re charged up. Swappable batteries would keep the entire fleet on the road. You’d just need a few people to go around popping charged packs into tired rides. However companies choose to change up their scoots in 2019, know that their goal is to make these things less fun diversion, more legitimate transportation option. As they run out of markets to expand into, there will be fewer and fewer riders who take their products for a spin out of pure curiosity. “We need to be able to provide robust, reliable service instead of people trying it for fun,” says Lime CEO Toby Sun. (The company began the year as LimeBike—how things have changed.) “We hope to see mass adoption in 2019.” What do regulators do? Then there’s whatever city governments decide to do. A year into scootermania, most local officials have moved pretty quickly, at least by their standards. They’ve set up pilot projects to learn more about how scooters might fit into their transportation mix, demanding data so they can examine their biggest questions—who rides these things? Are they accessible to low-income people? Are they fairly distributed throughout the urban streetscape? Do they get in the way? The problem for scooter companies comes when cities curtail their launches. Many governments have capped the number of the vehicles, with the rationale that they’d like to understand them better before they let them go wherever they want. But caps make the network difficult for customers to use—I can never find one when I want one!—and make the entire business less workable as the companies struggle with economies of scale. Other startups have been banned entirely from city streets. Witness San Francisco, which allows just two companies to operate, and only for a limited one-year pilot. (Lime, which did not win a permit there, is vigorously protesting the process.) Scoot-friendly infrastructure is also mostly out of companies’ control. That’s unfortunate, because research finds that some people (women, especially) will not ride alternative vehicles in mixed traffic, amongst the multi-ton caprice of cars. Most companies have offered funding to build protected scoot- and bike-lanes themselves, but governments can get hamstrung by the things that always hamstring governments: vociferous neighborhood opposition, lawsuit threats, the near-unbelievable cost that comes with just putting paint and planters down on roads. So yes: The future of scooters is also full of lobbying. What will the research say? 2019 will also be the year that everyone learns more about what scooters are actually doing on city streets. One nice about scooter-government relations thus far is that city halls have managed to extract more serious promises about data-sharing than they ever did with the companies leading the last wave of transportation disruption—Uber and Lyft chief among them. Now, companies are even working with officials on open data standards that will make their wheeled things easier to track. (Of course, those companies now include Uber and Lyft.) Which means there’ll be info for researchers to work with. The biggest question those folks will ask is probably, are these scooter genuine transportation options, or overblown toys? Are they replacing car trips and making it easier for people to connect to public transit, or are they replacing walking for riders who are in a hurry and maybe a little lazy? How much are they actually reducing emissions? Thus far, outsiders have to rely on the companies’ own internal data for these all-important queries. Soon, though, there should be more impartial sources of information. A year into scooters, some positive stories are already emerging. A DePaul University study released this month found a theoretical Chicago scooter-share service could fill transportation gaps. (Note: The researchers did receive some funding from Bird, but said the money did not influence their work.) Wouldn’t it be nice if 2019 held some feel-good news?",https://www.wired.com/story/2018-year-of-the-scooter-what-happens-2019/
Could electric scooters become the new bikeshare?,CNN,,National,2018,15,2,"Could electric scooters become the new bikeshare? A souped-up kids' toy is turning into a hot transportation option for adults. Cities are taking interest in electric scooter-share systems as an affordable commuting alternative to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion. The electric scooters, which weigh between 30 and 40 pounds, reach speeds of about 15 mph. In September, Santa Monica, California, became the first U.S. city to have an electric scooter-share service. Users find and unlock one of the more than 1,000 scooters with a smartphone app. A ride costs a minimum of $1, and then .15 cents for each minute of riding throughout the beach town. Bird, the startup operating the scooter-share, picks up the scooters every night to charge them, and places them around Santa Monica each morning for commuters. The company was created by former Uber and Lyft executive Travis VanderZanden after he realized ridesharing services didn't have a positive impact on traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Since its September 2017 launch, Bird's system has served more than 50,000 riders who have taken 250,000 trips -- more than half of which have been in the last month. It's since expanded to Venice, California, and some neighborhoods in Los Angeles and San Diego. Bird plans to expand to dozens of markets by the end of 2018. Competitors, backed by Silicon Valley investors, are emerging. Two dockless bikeshare startups, LimeBike and Spin, have announced plans to deploy electric scooters in cities this year. Meanwhile, another rival, URB-E, has sold thousands of foldable electric scooters to consumers since 2015. The company's electric scooters range in price from $900 - $2,000. Late last year, it began renting URB-Es on the University of Southern California's campus. It plans to launch its own shared service in cities such as San Francisco and New York by the end of the year. ""It took a couple years for the mass market to realize this is not a toy industry or for rich people,"" said URB-E CEO Peter Lee. ""But this solves an everyday commuter problem, no matter your social class or how much you make. It was seen as a novelty three years ago, but now it's seen as a necessity."" Electric scooters have also captured the attention of Mayor Pete Buttigieg from South Bend, Indiana. The city, which has limited transit options due to its moderate density, is interested in using them as a way to improve transportation access. South Bend was one of the first to embrace dockless bikeshare systems, which allow people to park rented bikes on public land. ""We love to be early adopters,"" said Buttigieg. ""If we satisfy the safety puzzle, we would be open to welcoming the technology."" But there aren't clear best practices for where electric scooters can be ridden, how fast they can go or if a helmet should be worn. Santa Monica recently took the electric scooter startup Bird to court for not having an appropriate business license. On Wednesday, Bird agreed to pay over $300,000 in fines. ""We need to make sure these new transportation systems are lawful and safe for users,"" Constance Farrell, a spokeswoman for the city of Santa Monica told CNN. ""We would like to see motorized scooters continue to operate in the city. They are in line with our focus on multi-modal living and carbon-light living."" According to Farrell, there have been eight accidents, including one with a serious head injury, in Santa Monica after the scooters rolled out. In some other cases, police officers have issued tickets for improper use of the scooters. Users are required to have a driver's license, shouldn't ride on sidewalks or have other passengers on board. Bird has given out free helmets to some riders and tells its users to ride in bike lanes, but some users ride on sidewalks, and most U.S. streets don't have bike lanes. Spin president Euwyn Poon believes riding on the sidewalk at a reasonable speed is what makes sense. The scooters take up less space than bicycles. ""The global community of cities is going to have to figure this all out for scooters,"" Buttigieg said. ""These trends can move incredibly quickly. That's exciting, and a little scary.""",https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/15/technology/electric-scooters-bird/index.html
"In Portland, Scooter Start-Ups Played Nice. Regulators Took Note.",New York Times,,National,2019,1,15,"In Portland, Scooter Start-Ups Played Nice. Regulators Took Note. The e-scooter boom began in Santa Monica, Calif., about 16 months ago. Electric scooters, owned by start-ups looking to mimic the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber, appeared around town. The idea was simple: Use a smartphone app to rent a scooter and then leave it at the end of the ride for the next person. Soon, people in cities from San Francisco to Paris were complaining that the scooters were all over sidewalks — usually without the approval of local officials. In Portland, Ore., city officials worried that they would soon get their own flock of uninvited scooters. So they established a four-month pilot program in July with a limit on scooters and a requirement that companies share detailed data about trips and injuries with city officials. That data, released Tuesday by the city’s Bureau of Transportation, offers the most detailed analysis of the impact of e-scooters on a city. Scooters often replaced short car trips in Portland, offering some support for one of the biggest selling points the companies have made to communities: They can help reduce congestion and pollution. And the scooters did not lead to as many injuries as some had feared. But it is not yet clear if scooter companies can comply with different cities’ tight and varying limits and still run profitable local operations. The programs often cap the number of scooters and dictate which neighborhoods they ought to be in. “That is not letting the market determine how many scooters should be anywhere,” said Gabriel Scheer, Lime’s director of strategic development. “How do you unfetter us in a way that allows us to meet demand?” Still, Portland officials are using the pilot program to make a big point with start-ups: It is better to ask permission and work with local regulators than risk being run out of a community. That has not always been the case among start-ups trying to get a piece of the so-called sharing economy. Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft and the short-term rental company Airbnb have usually jumped into new markets before local regulators have had time to understand their businesses. For the scooter start-ups, not asking for permission has had consequences. After Lime and Bird began to operate without permission in San Francisco, the city instituted a permit system — but issued permits to only Skip and another smaller competitor, Scoot, effectively locking Lime and Bird out of the city. Some cities have simply impounded the scooters. Editors’ Picks My Best Friend Is Gone, and Nothing Feels Right How to Build a Better Dinner N.F.L. Week 5 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread “A lot of these companies roll into town, flout local regulations, see what they can get away with and how far they can push cities to accommodate them,” said Chloe Eudaly, a Portland city commissioner. “I feel like there is somewhat of a reversal of that trend among these companies and they are learning that’s not necessarily the best way to do business.” Other cities are establishing permit programs to limit the impact of unexpected scooter invasions. Washington, for example, said in November that companies could deploy no more than 600 scooters each, which Bird argued would make it “impossible” to provide full service. Bird, Lime and Skip received permits to operate in Portland. They handed over a wealth of data about scooter rides, giving city regulators access to information about where each trip started, the route it followed, where it ended and what time of day it occurred. Personal information on riders, such as payment data, was not shared. Portland capped the number of scooters at about 2,000, roughly divided among the three companies. Mr. Scheer, from Lime, said the cap system made it difficult to determine how many scooters a city actually needed. But he added that the limits forced scooter companies to hone their operations, offer scooters with smoother rides and ensure they were deployed in neighborhoods where they could draw the most riders. And the caps forced the start-ups to compete on how well they could comply with the city’s mandates rather than playing a numbers game. “We don’t think this is a land-grab type of business. This is one where you have to solve problems in a sustainable way,” said Sanjay Dastoor, the chief executive of Skip. “Having more vehicles on the road isn’t going to help if there aren’t places where people can ride them and feel safe.” The data that Portland collected allowed the city to assess whether e-scooters live up to their promises of reducing pollution and congestion. According to a citywide survey, 34 percent of residents who used the scooters and took a survey said they had used e-scooters to replace driving their own car or taking an Uber. City officials also had concerns about accessibility and safety, but saw low rates of injury and will continue to study those issues during a second test run. Some rules were meant to get the scooters into neighborhoods that could be underserved. One hundred scooters from each company had to be positioned in East Portland, a lower-income neighborhood with poor access to Portland’s public transit system. About 6 percent of the city’s rides originated in that neighborhood. Scooter start-ups didn’t always comply with restrictions, according to the report. The scooters often exceeded the speed limit of 15 miles an hour that the city had imposed, and none of the start-ups completely fulfilled their obligations to deploy scooters in East Portland. Over the four-month program, Portlanders took 700,369 scooter rides. Nineteen percent of those rides occurred between 3 and 6 p.m. on weekdays. But it was a small sample size compared with other cities. In Paris, which has no scooter cap, Lime alone provided more than a million rides over four months. When the Portland pilot effort ended in November, all of the e-scooters were cleared off the streets. The city is planning a second, yearlong pilot program in the spring but has not decided how many scooters it will allow, a spokesman said. “It seemed like a little bit of carnival on our streets for a while, but I think they definitely have potential to make our city easier to navigate for a lot of different people in different ways,” Ms. Eudaly said. She even took a ride on an e-scooter. “It was fun. It was easy,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/technology/electric-scooters-portland-oregon.html
"Scooter injuries are a thing, and they’re sending people to the ER",The Verge,Vox,National,2019,1,25,"Scooter injuries are a thing, and they’re sending people to the ER. ‘The problem is only going to get bigger.’ People are getting injured riding electric scooters — and most riders aren’t wearing helmets, new research says. The findings highlight the safety risks when infrastructure and regulation fail to keep up with a controversial and popular new transportation trend. Over the course of a year, at least 249 people visited two Southern California emergency rooms with broken bones, bumps, bruises, and head injuries — including brain bleeds — from scooter accidents, according to a paper published today in the journal JAMA Network Open. While most of the injuries were from riding the scooters, some pedestrians were injured when scooter riders crashed into them, and others tripped over scooters while walking. It’s the first comprehensive study to report the range of injuries resulting from the new scooter-sharing craze, and it could help scooter companies and cities figure out ways to prevent them. But actually implementing safety fixes could take a long time — just look at how communities have handled the introduction of bike lanes, or even sidewalks. The rise of motorized scooters kicked off in 2017 when hundreds of two-wheeled vehicles started appearing on city streets in California. People responded by tossing the scooters into bodies of water, outfitting them with seats, and, of course, riding them. These motorized scooters can reach speeds of 15 miles per hour — and faster speeds mean more chances for dangerous injuries, says Frederick Rivara, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. “This is what I expected to see, and it’s concerning,” says Rivara, who wrote an editorial about the study that was also published today. “The problem is only going to get bigger.” The research started when Tarak Trivedi, an ER doctor at UCLA and a research fellow at the National Clinician Scholars Program, started seeing the scooters popping up in Santa Monica. “They’re appearing everywhere, they’re controversial, people are shaking their fists at scooter riders as they ride by,” he says. Trivedi isn’t one of the fist-shakers — he actually rides scooters himself, always with a helmet. But, he adds, “it wasn’t long before I started seeing patients in the emergency department where I work at UCLA who had scooter-associated injuries.” Trivedi wanted to find out if there were any common trends to the injuries or the people coming in with them. That way, policymakers and scooter companies might be able to come up with strategies to prevent them. So he and his colleagues dug through a year’s worth of emergency room records at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica. They found 523 medical record entries containing the words “scooter,” “lime,” or “bird” starting in September 2017. (Lime and Bird are scooter startups.) Of those, 79 were thrown out because because “bird” or “lime” meant something else, “such as a name of a person or street or the animal or fruit,” the study says. Others were tossed because it was the wrong kind of scooter. In total, 249 records were explicitly about electric scooter injuries. The study doesn’t look at the rate of scooter injuries compared to say, rates of injuries from car accidents or bike crashes. They do report finding records for 195 bike accidents and 181 pedestrian injuries at those same hospitals. “We don’t know anything about miles ridden, or the number of rides taken, or the number of people who ride scooters on a daily basis,” Trivedi says. “At this point, it’s not clear whether or not riding them is more dangerous than riding bicycles.” That’s not what the study was investigating. Instead, the team looked at patterns in the scooter injuries, and they found that most of the patients were riding the scooter when they got hurt. (And 27 of the riders, or about 11 percent, were under age 18 — which goes against the scooter companies’ regulations, the study says.) The majority were injured by falling, but about 11 percent hit something, and another 8.8 percent were hit by a car or some other moving object. And people didn’t have to be riding the scooters to be injured by them, the team discovered: another 21 people were either hit by a scooter, fell over a parked scooter, or hurt themselves trying to lift one. About 40 percent of patients suffered head injuries, and several of those were especially serious — including five brain bleeds and a concussion. But the trouble with the hospital records was that they didn’t go into much detail about the nature of the rides themselves. About 12 noted the patients had been drinking, for example. And the records for only 10 patients, or 4.4 percent, explicitly said the patient had been wearing a helmet, for example. So to get a better sense for how people were using scooters, Trivedi and his team parked themselves on street corners to watch 193 people scooting by. “We saw all kinds of things,” Trivedi says: there were tandem riders, parent-child pairs, people riding on sidewalks and ignoring traffic laws. And 94 percent weren’t wearing helmets. Although the scooter company Bird supported California legislation to make helmet use optional for adult riders, according to CNET, that didn’t go into effect until January 1st of this year. At the time, those bare-headed riders were flouting local law. That’s why Rivara thinks scooter companies should start figuring out ways to give people easy access to helmets. But he adds that while bike helmets certainly reduce the risk of injury, they may not be enough at higher speeds: “Since these things are motorized, we don’t really know whether bicycle helmets will be adequate or not,” he says. He’s hoping that the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission gets involved with testing bike helmets at scooter speeds. “I realize that there’s not an easy solution — if there was, we would have done it — but nevertheless that doesn’t mean you should ignore it,” he says. Trivedi speculates that poor scooter maintenance could contribute to injuries. Although the study didn’t look into it, he’s heard patients complain of equipment failures, like problems with the brakes. He recommends riders test their scooters’ brakes before hopping on, and that companies make it easier to report damaged scooters. Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy for scooter startup Bird, says in an emailed statement that they hope to work with the study authors going forward. “Bird did not have the opportunity to work with the study’s authors or to collaborate with them, and we find the report to be very limited,” he says. He, like Trivedi, points out that the study doesn’t look at the rate of accidents compared to motorcycle or car accidents. “The number of injuries reported would amount to a fraction of one percent of the total number of e-scooter rides.” (Since scooter rides tend to be short, however, injuries per mile might be a better comparison.) In an emailed statement, Mary Caroline Pruitt, a spokesperson for Lime, says safety is the company’s first priority. She listed company safety initiatives, including “250,000 free helmets distributed to riders across the globe,” she says. “We’re also working with local governments around the world to support infrastructure for shared scooters and bikes.” After all, the responsibility for rider safety doesn’t rest solely with the companies; Trivedi also wishes cities would make roads safer for both cyclists and scooter riders by keeping roads maintained and setting aside space in traffic for non-car vehicles like bicycles and scooters. “Scooters go 15 miles per hour, so it’s a recipe for disaster if you don’t dedicate a space on the road,” he says. For Trivedi, the findings haven’t dissuaded him from riding electric scooters. But he’s going to keep wearing his helmet, no matter how annoying it may be to lug it around restaurants and movie theaters. “If anything, I’d say I’m pro-scooter,” he says. Aside, of course, from the injuries. “We just have to use them really safely.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197523/scooter-injuries-bird-lime-la-california-emergency-room-concussion-helmet
Scooters: The Next Public Health Issue?,U.S. News,,National,2019,1,25,"Scooters: The Next Public Health Issue? An analysis of related injuries found low rates of adherence to existing regulations around rider age and helmet use. Injuries from standing electric scooters present a potential public health issue as their use and popularity rise, according to a new study published in JAMA Friday. In a retrospective analysis, University of California–Los Angeles researchers examined medical records for standing electric scooter injuries at two associated emergency departments between Sept. 1, 2017, and Aug. 31, 2018. They found a total of 249 patient cases ranging in severity, with head injuries (40.2 percent), fractures (31.7) and contusions, sprains and lacerations without fracture or head injury (27.7) to be the most common injuries. Further, these scooter-linked injuries surpassed bicyclist (195) and pedestrian (181) injuries in the scooters' first year on the streets, the authors found in a post hoc analysis. ""Many thousands of riders are now using standing electric scooters daily on U.S. streets shared with millions of pedestrians and drivers,"" the study says. ""Understanding the impact of rising scooter use on public health is more important than ever."" Some local laws require the use of helmets when riding standing scooters, ""but no uniform set of policies exists,"" with enforcement varying by location, according to the report. Study authors found only 10 riders out of the 249 patients were wearing a helmet, and 12 patients were intoxicated or had a blood alcohol level greater than 0.05 percent. Further, while the majority of patients were between the ages of 18 and 40, about 10 percent of patients treated were younger than 18, the minimum age scooter companies like Bird Rides and Lime permit for use. In addition, they documented a total of 193 electric scooter riders during three public observation sessions in the community surrounding the two hospitals in September 2018 and found 94.3 percent of riders were not wearing helmets and nearly 10 percent failed to comply with traffic laws. ""This suggests that current self-enforced regulations imposed by private electric scooter companies may be inadequate,"" the study says, Dr. Frederick Rivara, University of Washington Medicine’s chief of General Pediatrics, pointed to the lack of helmets documented among people presenting scooter-related injury as a major cause for concern in an associated commentary piece. ""None of the companies that rent these vehicles in the increasingly common hubless system provide helmets,"" he wrote. ""The presence of so many unhelmeted users of 2-wheeled vehicles may provide an example to bicycle riders to also forgo helmet use, potentially undoing two decades of work to increase helmet use by bicyclists."" Authors note that improved documentation, such as helmet use and injuries involving scooters, in medical records as well as an examination of outpatient visits to urgent care or primary care clinics for minor injuries would improve the results, which they believe underestimate the extent of the occurrence of injuries and health care costs. ""This rapidly expanding technology is a disruptive force in short-distance transportation, and policy makers seeking to understand associated risks and appropriate regulatory responses should seriously consider its effects on public health,"" the study notes. ""Riders share roads with fast moving vehicular traffic but appear to underestimate hazards.""

Electric Scooters And Micro-Mobility: Here's Everything You Need To Know,Forbes,,National,2019,2,1,"Electric Scooters And Micro-Mobility: Here's Everything You Need To Know. The rise of micro-mobility companies has been well documented over the last few years with companies like Ofo and Mobike in China and Citi Bike and Jump Bikes in the US providing consumers with convenient options for last-mile transportation. All these companies have gone on to raise venture capital or be acquired, showcasing both the consumer and investor demand for last-mile transportation solutions. In 2018, this micro-mobility trend was re-energized with the emergence of the shared and dockless electric scooter (e-scooter for short), pioneered by Lime and Bird in the US. These e-scooters quickly found such strong product-market fit that Bird and Lime became the fastest ever US companies to reach billion dollar valuations, with each achieving this milestone within a year of inception. The trend of e-scooter companies quickly scaling into large companies has continued into 2019 with Grin and Yellow announcing a merger to form the strongest micro-mobility competitor in LatAm less than a year after they were founded. (Disclosure: Base10 is an investor in Grin and Yellow). Moreover, additional e-scooter companies from all over the world - Skip, Spin, Scoot, PopScoot, Beam, Tier Mobility, Wind Mobility, Voi Technology, Vogo, Dott, and Flash - all recently announced large capital raises. In Europe alone, five e-scooter companies have emerged and raised over $150 million of capital since the start of 2018. However, negative headlines about e-scooters ending up in lakes and oceans, congesting sidewalks, being stolen, causing injuries, and experiencing intense competition have tempered the narrative and suggest e-scooters are not the best micro-mobility option after all. There is even talk of a “scootergeddon.” Despite all the positive funding news and frequent use by consumers, plenty of questions remain about the viability of e-scooters as a long-term micro-mobility solution. Do cities need electric scooters? Megacities worldwide are facing an epidemic of congestion and pollution caused by rapid urbanization that is increasing gridlock and putting severe pressure on public transportation systems. 46% of car traffic in the US is caused by cars on trips less than three miles and micro-mobility solutions could help alleviate a significant portion of this last-mile gridlock. Data from INRIX suggests the average commuter in the US spent 42 hours in traffic congestion in 2014. But do cities actually want e-scooters, or other micro-mobility solutions? It depends which city you ask. However, what most cities agree with is that e-scooters, electric bikes, and pedal bikes, whether docked or dockless, are viable solutions to help alleviate traffic congestion, especially at rush hours, and they are excited about that. (Note: based on multiple conversations with senior MTA officials across the country). The main concerns with micro-mobility vehicles, and e-scooters in particular, are safety and whether cities current infrastructure can support the massive influx of these vehicles. Common questions include “how do we keep the e-scooters from being parked where we don’t want them?” and ”how do we modify our bike lanes to keep e-scooter riders and bike riders safe while also keeping enough sidewalk space for pedestrians?” Most of the large micro-mobility companies have been working with cities to address these concerns including using electronic geo-zones to prevent riders from either riding in an unsafe area or parking in an area where the city doesn’t want them to park (this could also be used to prevent people from riding on sidewalks), and e-scooter companies require riders to be 18 years or older and with a valid driver's license scanned before you can open an account. Additionally, municipal transportation data companies like Remix and Swiftly, who help cities plan bus routes and track their vehicles in real time, are beginning to develop products and dashboards for transportation authorities to track and analyze all micro-mobility vehicles across platforms to see where they all are located, where the broken ones are, and where their use is being concentrated at any given time. It will take time and a track record of safety and compliance, which is not guaranteed, for most cities to believe micro-mobility companies do better good than harm, but through data, cooperation, and intelligent regulation, the chances that cities become more open to these solutions should increase. Do people actually like e-scooters as much as they like other micro-mobility solutions? Docked bikes, dockless bikes, and e-bikes are all popular last-mile transportation methods. However, if you have been to Santa Monica or San Diego on a sunny day, you would have seen hundreds of locals and visitors race to find any open e-scooter before going to a nearby dockless bike. Data from Lime showing how fast they reached one million and six million e-scooter rides sheds some light on the product-market fit of e-scooters, especially when compared with rideshare over a similar point in each solutions lifecycle. Additionally, 30% of riders report using e-scooters to replace car rides on their most recent trip, signaling the positive impact micro-mobility solutions can have on reducing congestion. Micro-mobility and e-scooter demand is also not exclusive to the US. As noted above, Tier Mobility, Wind Mobility, Voi Technology, Dott, and Flash are all European based e-scooter startups who have recently raised more than $150 million over the last several months alone. Part of the reason they have been able to raise such large amounts of capital is due to Lime and Bird’s success in European cities like Paris, Madrid, London, and Vienna. But are they safe? It is being reported that ER rooms are seeing an uptick in e-scooter related injuries, but the reports also say most are due to rider neglect such as multi-riders on one e-scooter or riders using their phone while riding. To combat this, e-scooter companies have safety videos on their website and there is also a safety tutorial when riders first sign up for each app and safety instructions clearly labeled on the e-scooters themselves. Accident rates will likely decline as riders become more familiar with e-scooters, especially when considering they have only been on the streets for a year. Aren’t theft and vandalism a big problem for dockless micro-mobility solutions? Currently, yes. Vandalism and theft are a byproduct of placing hundreds of dockless micro-mobility vehicles across major cities. However, micro-mobility companies are seeing a decline in theft and vandalism as they move to negate the problem. To date, most of this has come from innovative oversight efforts and anticipating where issues are likely to occur. In the future, technological advances around security that incorporate things like remote monitors and improved locking systems should further help alleviate the problem. Can e-scooter companies be profitable? Early e-scooter unit economics have been inconsistent and subject to seasonality, so it is too early to say one way or another. However, previously announced tech innovations by some manufacturers should help to reduce unit costs and increase useful life. The most important of these tech innovations seem to be: Increased battery life and / or interchangeable rechargeable batteries, which will significantly reduce the cost of juicers. Sturdier e-scooters with better materials, efficient construction, and larger wheels which will increase e-scooter life by a factor of 2x or more. Since Bird put the first e-scooters on the streets at the beginning of 2018, the vast majority of shared e-scooters have been manufactured by Segway, a subsidiary of Chinese hardware manufacturer Xiaomi, and InMotion. Xiaomi and InMotion e-scooters, however, were not initially designed to be shared and have enjoyed a near duopoly in the industry which has deterred either from spending significant R&D on e-scooter innovation. This is changing as new entrants are offering improved models. These new entrants should kick start innovation and competition among manufacturers that will hopefully increase scooter life and unit economics as a result. So why don’t Uber and Lyft just dominate micro-mobility? They’re certainly trying. Uber bought Jump Bikes and invested in Lime and was recently rumored to be in acquisition talks with Bird while Lyft bought Citi Bike and has already launched their own e-scooters and is currently operating across several US cities. However, despite what Lyft and Uber eventually do, there remains an opportunity for the larger independent micro-mobility companies to leverage their operating experience into an advantage against the rideshare competitors as municipal transportation authorities will likely emphasize certain characteristics in the micro-mobility partners they choose to work with. These include: Recognized by users as a dependable last-mile transport alternative and with operations in many cities across geographies. Unique experience operating complex e-scooter or dockless bike networks where they are learning how to increase safety and efficiency in real time (something Uber or Lyft can only replicate with the requisite experience). Pre-existing relationships with other regulatory authorities who can validate their ability to operate successfully and safely in cities across the world. Nonetheless, even if the large independent micro-mobility companies possess these characteristics, there is certainly a strong argument that the endgame for all the independent micro-mobility players is to combine and / or partner with rideshare companies or risk losing significant market share. The idea of a consumer being able to open their Uber or Lyft app and compare ride times and cost against an Uber car ride, Jump Bike ride, or e-scooter ride all from one app is a very powerful idea. One more thing...this might actually be all about payments? ""The next phase of micro-mobility is meeting the localized needs of the mass market consumer with new services like payments and food delivery,” said Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV Capital, an investor in Grow, Grab, Lime, Hello Chuxing, and Didi who has seen this strategy play out around the world. Micro-mobility companies like Grin and Yellow in unbanked and underbanked countries are offering convenient digital wallets and digital payment functionality. These companies will allow customers to purchase ride credits with cash, usually at a discount, and then allow them to use these ride credits for other purchases and payments like utility bills, shops, and restaurants, as well as for money transfers between friends. Similar to past examples, it is possible the winners of the micro-mobility wars in under and unbanked populations will have an opportunity to build a large financial business on top of their micro-mobility businesses. There have been several examples of high adoption consumer platforms in similar geographies that have created payment platforms and been incredibly successful. Two prominent examples are Alipay, which was incubated by Alibaba, and GrabPay, which was incubated by Grab. GrabPay has been a huge catalyst for SE Asia rideshare company Grab, which recently raised $1B from Toyota at a $10B valuation. Grab Co-founder, Hooi Ling Tan, said in June she expects GrabPay to eventually generate 20x the revenue for Grab that rideshare does. The highly engaged and frequent user base of the leading micro-mobility companies holds enormous potential for the emergence of payment solutions on top of these platforms. In conclusion, no matter what side of the micro-mobility and e-scooter argument you fall on, the data indicates society needs a viable last-mile alternative to the current transportation options that are congesting and polluting the world’s most populous cities. Time will tell if the best last-mile alternative ends up being e-scooters, dockless bikes, or some new form of transportation yet to hit the streets.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/adeyemiajao/2019/02/01/everything-you-want-to-know-about-scooters-and-micro-mobility/
How Dangerous Are Electric Scooters? [Infographic],Forbes,,National,2019,2,4,"How Dangerous Are Electric Scooters? [Infographic]. Electric scooters, known as e-scooters, are one of the hottest trends sweeping the nation. They are light, compact and ideal for quickly traversing busy urban areas, particularly when used in conjunction with public transport. In many U.S. cities, riders have purchased their own scooters while a network of rental companies such as Bird, Skip and Lime offer them for as little as $1 with a few cents added on for each minute of usage. While the zippy new scooters may seem like a dream for commuters, they can prove extremely dangerous for inexperienced riders navigating through rush hour traffic. There are no official numbers on e-scooter deaths, though fatal accidents are known to have occurred in several cities around the world including Los Angeles, London and Singapore. Given safety fears and a lack of data about the severity of accidents, U.S. researchers have published a new study about injuries from e-scooter mishaps for the first time. The analysis was conducted by the University of California Los Angeles and published in medical journal the JAMA Network Open. It focused on two emergency departments from Sept. 1, 2017 to Aug. 31, 2018, finding that 249 people involved in e-scooter accidents required medical care with a third of them transported to hospital by ambulance. The most common accidents noted were falls, collisions with objects and riders getting struck by a moving vehicle or object. 40% of the resulting injuries were bone fractures, with head trauma also noted in 31.7% of cases. 27.7% involved cuts, sprains and bruises. Perhaps most notably, the study found that only 4.4% of riders were wearing a helmet when their accident occurred. Even though most e-scooter companies recommend people wear a helmet, there seems to be a low adherence to the most basic safety protocols. This, coupled with the increasing number of e-bikes in circulation, is leading to greater public uproar and scrutiny. Today there are an estimated 65,000 e-scooters on American streets and questions about their safety has led to talk of a ban unless proper safety guidelines are followed. As the discussion gets louder, the days of an unhelmeted rider listening to music on AirPods and sipping a coffee to go as he or she zips by at 25 mph could thankfully be numbered.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/02/04/how-dangerous-are-electric-scooters-infographic/
Electric Scooters Are Popping Up in Cities Across the Country. But Are They Safe?,Time,,National,2019,2,5,"Electric Scooters Are Popping Up in Cities Across the Country. But Are They Safe? University of Texas star baseball shortstop David Hamilton hit a pothole riding an electric scooter, tearing his Achilles tendon and requiring surgery. He’ll miss the season. Cristal Glangchai, the CEO for a nonprofit, hit a rock riding her scooter, landing her on the pavement just blocks from home. “I lost control and ended up getting a concussion and a broken rib,” said Glangchai, a 41-year-old mother of four. And Austin’s first scooter-related death occurred over the weekend. Police identified the scooter rider as Mark Sands, a 21-year-old UT student from Ireland, who died Saturday, just one day after suffering critical injuries when the electric scooter he was riding collided with a car. As many as 14,000 dockless electric scooters are on the streets of Austin, whose 326 square miles are home to almost 1 million people. That likely makes Austin one of the cities with the highest scooter-to-citizen ratio in the nation — though the electric vehicles are also rapidly multiplying on the streets and sidewalks of Atlanta, San Diego, Nashville and Washington. Scooter rental companies are proliferating in Austin and across the country. Ten companies have licenses to operate now within Austin, and at least 1,200 more electric scooters are poised to appear in Austin whenever already-licensed operators deploy them. But city leaders and citizens, in Austin and nationwide, are worried about injuries for both users and pedestrians. “We’re totally paranoid,” said Forrest Preece, a retired advertising executive who lives in a downtown condo and leads a largely pedestrian life. “I’m 72 and my wife is 70. It would be easy to knock us over,” he said. “My wife actually went online and found a little mirror to attach to her wrist to look behind her so she’s not constantly turning around. We go single file so she can see that mirror and see what’s behind us.” These zippy, colorful motorized scooters, which are rented with a smartphone app and dropped off almost anywhere, are hard to resist. The companies behind them — Bird, Bolt, Lime, Scoot, Skip and Spin, among others — promote them as smart, low-cost transportation alternatives for short distances, especially in cities. Neither Bird nor Lime responded to multiple interview requests. They’re likely to overwhelm the city this spring as Austin readies for an onslaught of scooter-riding visitors during the annual SXSW Conference & Festivals, running March 8-17. Last year’s SXSW drew 432,500 people. Data on scooter-related injuries are collected by the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), but the category also includes skateboards and hoverboards, which account for the bulk of the injuries in the most recent data from 2017 — well before scooters proliferated across the country. So far, what’s believed to be the first published study examining scooter injuries was released in January in JAMA Network Open, a peer-reviewed medical journal. UCLA researchers studied 249 patients (228 scooter riders and 21 pedestrians) treated at two emergency departments over a year’s time. Head injuries and fractures were the most common diagnosis. Among scooter riders, 80% were injured in a fall, 11% collided with an object and almost 9% were hit by a moving vehicle or object. For almost 5% of patients, intoxication was a factor. Just 4% of riders wore a helmet. Such findings don’t surprise physicians. “We’re seeing five to six minor injuries a week, almost one a day — hand and arm fractures, broken bones and facial injuries, such as scrapes and bumps and fractures,” said Dr. Oscar Guillamondegui, trauma ICU medical director at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “Approximately one to two major traumatic brain injuries a month are admitted to the trauma center. The reason is simple. Who’s carrying a helmet? No one. No one is wearing them because no one is carrying them.” Guillamondegui will appear this week on a panel dubbed a “community conversation about scooters in Nashville” as that city mulls more regulation. In Atlanta, the number of injuries per month has increased from about 30 to about 100, said Dr. Hany Atallah, chief of emergency medicine at Grady Health System, which includes Grady Memorial Hospital, the largest hospital in Georgia. Grady, which is among the nation’s busiest Level 1 trauma centers, is looking at the rise and scope of scooter injuries as a new internal project. “I’m concerned people are riding these things without helmets and on roads in busier traffic,” he said. “As opposed to motorcycles, these wheels are pretty small. Certainly, hitting a pothole can send someone over.” Cities are trying to balance the electric scooter as a boost to mobility with ensuring the safety of riders who travel amid motorists and pedestrians. There are plenty of reports of pedestrians tripping or falling over parked scooters, as well as tales of being hit by moving scooters. A handful of scooter-related deaths occurred last year: one each in Dallas, Washington, D.C., Chula Vista, Calif., and Cleveland. Some cities have introduced regulations that include banning the scooters, regulating the numbers allowed on the streets and specifying where they can park or ride. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the City Commission this week plans to evaluate its dockless mobility permit program and consider adjustments that could enhance safety, spokeswoman Dayana Diaz said. Officials in Portland, Ore., decided in January to conduct a second scooter pilot program this spring studying the impact of e-scooters on the city. This one will last a year, following a July through November study that found 176 people went to emergency rooms with scooter injuries. Of those, 84% fell from a scooter and 90% of riders didn’t wear a helmet. As electric scooters multiply around the country and the world, a survey of 7,000 people in 11 major U.S. cities by the San Francisco-based data platform Populus found that 70% of those surveyed had a positive view of scooters. Atlanta placed first, with 79% of its residents in the positive category. Austin was a close second, at 76%. Now, at the request of Austin city leaders, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating scooter-related crashes and injuries. The first-ever CDC scooter study will also look at how accidents could be prevented. The scooter study was launched in December when three CDC epidemiologists spent two weeks in Austin reviewing incidents and scooter-related injuries during a 60-day period from September to November. They began contacting the 258 individuals identified through EMS calls or who visited emergency rooms with a scooter-related injury. Findings from this study will likely be released in March and could have far-reaching effects as cities across the country grapple with reports of injuries from these e-scooters. “We don’t know if there’s something unique about Austin or the population there that may be different from other parts of the United States or globally,” said Eric Pevzner, chief of the Atlanta-based CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service, which is conducting the probe. “The rate of scooter injuries in Austin may be consistent with what’s being noticed in other places, or it may be much higher.” The CDC Austin study will calculate injuries per number of scooters ridden and per mile traveled. As researchers speak with those hurt, they’ll ask about road conditions, street types, weather, helmet use and behaviors, including alcohol use while riding. While the study continues, Austin’s transportation department announced a “pause” in issuing new licenses to dockless mobility operators to assess the level of demand for those currently licensed and to ensure safety. The city is also reviewing its current rules and expects to revise the scooter rider ordinance this spring. And, with the start of a new semester at UT-Austin, university officials announced new rules and fines for scooter use and indicated more changes are ahead, including dropping scooter speed limits on campus from 15 mph to 8 mph. Glangchai, the injured CEO, said she’ll now “always wear a helmet and be a little more cautious” when she resumes riding following a six-week doctor-ordered hiatus. “Scooters empower people. It seems so easy to hop on and press go,” she said. “It seems like it’s easier to take more risks on a scooter. They’re great because you get around places quickly, but it’s almost like it’s too easy for people to hop on and go fast.”",https://time.com/5521308/electric-scooter-safety/
How We're Solving The Shared Scooter Theft Problem,Forbes,,National,2019,2,7,"How We're Solving The Shared Scooter Theft Problem. Vandalism. Theft. Dumping. Rough handling. These are all challenges recognized by every player in the micro mobility game, whether we’re discussing electric scooters or dockless bikes. The question continues to be asked: are dockless scooters and bikes feasible as a business, and is there a silver bullet for these challenges? There are some similarities between these challenges for dockless micro mobility devices and Hardin’s famous Tragedy of the Commons; e-scooters and e-bikes are the “resource” that is “commonly held” but only in the sense that they are unsecured and can be taken by anyone. Abuse of this resource in terms of degree and method varies, but what’s common is that seems to come down to whim. There’s no perceived cost to the abuser, so they feel free to do what they will. And the crime feels victimless, or even justified as it damages large faceless companies like Bird and Lime. It’s also arguable that some of the vandalism is a result of frustration felt by non-customers who come across the devices scattered across a sidewalk, blocking the way. The big micro mobility operators have been addressing these challenges with a variety of measures. Scoot, for example, is tackling the theft problem by requiring riders to use a cable lock to secure their kick scooters to a railing or post after a ride. This goes a little further than requiring a rider to take a photo of their scooter to prove it’s been parked properly, which is in and of itself a good practice to help keep sidewalks clear. Scoot’s locks are controlled through their app, so there is no fussing with a combination. Scoot’s CEO recognizes that this won’t completely eliminate theft or vandalism of their scooters, but will reduce the amount of abuse enough to keep Scoot sustainable over the long-term. The e-scooters do have built-in anti-theft systems. If you don’t pay for the ride, the device locks up and the rider is unable to use the scooter. Lime ran into some trouble with that just recently in Switzerland, where there were reports of scooters rebooting during a ride, which triggered the immobilization systems. This caused some accidents and injuries, which forced Lime to pull their entire fleet out of the cities of Basel and Zurich. Despite this, immobilization systems are a no-brainer as a method of protecting dockless scooters from theft. Again, it’s a mitigating factor as opposed to an absolute solution, but it adds to the weight against theft and vandalism. There are other measures being used by the big operators. Last year it was reported that Lime had an alarm system that loudly announced it would contact police. The device was not met with much appreciation, and Lime has since deactivated the audible warning, presumably leaving an alarm inside the scooter to notify their office that a scooter was being used without authorization. Despite all of the gloom we hear about “scooter abuse”, Lime reported in 2018 that less than 1% of their scooters had been vandalized nationwide in the U.S. Knowing this number creates a much clearer picture of the viability of a micro mobility business, especially for one that is community-based, where the fleet owner carefully hand-picks the neighbourhoods to be served. What is clear in the maelstrom that is the current micro mobility space is that while the less admirable facets of human behaviour are at play, solutions to discourage and mitigate said behaviour are evolving rapidly. Beyond hardware and software, the ultimate solution might be social: when a community as a whole realizes that these electric devices are used by their neighbours and friends to get to work or school, and they rely on them daily. Owning scooters and e-bikes on a micro mobility network is a natural extension of the already existing (and growing!) gig economy, where people use their own assets to create revenue, such as ride-hailing with Uber and renting accommodations with AirBnB. Riders love the experience provided by e-scooters. The business model is viable. Theft and abuse will always occur, but there are measures that ameliorate the problem, measures that continue to evolve. We can have nice things, and micro mobility is here to stay.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnfrazer1/2019/02/07/how-were-solving-the-shared-scooter-theft-problem/
What Safety Risks Do Electric Scooters Pose?,PCMag,,National,2019,2,18,"What Safety Risks Do Electric Scooters Pose? The Xiaomi scooter hack has drawn more attention to the danger of injury while riding e-scooters. A lot can go wrong when you're going 15 mph without a helmet. What would you do if your e-scooter came to an abrupt stop in the middle of the street? A group of researchers from mobile security company Zimperium recently showed how the popular Xiaomi M365 electric scooter can be remotely hacked to accelerate or disable a scooter without warning, leaving the rider in serious danger. Xiaomi is working on a software update to address the flaw, but the vulnerability is a sobering reminder that these newer forms of last-mile transportation can carry significant safety risks if you're not careful. According to a study on the injuries associated with standing electric scooter use conducted by UCLA researchers and published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open, injuries can range from cuts and sprains to broken bones and head trauma. The UCLA researchers studied 249 patients who were brought into two Southern California emergency departments between September 2017 and August 2018. A third of those patients were brought to the hospitals via ambulance. The most common e-scooter accident by far at 80.2 percent was simply falling off the scooter. Eleven percent of patients were involved in a collision with an object, while 8.8 percent of patients were hit by a moving vehicle or object while riding an e-scooter. Due to the nature of the study observing only hospital patients, the data skews toward more serious injuries. Of the 249 patients, 40.2 percent sustained bone fractures, and 31.7 percent experienced head trauma. Only 27.7 percent of the injuries treated were more minor cuts, bruises, and sprains, but it's worth noting that countless more minor e-scooter injuries and collisions over that time frame likely did not require medical attention. Ride-sharing electric scooters are a cheap, convenient way to get around more and more urban areas across the country, but the vast majority of riders could certainly stand to be safer about it. In the most telling stat revealed in the study, only 4.4 percent of patients who ended up in the hospital for an e-scooter injury were wearing helments.",https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-safety-risks-do-electric-scooters-pose
"Could electric scooters like Bird, Lime help ease traffic congestion, save riders money?",USA Today,USA Today,National,2019,2,21,"Could electric scooters like Bird, Lime help ease traffic congestion, save riders money? In the rush to demonize electric scooters as dangerous nuisances, we might be missing an opportunity. Transportation experts say scooters could be part of a solution to relieve urban congestion and address global warming. Scooters could also help riders save money and arrive at the office without needing to hit the showers. For example, say you have an important meeting 3 miles away, but city streets are jammed with motionless cars. Uber or Lyft would also sit in traffic and could easily cost $15. Instead, you rent a nearby electric scooter for $1 to start and 15 cents a minute. You cruise past cars and arrive in time for your meeting. Total cost: $3. Environmental impact: infinitesimal. Bumpy ride so far Dockless electric scooters, so-called because riders can leave them wherever their trip ends, began popping up in cities nationwide in 2018. With a smartphone app, riders locate and unlock rental scooters (offered by companies with zippy names like Bird, Lime, Scoot, Jump and Razor) making for a great solution for a gridlocked city. Right? Wrong. With fellow urbanites annoyed by scooter riders dive bombing pedestrians and leaving scooters strewn across sidewalks, an internet sensation emerged: Scooter haters finding new ways – including set to music on YouTube – to destroy them. “But any time you see someone on a scooter, they aren’t in a car and we should be hugging and kissing them for that,” says Jim McPherson, a San Francisco Bay area lawyer specializing in transportation technology. He says both human-propelled and motorized scooters were popular a century ago, while the current electric scooter rental boom is thanks to powerful lithium-ion batteries and GPS connectivity. An affordable answer to congestion? Scooters are an attractive addition to the transportation matrix since they travel the same speed as cyclists and in many cities can use the bike lanes already built, Heather Hamilton, an elected official in Brookline, Massachusetts, and a transportation-focused project manager with engineering firm BSC Group, tells NerdWallet. Scooters “could be one puzzle piece” in efforts to attain carbon neutrality, Hamilton wrote in a recent Boston Globe opinion piece. On the topic of inner city congestion, “it’s clear we can’t drive our way out of this problem,” says Alissa Walker, urbanism editor for real estate site Curbed. Instead, she says we need “micro-mobility,” a variety of small, lightweight transportation devices, like electric scooters and bikes. Scooter sharing services also could save riders money. A recent study estimated that a 3-mile journey in Chicago’s traffic would cost $6 in a car versus $5.07 by scooter. The study by DePaul University was partially funded by scooter company Bird. Road to acceptance Walker believes scooters are really just a “part of a suite of options for helping people get around,” she says. For example, Uber’s app now also connects you with bikes and scooters through partnerships with Jump and Lime. “You open up your phone and you see that this method (of transportation) will take this long and cost this much and be zero emissions,” Walker says. “You can gauge your decision based on the information in front of you.” Although electric scooters, which cost $350-$500, are cheaper than cars, they fill a different need and likely won’t replace cars for most people. However, easy access to scooters could mean driving less. Over time, that could help reduce one’s total car ownership costs, which include gas, parking, maintenance and insurance. And whether scooter haters like it or not, the urban transportation market is exploding. Bird scooters are available in over 100 cities, including Paris and Tel Aviv, Israel. Meanwhile, Lyft introduced scooters in a test program in Denver and bought the country’s biggest bike-share operator, Motivate. Scoot, bike or drive? Experts say electric scooters offer a number of advantages over other forms of transportation: Cheaper. With rides starting at about $1, electric scooters are much less expensive than driving, paying for gas and parking. User-friendly. They’re easier to get on and off compared with a bike. Effortless. You don’t work up a sweat. Less hassle. You can park almost anywhere (but don’t block sidewalks). But there are drawbacks: More risks. Electric scooter sharing has a higher rate of fatal injuries compared with bike sharing. Best for short jaunts. They’re less efficient for trips over 3 miles. Costs can rise. All-day rentals get pricey. You have to go to it. You have to walk to a scooter rather than being picked up (but soon, scooters might be delivered to you). In the rapidly evolving world of mobility, the electric scooter, used responsibly, seems to have a place. But as Walker says, “Next year they’ll have some other new device that everyone is talking about.”",https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/02/21/electric-scooters-could-bird-lime-rentals-ease-traffic-congestion/2926267002/
Electric scooters add a buzz to city sightseeing,USA Today,USA Today,National,2019,2,22,"Electric scooters add a buzz to city sightseeing. The latest way to sightsee requires an app, a sense of balance and a thumb to operate a throttle. Dockless electric scooters are a great way to explore a city, says Paul DeMaio, who manages the bike- and scooter-share programs in Arlington, Virginia. “It can be a lot of fun.” In some areas the programs, which offer short-term rentals for just a few dollars, have been controversial: Parked scooters can block sidewalks, and inexperienced, unhelmeted riders have been injured. But cities have adopted regulations, and the popularity is booming. “It’s surprising how quickly they have caught on and spread,” says DeMaio. He shares some scenic places to scoot with Larry Bleiberg for USA TODAY. Santa Monica, California This beachfront city was one of the first to regulate scooters and dockless bikes. A special slow zone caps scooter speeds on the busy boardwalk, and the city also has painted-off corrals to park the vehicles and keep them from cluttering up the waterfront. “It’s one of the very first scootershares in the country,” DeMaio says. santamonica.com Paris One of the world’s top tourism cities has embraced the electric scooter, giving visitors and residents a breezy alternative to the Metro. But the vehicles are only allowed on streets and bike paths. The trottinettes, as they’re called in French, aren’t left out to litter the sidewalks, either. As in most places, the entire fleet is picked up every evening and redistributed around the city by the next morning. en.parisinfo.com Washington Already home to a successful bike-share program, the nation’s capital has gone all-in for scooters. “D.C. was pretty welcoming early on,” DeMaio says. But visitors do need to know the regulations: The vehicles aren’t allowed on sidewalks in the central business district, which includes the National Mall and the White House area, and speeds are capped. washington.org Denver The Mile High City offers plenty of scooter choices, providing another option for visitors to make their way to the booming city’s food halls, museums and parks. New regulations ban the vehicles from most sidewalks and the city’s 16th Street pedestrian mall. The growing usage may be coming at the expense of the city’s bike-share program, which has seen a drop in riders. denver.org San Francisco While cable cars remain the city’s transportation icon, scooters have caught on with both residents and visitors. Still, the city has played hardball with the scooter industry, only allowing two companies to operate in the municipality, although that’s under appeal. “They were looking for the best actors out there in terms of those willing to work with the city,” DeMaio says. sanfrancisco.travel Charlottesville, Virginia This historic college town has quickly adapted to scooters, which first arrived in the fall. They provide an easy way to zip around commercial areas, and on streets through the scenic University of Virginia grounds. Regulations require the vehicles to stay off sidewalks, and limit usage in pedestrian-heavy areas like the Downtown Mall and the college’s Lawn area. visitcharlottesville.org Tel Aviv, Israel Scooters have taken off in Israel’s largest city, traffic-choked and tech-focused Tel Aviv. Riders are required to wear a helmet and restricted to bike trails, although they’re permitted on streets where no paths are available. Popular with weekday commuters, the vehicles are also often used for outings to the city’s Mediterranean beaches. Rentals climb on the Jewish Sabbath, when the city’s public transportation doesn’t operate. goisrael.com Austin, Texas The Lone Star State capital has scooter fever with thousands on the streets, and more than a half-dozen providers licensed to operate. The city even has designated scooter parking zones. “It’s one of the largest (programs) in the country,” DeMaio says. One company, Ojo, plans to offer Vespa-style sit-down scooters with Bluetooth-enabled speakers. austintexas.gov/docklessmobility Charlotte, North Carolina North Carolina’s largest city has embraced the e-scooter, but bans them from sidewalks in the Uptown area and limits vehicle speeds. Rental companies require riders to be over 18, and to have a driver’s license. charlottesgotalot.com Portland, Oregon When reports began pouring in from other cities about sidewalks being overrun with scooters, Portland took a cautious approach, authorizing a four-month pilot last year. But scooters were so well-accepted, the city has plans to welcome the vehicles again this year. “Cities are trying to protect the public and limit the negative impacts as much as possible,” DeMaio says. travelportland.com",https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2019/02/22/dockless-electric-scooters/2909656002/
"Lime scooter riders are being injured by ‘sudden excessive braking,’ company says",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,2,25,"Lime scooter riders are being injured by ‘sudden excessive braking,’ company says. The company says anyone riding its scooters should exercise extreme caution. Lime, one of the world’s largest electric scooter companies, is urging riders to be extra cautious while operating its devices because of a technical “bug” that can cause “sudden excessive braking during use,” the company announced in a statement over the weekend. The company said testing has revealed that the sudden braking usually arises when scooters are being ridden downhill at top speed. The danger prompted Lime to issue remote updates aimed at fixing the glitch, which have led to a reduction in the number of braking incidents, the company said. But the company is still urging riders to give brakes a “tight squeeze” as soon as they begin their trip to ensure that their scooters are working properly. The warning comes several months after The Washington Post reported that Lime scooters had a history of breaking apart in use, injuring riders nationwide. The company also pulled thousands of scooters out of circulation in California over the summer after discovering that a small number of them may have been carrying batteries with the potential to catch fire. More recently, reports of riders being injured by malfunctioning brakes have emerged in Switzerland, New Zealand and the United States. Lime said the company’s braking issue demonstrates that risk is an ever-present feature of its devices. “While this issue has affected less than 0.0045% of all Lime rides, some riders have been injured, and, although most have been bumps and bruises, any injury is one too many,” the statement said, without specifying where the incidents occurred. “Like all forms of transportation, there is risk that we work to mitigate but cannot entirely eliminate.” But reports from New Zealand — where two cities temporarily banned the devices last week — suggest that the number of riders injured by locking brakes in recent weeks is significant. Lime informed Auckland city officials that the company had identified 155 incidents involving irregular braking, of which 30 resulted in injury, according to the New Zealand Herald. The paper published bloody images of one rider who allegedly broke his jaw on both sides this month when a Lime scooter he was riding stopped without warning, tossing him overboard. “I was in the middle of the path and it was clear — there were no bumps or anything,” Liam Thompson, 27, told the Herald. “The wheels just stopped and locked in place, and I got thrown off the front of the scooter,” he added. The company was forced to pull hundreds of scooters from two Swiss cities after riders were injured by locking brakes, according to the Local. This month, a Texas man told the Austin American Statesman that he landed in the street when the wheels of the Lime scooter he was riding suddenly locked in place. Jeremiah Mahoney, 38, told the paper that he has filed a lawsuit against Lime that accuses the company of negligence. Mahoney is seeking $10,000 in damages, the Statesman reported. “That thing could have malfunctioned under any circumstance at any location, and who knows what could have happened?” Mahoney told the paper. “It’s really a roll of the dice, in my opinion.” In an apologetic opinion column published by the Herald on Monday, Mitchell Price, Lime’s director of government affairs and strategy, described a mechanical problem that was not only dangerous, but difficult to resolve. “Our teams have been working around the clock to rigorously assess our fleet while working to pinpoint the cause of this issue and rectify it swiftly,” he wrote. “We hired a world-renowned, multi-disciplinary engineering and scientific consulting firm to act as an independent expert to determine the cause of the problem,” he added. Price also noted that Lime is working with consumer protection agencies around the world to ensure that its devices meet “rigorous safety expectations.” At least one of those investigations involved the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, which began working with Lime in November after The Post reported that the company’s scooters had been breaking apart for months while people were riding them. The company had continued to rent out structurally unsound scooters despite receiving warnings from company mechanics and other workers, Lime employees told The Post. Before Lime publicly acknowledged the potential fire hazard involving its batteries, some employees raised concerns internally about whether the company was doing enough to address safety risks with its scooters, according to a Lime mechanic speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution for commenting publicly. The mechanic provided images of internal Slack messages in which another employee also raises concerns. “I feel that these scoots, or the product as a whole, should be removed from the market until they are safe to handle and operate,” one employee wrote in the “mechanics” Slack room. “I get that the scoots are expendable and replaceable, but are we now resigned to say the same for the safety of employees and customers?” This month, a 21-year-old exchange student from Ireland was killed in an accident involving a Lime scooter. Police say Mark Sands was riding a Lime scooter and traveling in the wrong direction on a busy downtown street in Austin when he was struck by an Uber driver, leaving him badly injured. He was taken to a hospital but died the next day, authorities said. Though no official tally is known, an unofficial count suggests that Sands is at least the third person to die in an accident involving the electric mobility devices, which have swept across the nation in the past year. Jacoby Stoneking — a 24-year-old Dallas man — died after falling off a Lime electric scooter in September and receiving blunt-force head injuries, authorities said. Carlos Sanchez-Martin of Silver Spring, Md., was fatally struck by an SUV in September while riding a Lime scooter in Washington. One evening in late December, Thomas –– a congressional staff member who asked to have his last name withheld due to the sensitive nature of his work –– hopped on a Lime scooter to make his way home. As his scooter reached about 12 miles per hour three blocks later, he said, the device’s brakes seized up without warning. Thomas was thrown onto the street and used his wrist to break his fall. “It felt like an ejection seat,” he said. Fortunately, he recalled, there were no cars or people nearby, but the impact did break his elbow. ""When I came into work my boss, who is a member of Congress, asked what happened,” he said. “When I explained how the injury happened, she said, ‘There needs to be a law regulating these devices,’ and I told her I agreed.” “Imagine if your car just suddenly locked its brakes on the highway,” he added. “That would never be allowed to happen.” Nearly two months later, Thomas said, his body has mostly healed, but his outrage at Lime continues to fester. “I was such an evangelist, telling everyone that scooters are great,” he said. “Every time I see one now, I want to kick it.""",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/25/lime-scooter-riders-are-being-injured-by-sudden-excessive-braking-company-admits/
"Shared scooters barely last a month, report says. But that could change.",Mashable,,National,2019,2,28,"Shared scooters barely last a month, report says. But that could change. It's tough out there for an e-scooter. The battery-powered vehicles used by most scooter-sharing companies weren't intended for such heavy use. The first generation of shared scooters were mainly from Xioami, and not made with the type of usage scooter rental companies like Bird put the vehicle through. Alison Griswold in her Overshare newsletter about the sharing economy crunched the numbers this week from Louisville, Kentucky's scooter-share program. It's based mostly on Bird rides and found between August and December the average lifespan of a scooter there was 28 days. As the scooter companies grow and stick around, they've learned quickly that the vehicles need to be more durable. A month turnover does not make for a lasting business model as Griswold goes into. Nor does it sound very green, especially for companies like Bird that tout the millions of pounds of carbon emissions its scooters eliminate. Most of the e-scooter companies I reached out to didn't want to release specific numbers about scooter lifespans or cycles. Bird wouldn't comment directly on the 28-days finding. But the companies did emphasize their new models are designed with heavy usage in mind. Lime last year introduced its Gen. 3 scooter with a wider base and wheels and the company expects it to last longer than previous scooter models as it comes into more markets this year. At the end of last year Lime was struggling with combusting scooters, and more recently a braking bug. Segway-Ninebot's Model Max was introduced at CES in January as the new fleet scooter for companies like Bird and Lyft. A fact sheet about the new model plainly states, ""From their learnings being at the center of the growing scooter-sharing market, Segway-Ninebot found that there tends to be a lot of wear and tear on shared scooters, which results in costly product maintenance, as well as short product life span."" Without any specific numbers, the newer product claims to ""last longer"" with a more robust design. Goat, the Austin-based scooter company that lets you operate your own scooter business, put out this week that it would be offering the new Segway scooters. It has a current offer for would-be scooter empires to buy the scooters for $599. Meanwhile, electric bicycles part of a shared fleet like Uber-owned Jump are ""designed to last years,"" a company spokesperson said in an email. Yes, parts will need to be replaced like tires, but the bike itself can roll on much longer. Same with the Lyft-owned Motivate bike-sharing company that runs Ford GoBike in the Bay Area or Citi Bike in New York City. A spokesperson also said the e-bikes are designed to last for years. Superpedestrian released what it calls a ""smart"" scooter last year, built for the hard-riding street life of a rental scooter. It's supposed to last in a shared fleet for nine to 18 months. CEO Assaf Biderman said in an email standard fleet technology used by other operators to monitor, track, and repair scooters means ""much shorter vehicle lifespan"" compared to the more involved system used for his scooters. He cited industry reports with as quick as 11 days of use in Austin, Texas, before a new vehicle is brought in. Another built-to-last scooter for fleets comes from Acton (its fleet vehicle is billed as a an ""urban warrior""). Company co-founder Peter Treadway said in a Mashable interview last year, ""It’s built like a vehicle, not a toy, to withstand the everyday wear and tear of commercial use."" It's time for e-scooters to toughen up. UPDATE: March 6, 2019, 4:09 p.m. PST Scooter rental company Scoot, with e-scooters in San Francisco and Santiago, credited its new locking system for longer lifespans.

Disability Rights Group Sues San Diego Over Scooters On Sidewalks,NPR,NPR,National,2019,3,4,"Disability Rights Group Sues San Diego Over Scooters On Sidewalks. Electric scooters have taken cities across the country by surprise, sometimes causing conflicts with city authorities and pedestrians. In San Diego, the scooters have led to a federal lawsuit claiming the new devices cause discrimination against people with disabilities. The lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court in January and seeks to be a class action, claims the city and scooter rental companies Lime, Bird and Razor have failed to prevent people from riding or parking scooters on sidewalks. Scooters have blocked people with disabilities from accessing the public right-of-way, the plaintiffs claim, and have turned sidewalks into a ""vehicle highway"" where pedestrians are at risk of injury. ""People with disabilities who wish to travel in the City using the City's walkways are being forced to either put their physical safety at risk or just stay home,"" the complaint reads. ""This is not a choice that they should have to make."" The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting scooters from being parked or operated on sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps and other walkways. Scooters started showing up in San Diego and cities across the country roughly a year ago. They are part of what industry insiders call ""micromobility"" — the use of small, wheeled devices, usually linked to smartphone technology, to travel relatively short distances. Complaints about scooters came swiftly, and some cities have banned private rental companies from placing scooters on their streets and sidewalks. San Diego has taken a far more cautious approach to scooter regulations, with some city leaders warning that reacting too hastily could cause the city to miss out on their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most of which come from cars and trucks. A set of regulations proposed by Mayor Kevin Faulconer would, among other things, require scooter rental companies to automatically reduce speeds in certain high-pedestrian zones. Need for hyper-vigilance since scooters arrived Alex Montoya, one of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, was born missing his right leg and both his arms. He uses prosthetic limbs and says he chose to live in the East Village neighborhood of downtown San Diego because it was easier for him to get around without a car. Montoya says since the arrival of scooters, he has had to remain hyper-vigilant to avoid getting knocked down by scooter riders, most of whom he observes riding on the sidewalk. ""It's really such a scary endeavor,"" he says. ""Because of my prosthetic leg, I can't get out of the way as quickly."" Riding motorized scooters on sidewalks is illegal under California law, as is parking them — or any other object — in such a way that blocks pedestrian or disabled access to public walkways. Montoya says he has not seen those laws adequately enforced downtown. San Diego Police Department data show there were 551 citations issued to people for riding a scooter on the sidewalk in 2018. Police issued more than four times as many citations to people riding without a helmet — something that, as of Jan. 1, is no longer illegal for people 18 and older. Micromobility and the environment Sophie Wolfram, director of programs at the nonprofit Climate Action Campaign, says it's unacceptable that people with disabilities fear for their safety because of scooters. She says people's tendency to ride on sidewalks shows how unsafe they feel sharing a lane with cars. Plans for protected bike lanes downtown and throughout the region have faced numerous delays. ""It's not fair to ask people to risk their necks every time they want to make a trip on a scooter by riding in traffic,"" Wolfram says. ""So there's a lot that the city can do and needs to do to build protected space that makes it safe for scooters. And when the city does that...it also makes it safer for pedestrians to reclaim the sidewalk for slower uses."" Wolfram added that much of the criticism of scooters — that they are nuisances, eyesores or safety hazards — can easily be applied to cars, as well. Car crashes kill more than 100 people per day, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Wolfram says scooters disrupt transportation in ways that have ""exposed some biases we have about how we should move around our city, and what kinds of mobility devices we accept having strewn about our city."" The San Diego City Attorney's Office says it would respond to the complaint through the courts. Prioritizing safety Katie Stevens, Lime's senior director of government relations for the west, says the company has invested $3 million in a safety education campaign, frequently gives away free helmets and employs a team of on-the-ground responders to move illegally parked scooters. ""We are also convening an industry-wide education and safety summit on micromobility,"" she says. The summit will include disability rights leaders, she says, and will focus on ""making sure that these micromobility models thrive in a very safe environment."" Attempts to reach Bird and Razor for interviews were unsuccessful. Lawsuit plaintiff Alex Montoya says he was encouraged by the mayor's willingness to regulated scooters, and that he understands their appeal as an alternative to cars. ""I think the scooters are a great invention,"" Montoya says. ""But I think if they are here to stay, they need to be really regulated in a way that's safe for everyone.""",https://www.npr.org/2019/03/04/698768297/disability-rights-group-sues-san-diego-over-scooters-on-sidewalks
Injuries prompt CDC investigation into e-scooters,CNN,,National,2019,3,4,"Injuries prompt CDC investigation into e-scooters. University of Texas star baseball shortstop David Hamilton hit a pothole riding an electric scooter, tearing his Achilles tendon and requiring surgery. He'll miss the season. Cristal Glangchai, the CEO for a nonprofit, hit a rock riding her scooter, landing her on the pavement just blocks from home. ""I lost control and ended up getting a concussion and a broken rib,"" said Glangchai, a 41-year-old mother of four. And Austin's first scooter-related death occurred in January. Police identified the scooter rider as Mark Sands, a 21-year-old UT student from Ireland, who died just one day after suffering critical injuries when the electric scooter he was riding collided with a car. As many as 14,000 dockless electric scooters are on the streets of Austin, whose 326 square miles are home to almost 1 million people. That likely makes Austin one of the cities with the highest scooter-to-citizen ratio in the nation -- though the electric vehicles are also rapidly multiplying on the streets and sidewalks of Atlanta, San Diego, Nashville and Washington. At least 1,200 more are poised to appear in Austin whenever already-licensed operators deploy them. Ten companies have licenses to operate now. Austin city leaders, worried about injuries for both users and pedestrians, asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate scooter-related crashes and injuries. The first-ever CDC scooter study will also look at how accidents could be prevented. ""We're totally paranoid,"" said Forrest Preece, a retired advertising executive who lives in a downtown condo and leads a largely pedestrian life. ""I'm 72 and my wife is 70. It would be easy to knock us over,"" he said. ""My wife actually went online and found a little mirror to attach to her wrist to look behind her so she's not constantly turning around. We go single file so she can see that mirror and see what's behind us."" These scooters are everywhere -- speeding by or strewn on sidewalks -- and are likely to overwhelm the city this spring as Austin readies for an onslaught of scooter-riding visitors during the annual SXSW Conference & Festivals, running March 8-17. Last year's SXSW drew 432,500 people. The scooter study was launched in December when three CDC epidemiologists spent two weeks in Austin reviewing incidents and scooter-related injuries during a 60-day period from September to November. They began contacting the 258 individuals identified through EMS calls or who visited emergency rooms with a scooter-related injury. Findings from this study will likely be released in March and could have far-reaching effects as cities across the country grapple with reports of injuries from these e-scooters. ""We don't know if there's something unique about Austin or the population there that may be different from other parts of the United States or globally,"" said Eric Pevzner, chief of the Atlanta-based CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service, which is conducting the probe. ""The rate of scooter injuries in Austin may be consistent with what's being noticed in other places, or it may be much higher."" These zippy, colorful motorized scooters, which are rented with a smartphone app and dropped off almost anywhere, are hard to resist. The companies behind them -- Bird, Bolt, Lime, Scoot, Skip and Spin, among others -- promote them as smart, low-cost transportation alternatives for short distances, especially in cities. Neither Bird nor Lime responded to multiple interview requests. Data on scooter-related injuries are collected by the Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), but the category also includes skateboards and hoverboards, which account for the bulk of the injuries in the most recent data from 2017 -- well before scooters proliferated across the country. The Austin study will help develop a baseline for comparison. So far, what's believed to be the first published study examining scooter injuries was released in January in JAMA Network Open, a peer-reviewed medical journal. UCLA researchers studied 249 patients (228 scooter riders and 21 pedestrians) treated at two emergency departments over a year's time. Head injuries and fractures were the most common diagnosis. Among scooter riders, 80 percent were injured in a fall, 11 percent collided with an object, and almost 9 percent were hit by a moving vehicle or object. For almost 5 percent of patients, intoxication was a factor. Just 4 percent of riders wore a helmet. Such findings don't surprise physicians. ""We're seeing five to six minor injuries a week, almost one a day -- hand and arm fractures, broken bones and facial injuries, such as scrapes and bumps and fractures,"" said Dr. Oscar Guillamondegui, trauma ICU medical director at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. ""Approximately one to two major traumatic brain injuries a month are admitted to the trauma center. The reason is simple. Who's carrying a helmet? No one. No one is wearing them because no one is carrying them."" Guillamondegui appeared last month on a panel dubbed a ""community conversation about scooters in Nashville"" as that city mulls more regulation. In Atlanta, the number of injuries per month has increased from about 30 to about 100, said Dr. Hany Atallah, chief of emergency medicine at Grady Health System, which includes Grady Memorial Hospital, the largest hospital in Georgia. Grady, which is among the nation's busiest Level 1 trauma centers, is looking at the rise and scope of scooter injuries as a new internal project. ""I'm concerned people are riding these things without helmets and on roads in busier traffic,"" he said ""As opposed to motorcycles, these wheels are pretty small. Certainly, hitting a pothole can send someone over."" Cities are trying to balance the electric scooter as a boost to mobility with ensuring the safety of riders who travel amid motorists and pedestrians. There are plenty of reports of pedestrians tripping or falling over parked scooters, as well as tales of being hit by moving scooters. A handful of scooter-related deaths occurred last year: one each in Dallas, Washington, D.C., Chula Vista, Calif., and Cleveland. Some cities have introduced regulations that include banning the scooters, regulating the numbers allowed on the streets and specifying where they can park or ride. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the City Commission plans to evaluate its dockless mobility permit program and consider adjustments that could enhance safety, spokeswoman Dayana Diaz said. Officials in Portland, Ore., decided in January to conduct a second scooter pilot program this spring studying the impact of e-scooters on the city. This one will last a year, following a July through November study that found 176 people went to emergency rooms with scooter injuries. Of those, 84 percent fell from a scooter and 90 percent of riders didn't wear a helmet. As electric scooters multiply around the country and the world, a survey of 7,000 people in 11 major U.S. cities by the San Francisco-based data platform Populus found that 70 percent of those surveyed had a positive view of scooters. Atlanta placed first, with 79 percent of its residents in the positive category. Austin was a close second, at 76 percent. The CDC Austin study will calculate injuries per number of scooters ridden and per mile traveled. As researchers speak with those hurt, they'll ask about road conditions, street types, weather, helmet use and behaviors, including alcohol use while riding. While the study continues, Austin's transportation department announced a ""pause"" in issuing new licenses to dockless mobility operators to assess the level of demand for those currently licensed and to ensure safety. The city is also reviewing its current rules and expects to revise the scooter rider ordinance this spring. And, with the start of a new semester at UT-Austin, university officials announced new rules and fines for scooter use and indicated more changes are ahead, including dropping scooter speed limits on campus from 15 mph to 8 mph. Glangchai, the injured CEO, said she'll now ""always wear a helmet and be a little more cautious"" when she resumes riding following a six-week doctor-ordered hiatus. ""Scooters empower people. It seems so easy to hop on and press go,"" she said. ""It seems like it's easier to take more risks on a scooter. They're great because you get around places quickly, but it's almost like it's too easy for people to hop on and go fast.""",https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/04/health/scooter-injury-cdc-investigation-partner/index.html
Editorial: All those scooters everywhere? That’s a good thing,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,3,7,"Editorial: All those scooters everywhere? That’s a good thing. It may seem as if rent-per-ride electric scooters are already ubiquitous in Los Angeles, either in use or parked on the sidewalk. But the scooter population in the city is about to boom. Starting this month, 11 companies will be permitted to put 37,000 dockless scooters and bikes on city streets. Most of the companies have sought permits for shared electric scooters rather than bikes. If companies take advantage of the city’s new rules, which allow for even more shared bikes and scooters if they are placed in certain disadvantaged communities, Los Angeles could soon have more than 100,000 of the vehicles on the streets. Some people may see this as a nuisance or a safety threat, but the coming ubiquity of scooters should actually be an exciting moment for Los Angeles. The city is about to engage in an experiment to see if regulations can curtail the negatives of scooters (tipped over vehicles, blocked sidewalks, careless riders) and allow the positives (environmentally friendly, fun, car-free travel) to flourish. Scooters could become an important piece of the urban transportation system. They are a convenient, affordable option for people who want to travel a short distance, including those who need to traverse the “first-mile, last-mile” distance between their homes and jobs and transit stations. More broadly, the popularity of scooters could help increase the number of people advocating for protected lanes and smarter road design — thereby increasing safety and giving people more transportation choices than driving, which in turn would help reduce the tailpipe emissions that foul the air and warm the planet. But all those potential benefits are contingent on getting the scooter situation right. They have to be safe, responsible and convenient. To their credit, Los Angeles leaders have been working hard on the responsible part. Beginning this month, Angelenos can report broken or improperly parked vehicles on the city’s MyLA311 service request form or app, and the companies are required to resolve the problem within two hours. If a company fails to respond, the city could impound the scooter and ultimately revoke the company’s permit. For scooters to be more than a novelty, scooter companies need to be held to a high standard. The biggest challenge is making scooters safe — both for riders and the people around them. Motorized scooters are a relatively new mode of transportation, and there are lots of inexperienced riders, who may underestimate the risk and overestimate their ability to ride safely. There were quite a few more scooter-related injuries (249) than bike (195) or pedestrian (181) injuries seen at local emergency rooms on the Westside, according to UCLA researchers, who conducted the first limited analysis of scooter injuries. They also found that riders rarely wore helmets and that a significant number of injured riders were younger than 18 — which is the minimum age for renting an electric scooter. Scooter companies and local governments need to develop more aggressive safety policies. Police must ticket riders who operate in a dangerous manner. Companies could find ways to automatically throttle down scooter speeds in certain high-risk areas. Companies say they are developing technology that could automatically shut scooters off if people try to ride on the sidewalk. And — most important — cities need to build the infrastructure, such as protected bike lanes, that enable and encourage scooter riders to cruise safely. There’s a learning curve with scooters and other “micromobility” services, and experience should shape the policies and regulations to make them safer and better for everyone. That’s why a recent proposal by Councilman Gil Cedillo is so frustrating. He wants to ban scooters for at least a year in his district, which includes Chinatown, Echo Park, Highland Park and Westlake. Those are some of the most transit-friendly areas of the city, and they could benefit from having scooters as a first-mile, last-mile connection. They are also communities that the city has specifically targeted to ensure that scooter companies don’t just serve wealthy enclaves, but also poorer neighborhoods that could be helped by more low-cost mobility options. Los Angeles is a city that needs more transportation choices and innovation if it is serious about getting people out of their polluting, traffic-clogging cars.",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-scooters-los-angeles-ban-20190307-story.html
Bird Exports Its Scooter Business By Licensing To Local Entrepreneurs,Forbes,,National,2019,3,7,"In the scooter gold rush, Bird doesn’t want to just be the one that strikes gold—it also wants to be the one to sell the picks and shovels to other entrepreneurs looking to strike it rich, too.To do so, Bird is expanding its Bird Platform program, which licenses its business model to local operators who want to start a scooter business in exchange for Bird getting a 20% cut of the revenues. Entrepreneurs can buy the scooters at cost from Bird and get access to its playbook on how to launch and scale a business. In some cases, the locally owned scooters will be available through Bird’s app.On Thursday, the $2 billion company is announcing that it has expanded the Bird Platform to Canada, New Zealand and Latin America.“We’re not going to stop operating or stop launching. We’re going to continue to launch, but our focus just continues to be on the U.S. and Europe right now,” founder and CEO Travis VanderZanden told Forbes. “We think our platform is incredibly complementary because it allows us to get into other regions around the world faster and take the Bird mission to those other regions.” It’s the next step in Bird’s vision to bring scooter-sharing to the world, but it’s a safer route that limits risks and future profits. VanderZanden says the 16-month-old company simply can’t expand into every geographic area at once, so it’s come up with a different strategy to enter foreign markets: partner with local operators and take a share of their success.It’s a move that lowers risks on what could be a costly international expansion for the scooter-sharing company. VanderZanden worked at Uber, where he saw the ride-hailing giant wage several costly wars in markets like China and countries in Southeast Asia. Uber has since retreated in both markets, selling its business to local incumbents.Bird’s strategy means scooter businesses in local markets get operated by entrepreneurs who know the city and its regulations. In some areas, riders will still use the Bird app to access the scooters. Other businesses will run their own app or renting schemes, VanderZanden said. To get started, operators have to buy the scooters from Bird, but by doing so they get to take advantage of the lower prices Bird pays per scooter because of the scale of its business.The platform scheme may be a safer play than rushing into every market, but it will also deliver smaller future profits than if Bird controlled its own destiny in each. VanderZanden said it’s too early to predict how much of the 20% revenue share will contribute to future revenues. (Bird remains unprofitable and is expected to book over $100 million in revenue this year.)It’s also a defensive move to block its rivals, like U.S.-based Lime, from gaining monopolies in foreign markets. Lime has expanded to countries like New Zealand and Chile already and has gained a lock on the scooter market in those countries so far.“We could launch New Zealand ourselves, or we could launch it through the platform, but we’re going to launch it one way or the other. We just happen to think that in New Zealand, because we have a great local operator, that it made more sense to use the platform,” VanderZanden said. “The citizens of Auckland should have choice on their scooters: safe ones.” (Auckland suspended Lime scooters following a software bug that injured 30 people, but they returned to the streets on Thursday).While Bird operates its own scooter business in the Europe and U.S., it hasn't ruled out expanding into more areas in the future. Other regions, like Asia, Australia and Africa, are still anyone’s game.VanderZanden says 2019 is focused on “scaling responsibly.” In the past year his company raised over $415 million, jumped to a $2 billion valuation and launched in over 100 cities. Meanwhile its scooters were falling apart and being stolen at a fast clip (the average scooter lasted over a month, but not much longer than that). Instead, Bird has spent much of the winter in its own hibernation working to fix its scooters, build out centers for repairs, and revamp its charging program to cut down on theft and fraud. All of that is meant to reset the company so it can prove that scooters aren’t just another money-losing business, like ride-hailing. While revenues took a dip in the winter thanks to snow on the streets, the company was still doing enough business to hit a $100 million run rate during some winter weeks, according to VanderZanden.“I think it’s largely overblown at how seasonal the business gets,” he said. “It’s like saying Amazon is seasonal. But even Amazon’s lowest month is still a pretty big business.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/03/07/bird-goes-global-with-franchises-letting-local-entrepreneurs-run-their-own-scooter-business/
Scooter start-up Bird ditches its gig economy mechanics,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,3,8,"Scooter start-up Bird ditches its gig economy mechanics. The scooter rental company Bird Rides Inc. has quietly begun abandoning its practice of paying independent contractors a per-vehicle rate to fix its scooters in several cities. In late February, mechanics working in San Diego received an email saying their services would no longer be needed, and that they should repair any vehicles in their possession and return them to the company immediately. This week, mechanics in Phoenix and the Los Angeles area said the feature in Bird’s app they used to find work had been unceremoniously disabled. “In order to better serve the community, we are expanding our in-house repair facilities,” the company explained in its email to mechanics in San Diego. Over the last several years, many start-ups have pursued a controversial alternative to using employees to provide the services they’re selling: They establish short-term, smartphone-based labor marketplaces where workers compete to, say, drive someone across town or deliver a burrito. Scooter companies have become one of the big new venues for such work, sometimes called the gig economy. As they spread electric scooters out across dozens of cities, companies like Bird and Lime began paying people a piecemeal rate to recharge them and, in Bird’s case, repair them. The company’s recent move illustrates the difficulties of such a decentralized operation, and the suddenness of the pivot also drives home the uncertain economic prospects for people relying on gig economy platforms for income. Bird confirmed that it’s abandoning the practice of dispatching independent mechanics through a smartphone app. “We have found the independent contractor side doesn’t work as much there,” said Travis VanderZanden, the company’s CEO. “What we’ve decided to do is move it all to service centers.” The company didn’t say it would hire its own employees at these service centers; it uses staffing agencies for some hourly repair work already. Bird will continue to pay people a per-vehicle rate to charge scooters. The new model will give Bird tighter control over its repair operations. It exerted very little influence over its gig economy mechanics. After applying online, doing a phone interview, watching training videos online, and getting a small set of tools in the mail, they’d get access to a feature on Bird’s app to find broken scooters. They’d fix those that could be repaired and take the rest to Bird facilities, where Bird hired hourly employees to make more significant repairs. As with other gig economy jobs, pay varied according to the number of scooters needing repair and the number of mechanics available to fix them. Mechanics said they’d average $15 per repaired scooter, and could bring in as much as $400 on a good day. Four mechanics who went through the vetting process said it left them feeling uneasy. “It wasn’t like a regular job. It was like, ‘You have the skills? We’ll take your word for it.’ It was kind of sketchy,” said Ozzy Lagunas, a 25-year-old San Diego resident who used his earnings to supplement the wages he made helping prepare health exams for people applying for life insurance. On a busy day, he said, he’d make $300. Lagunas felt like he was on his own. He said that Bird didn’t supply sufficient spare parts, so he’d harvest badly damaged scooters to get more lightly worn vehicles back on the road quickly. The next rider would often hop on before anyone else had checked his work. Once, Lagunas said, he fell while testing a scooter he was repairing. He hit his head and scraped his knee, and considered going to the hospital. Lagunas called the company to see what help it could provide, but it didn’t offer any. He said he decided to make do without medical care. Bird didn’t respond to questions about Lagunas’ account. The scooter craze has inspired questions about safety. Many people have suffered serious injuries riding scooters, and several lawsuits charge that the negligence of Bird and its competitors is to blame. “These companies are putting profit over safety,” Catherine Lerer, a lawyer representing one group of plaintiffs, said in October. At the time, Bird issued a written statement saying class-action attorneys would do better to focus on safety issues related to automobiles. Lagunas said he saw Bird’s decision to bring repairs in-house as a prudent safety move. There’s evidence that not all of the company’s maintenance issues can be attributed to the gig model, though. A lawsuit filed in January by a mechanic who worked an hourly job through a contracting agency alleges that Bird instructed workers to ignore safety problems. Court filings show internal messages telling workers that scooters with loose handlebars and missing screws shouldn’t be considered damaged. The case is pending. Bird has yet to respond. There is also increasing uncertainty about whether the gig economy is legal. Last spring, the California Supreme Court made it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors. Since then, at least four people who worked for Bird as chargers or mechanics have filed separate lawsuits alleging the company has misclassified them as contractors. They claim the company has used this practice to avoid paying minimum wage and granting its workers other benefits of full-time employment. In court filings, Bird has denied charges that it misclassified workers. “While we are not able to comment on the specifics of former contractors or ongoing litigation, we can share that as a transportation company the safety of our riders, chargers, mechanics and all others who interact with our vehicles is our utmost concern,” a Bird spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. The way Bird handled the change left some mechanics feeling blindsided. San Diego-based mechanic Alex Frost said that by last October, he was making enough money to quit his job in sales at an auto body detailing shop. He made at least $130 most days, and on busy days would work more than 10 hours and make as much as $400. Frost said Bird gave him no notice and didn’t offer him a chance at a conventional job. “I’ve invested my time into the business, to learn what they want and to do what they need to have done,” he said. “So why wouldn’t they just retain us as employees?” Another mechanic who works in Riverside said his experience with Bird had followed a pattern he recognized from other gig economy jobs. They’re all lucrative and flexible at first, but the earnings erode over time as competition increases and the platforms look to squeeze out better margins. The man, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Mike, said the same thing had happened when he ferried riders around for Uber and delivered marijuana for a company called Eaze. Mike described the routine he developed over five months working for Bird. Each evening after putting his kids to bed, he would drive around town, picking up damaged scooters and piling them up in his garage. He’d wake up and take the children to school in the morning when his wife went to work, then spend a few hours fixing flat tires and broken brakes. As time went on, it became harder to find enough scooters to justify the time. Also, an increasing proportion of the vehicles he did find were too damaged to repair; he’d drive those to a storage facility about 20 minutes from his home. This made financial sense so long as he could get a full load. On Monday, Mike dropped off a batch of scooters at the storage facility. When he opened the Bird app to find some more, the section for mechanics had just disappeared. He wasn’t surprised. “It always sucks to lose money, no matter who you are, no matter how much you make,” he said. But he also knew he couldn’t count on any form of income security. “Doing the gig economy,” he said, “you learn that.”",https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bird-scooter-mechanics-20190308-story.html
Scooters are littering sidewalks and injuring pedestrians. Can this start-up bring order to the chaos?,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,3,12,"Scooters are littering sidewalks and injuring pedestrians. Can this start-up bring order to the chaos? They lean against bike racks, block entrances, crowd street corners and tip onto their sides, turning a convenient form of transportation into a sidewalk hazard that is particularly dangerous for the elderly and disabled. Now a California startup is pitching cities on a possible solution for reigning in the chaos unleashed by electric scooters in cities around the country. That company, known as Swiftmile, has unveiled unattended charging stations for e-scooters that are designed to serve as a place where riders can dock the devices between rides. The company’s founder, Colin Roche, 47, said the solar-powered charging stations — which can accommodate any brand of e-scooter — are ideal for the kind of pedestrian-congested areas where the devices are often discarded, such as bus and subway stations. Though he declined to name specific cities, Roche said his company is already in talks with three major metropolitan markets with large fleets of scooters on their streets. “We bring order to the chaos,” Roche said. “We are the peacemaker between cities and scooter operators.” As the weather warms and ridership increases, that struggle is expected to intensify. On one side of the debate, experts say, are cities whose leaders want to reduce traffic and encourage alternative, environmentally-friendly modes of transportation to combat climate change and promote innovation. Some local officials also fear that cracking down on scooter companies will cast cities in an outdated light, discouraging technology companies from doing business there in the future. On the other side of the debate are critics who have railed against e-scooter companies for blocking walkways and selling a product whose use has led to thousands of injuries among riders and pedestrians, many of them severe. For the harshest critics, the idea that local officials would kowtow to faraway companies after those companies dumped their products on their streets without permission is indefensible. Pat Burt, a former Palo Alto mayor who is currently advising Swiftmile, said the future of e-scooters could depend heavily on what happens in 2019. Cities have identified the benefits of e-scooters as well as the drawbacks, which could become existential for the companies. “If the safety and other problems aren’t addressed, I think cities will restrict them even more,” he said. “But there’s a good chance scooters will be adopted universally if these problems get solved. But cities have to solve these problems or this business model isn’t going to be as strong as we thought it was.” “Cities are already seeing a backlash,” he added. “There’s scooter litter everywhere right now.” Roche maintains the docking stations will save e-scooter companies money because they won’t have to pay gig economy workers to take scooters home at night and charge them. The process of picking e-scooters up off the street, throwing them into the back of a truck and transporting them somewhere to be charged damages the devices and makes them more dangerous for riders, he said. The average lifespan of a scooter is 45 days, Roche said, though it can be as low as 18 days in some locations due to harsher weather. Though estimates vary, the Information reported last year that Bird scooters cost the company between $500 and $600 per vehicle, though that number could’ve dropped as the design improved. “Scooter companies spend 50 percent of their operating costs on charging these things,” Roche said. “If they make about $15 on average a day on a scooter, they’re spending about $7 or $8 a day to have someone pick it up and charge it.” “Once a scooter goes dead, it’s not making money,” he added. Without a system for managing scooters, doctors and city officials said they expect pedestrian injuries to continue. Dr. Jim Sallis — a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Public Health and the University of California San Diego — said pedestrians may not realize they’ve been losing territory to technology for more than 100 years. The losses began in the 1920s, he said, when the automobile industry coined the term “jaywalker” to criminalize foot traffic on public streets, which until then had been dominated by pedestrians. Fast forward nearly a century, Sallis said, and what remains of pedestrians territory is under assault. “The sidewalks are no longer a sanctuary for a pedestrians where you don’t have to worry about getting run over,” Sallis said. “If sidewalks are not a sanctuary for pedestrians, what is?” For pedestrians injured by misplaced scooters, recovery can be painstakingly slow. After dropping her elderly mother off in front of a Santa Monica college, Paula Green said she found her 87-year-old mother lying in the street dazed and bleeding, unable to stand up and move. Dolly Green had tripped over a Lyft scooter crowding the sidewalk and fallen off a curb, sustaining five pelvic fractures, a deep elbow wound and a swollen knee, her daughter said. Months later, Green has moved in with her daughter, but has yet to regain her mobility or her active schedule of painting classes and tennis. Stuck inside her daughter’s home on pain medication, Green’s battle is as much emotional as it is physical, her daughter, Paula Green, said. A photo — snapped as her mother lay helpless in the street — is still hard to look at, Paula Green said, noting her mother may sue Lyft. “This has totally destroyed her,"" Green added, referring to her mother. “She’s very upset and rattled. She rarely leaves the house and look what happened when she did.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/12/scooters-are-littering-sidewalks-injuring-pedestrians-can-this-startup-bring-order-chaos/
Who Charges All Those Electric Scooters? Follow A Nocturnal 'Juicer',NPR,NPR,National,2019,3,13,"Who Charges All Those Electric Scooters? Follow A Nocturnal 'Juicer'. Some people love electric scooters. Some people hate them. And some people charge them — for money. By day, Joel Kirzner is a consultant in Arlington, Va. But when he wraps up work in the office, he pulls out his phone and checks multiple scooter apps to see what's available nearby. If there are scooters low on battery, they'll show up in the map on his phone. And if he can find the scooter in real life (and beat any rival chargers to the punch), he'll earn a few bucks for each one he charges at home. ""It's like Pokémon Go and you make money,"" he says. On a recent evening, he sees two scooters up for grabs just around the corner from his office. He hops in his Subaru Impreza and starts collecting. Electric scooters are hot right now. Lime and Bird, the two biggest companies, are valued at some $2 billion each. You can rent scooters by the minute from one or both companies in more than 100 cities across the country — from Abilene, Texas, to Tacoma, Wash. And both companies rely on independent contractors such as Kirzner to keep the wheels rolling, by taking the scooters to their homes and charging them in ordinary outlets. In the process, chargers fulfill another key need: They help move scooters from out-of-the-way locations to hot spots where they'll find more riders. Lime calls the chargers ""juicers."" Bird has its own puns: The chargers ""capture"" Birds, and then release them to ""nests"" — specific locations chosen by the company — in the morning. This is largely nocturnal work: Some scooters don't become available for charging until after 9 p.m., and they're supposed to be back on the roads early the next morning so they're available for commuters. Starting after sunset on a recent chilly night, Kirzner collects 12 scooters in quick succession near his office building before heading home to charge them. He's collecting Birds tonight — there were more available than Limes — and earning $4 or $5 for each, including a bonus for collecting multiple scooters. The bounty offered per scooter varies based on location, level of charge and how long a scooter has been standing idle (a sign it might be in a less-desirable location). And in general, the bounties have gone down over time. For instance, Bird used to pay up to $20 for scooters that had been waiting the longest. But unscrupulous chargers would take scooters off the street and hoard them while their value increased; now, Kirzner says, $20 for a charge is all but unheard of. The declining rates have reduced some of the previously fierce competition to snag scooters. Many people just aren't willing to hit the road for smaller payouts — especially on a cold, windy March night. Andy Castillo, who used to collect Lime scooters in Washington, D.C., isn't charging anymore. He used to go out with his mom, who's retired — ""it was a way for us to spend time together,"" he says — and they'd fill up his pickup with scooters. ""When I first started, it was $6 a scooter,"" Castillo says. ""They lowered the price recently to $4, and I did it once or twice after that and it wasn't as exciting."" Kirzner says it's still worth it for him to charge, especially since he rarely goes out of his way, collecting and redistributing right near his office and his home. ""It's like picking money off the street,"" he says, when he finishes one pickup and spots another scooter, worth $5 per charge, available just across the street. Of course, it's not that easy. Once they're all stacked in his hatchback — he has a very precise system for squeezing in up to a dozen Birds — he takes the scooters home and plugs them in on his patio. His chargers are neatly organized, mounted to pieces of plywood with color-coordinated zip ties. They'll charge for hours, and he pays for the electricity. (The effect on his electric bill is negligible, Kirzner says.) The next morning, he'll wake up early to get the scooters out on the road, deposited in locations preselected by Bird, before he heads to his day job. Kirzner says that since he started charging in September, he's earned more than $9,000. He also cautions that this job is not very reliable — not like, say, driving for Uber or Lyft, or other options in the gig economy. Some nights he might come up empty-handed. And in some cities, Lime or Bird have folded up shop and disappeared overnight. It's also not clear if the companies will continue to rely on contractors. Other companies, such as Lyft, use employees to charge their electric scooters. Kirzner wonders how it can possibly be cost-effective to pay him $50 or $60 for a couple hours of work that a full-time employee might do for $15 an hour. More speculatively, some analysts suspect robots might be coming for these jobs — robot scooters, that is. ""What people are talking about already is having these things be autonomous,"" says Horace Dediu, the influential analyst who coined the term ""micromobility"" to describe small electric vehicles like scooters. A three-wheeled or self-balancing scooter could ""crawl around on the sidewalk at, like, 3 miles an hour,"" he says. ""Maybe during the night they'll reposition themselves to a charging station. Now, either you have a person there who plugs them in, or they could hover above what is essentially an inductive spot ... so they could self-charge."" ""So you'll have these these sort of armies of scooters rolling around the city at night roaming to try to find a charging station,"" Dediu theorizes. ""I think that's not crazy as it sounds."" After all, payouts to chargers such as Kirzner represent a substantial cost for the scooter companies — which are still burning through money as they expand, and haven't yet managed to turn a profit. But for now, chargers play an integral role in the scooter economy. In the chilly darkness, Kirzner carries his night's haul from his car and neatly lines them up. He says he makes decent pay at his 9-to-5 job. But a side hustle helps, he says. ""I have expensive rent, expensive car payments, cable bills,"" he says. ""You talk about the disappearing middle class — I feel like I'm in that zone where I can live fine, comfortably. But if you want to have a little more financial stability, this definitely helps."" And he'd rather do this than drive for Uber or Lyft, he says. It puts fewer miles on his car — and there are no drunk people to deal with. ""The Birds don't talk back to me,"" he says. ""They tweet every so often — you know, beeping — but other than that, they're pretty nice.""",https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/701130673/who-charges-all-those-electric-scooters-follow-a-nocturnal-juicer
Will Scootermania End With A Crash?,NPR,NPR,National,2019,3,14,"Will Scootermania End With A Crash? Electric scooters have invaded the world's cities. They whiz down streets and lie abandoned in the middle of sidewalks, bringing both convenience and annoyance to citydwellers. There are now dozens of scooter-sharing companies, and the two biggest, Bird and Lime, are the fastest startups to reach a valuation of $1 billion in U.S. history. Each company is now valued at over $2 billion. Scooteristas claim it's a sign that they're revolutionizing transportation, but... really? Scootermania Big Scooter argues that technology — electric motors, better batteries, GPS, and smartphones — has produced a system of shareable scooters that can solve infrastructure problems, decongest commutes, limit climate change, and make investors buckets of money. They're calling it the ""micromobility revolution."" Last year, there were 38.5 million trips on shareable e-scooters in the U.S., which is more than double the year before. The business model of these companies is pretty simple: flood a city with hundreds of scooters for passersby to rent. You can locate and pay for them using your smartphone, and they typically cost $1 plus 15 cents per minute. Then leave them wherever you want. Will Bird Economics Fly? At a couple bucks a ride, it takes about four to six months for companies just to break even on these scooters, and there's a big problem: the scooters aren't lasting that long. They're typically dead in less than a month or two. They get abused by riders who have no incentive to maintain them — and they literally get left out in the rain and cold. They're also vandalized by people who hate them. The Instagram account Bird Graveyard documents scooter destruction. It has more than 80,000 followers. In the rush to expand, companies have been using scooters that were not designed for commercial use. (Lime has had to recall theirs multiple times). Last week, Bird unveiled a new scooter, Bird One, which it claims will last ten months. Reports suggest that would be as much as ten times longer than their initial fleet lasted. Bird launched in late 2017 in Santa Monica, and there's since been a rush of companies into the global scooter market, including Uber, Lyft, and Ford. Even if scooter companies survive price wars and can start making a buck, there's a natural limit to how high their prices can go. If you really love scooting everywhere, you can buy a $300-$600 scooter yourself and save money. Scooter NIMBYs Like Uber, AirBnB, and other sharing revolutionaries, scooter companies have already faced political backlash in reliably outraged cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. They've proven annoying, even infuriating, to voters — and a regulatory clampdown has begun amid rising safety concerns. The city of Austin and the CDC recently released a study that found there were about 20 injuries per 100,000 scooter rides, and that half of these were head injuries that could have been avoided if riders were wearing helmets. Such findings could increase calls for helmet regulations, which could damage the convenience that is critical to the hop-on-and-hop-off scooter-sharing business. Part of the political appeal of shareable scooters is the idea that they're good for the environment, but that's still debatable. If motorized scooters are replacing cars, then it's clearly a win. But they may be mainly replacing biking and walking, which makes them a loss — especially in markets where the power used to charge these scooters comes from dirty power plants. A recent survey in Santa Monica, Bird's home, suggests that scooters there are replacing a good portion of car trips, but there is still no rigorous evidence to back claims that flooding cities with shareable scooters reduces carbon emissions. There is, however, evidence that to suggest it's wasteful because these scooters are dying so quickly. Unicorn Stampede Scootermania isn't just about scooters. It's about this entire bubbly era of tech. Tech watchers have come to call startups worth over a billion a ""unicorn."" At first it was because they were hard to find. Today, there are four times more unicorns than there were in 2013. Last year, VC funding for private companies hit a high of $131 billion, which is past the heights of the 1990s that ended in a crash in nominal terms and close to it in real ones. The percentage of companies going public — despite being unprofitable — has hit a similar peak. Uber, which remains unprofitable, became one of those companies last week. The money being poured into money-losing companies is driven by an ideology — sometimes called ""blitzscaling"" — that values growth over profit. It's a belief that winners take all because of dynamics like ""network effects,"" a notion that a good or service becomes more valuable to users as more people use it and that achieving scale is important because competitors won't be able to catch up. (Think Google vs other search engines). But it's not really evident that the scooter business is winner-take-all, especially because spotting them on the street and downloading a free app is relatively easy. Even the CEO of Bird seems to acknowledge this, telling The Information that he doesn't believe market share is important for scooter profitability. Instead, he says, what's important is to actually stop losing money every time they buy and rent out a scooter. Venture capitalists are now subsidizing consumers with billions and billions a year with the hope that the money-losing companies they back will become the next Google or Facebook. It has a bonus: you can now rent a scooter for a couple bucks courtesy of rich investors.",https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/05/14/723003882/will-scootermania-end-with-a-crash
Man dies 2 days after crashing scooter into tree in San Diego’s first such fatality,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,3,18,"Man dies 2 days after crashing scooter into tree in San Diego’s first such fatality. A 53-year-old man who crashed a rented scooter into a tree in downtown San Diego last week has died, becoming the city’s first electronic scooter fatality, police said Monday. The rider, identified as Christopher Conti of Woodstock, Ga., succumbed to his injuries Friday, San Diego police Sgt. Victoria Houseman said in a statement. Conti was headed north on the sidewalk of 10th Avenue near C Street shortly before 10 p.m. Wednesday when he failed to negotiate a left turn and struck a tree, police said. He was not wearing a helmet, Houseman said. It was not known if alcohol or drugs were factors. “This is the first known fatality in the city of San Diego involving a scooter,” Houseman said. The county’s first scooter death happened in December when Esteban Galindo, 26, was struck from behind by a car in Chula Vista. The driver involved stopped after the 4 a.m. crash. It’s unclear whether drugs or alcohol were factors. Dockless scooter companies, such as Lime and Bird, first showed up in San Diego in 2018. Initially, some companies also offered dockless bikes but that transportation option proved far less popular. Health officials reported seeing a surge in scooter-related injuries and began tracking statistics on the cases they treat. The city of San Diego is considering a slate of regulations on dockless electric scooters and bicycles that would address speed limits, parking restrictions and impose fees for company operating permits.",https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-diego-scooter-death-20190318-story.html
"Scooters Conquer Austin's SXSW, Beating Manhattan's Redline, More Miles Than To The Moon And Back",Forbes,,National,2019,3,19,"Scooters Conquer Austin's SXSW, Beating Manhattan's Redline, More Miles Than To The Moon And Back. During the first two weeks of March in Austin, Texas, dockless scooters propelled people almost 530,000 miles, a distance greater than to the Moon and back again, according to Jason JonMichael, an official with the Austin Transportation Department in a story posted by KLBJ News Radio. JonMichael told the Urban Transportation Commission that “…we are moving more people than the Redline in Manhattan moves in a month, which is the gold standard by which all transit lines in the rest of the United States are compared to.” Austin’s annual South by Southwest (SXSW) festival boosted electric scooter ridership during the first two weeks of the month 60% above a full month’s average of 300,000 miles. In spite of—or because of—the scooters’ success, Austin elected officials and regulators have been struggling to regulate the new mobility tools, with a new wave rules being slated for city council consideration on March 28. Concerns over helmet use as well as complaints from pedestrians, motorists and business owners have prompted the city to reduce the number of scooter operators while moving to reduce overall scooter numbers. The city is even partnering with the Centers for Disease Control on a study examining the health hazards of scooter use—as if common sense does not already tell us that zipping around on a sidewalk or the side of a road might increase the risk of bodily injury. Unfortunately, as with the use of helmets while operating a motorcycle—still optional in liberty-loving Texas—the cost of serious head injuries is all too often borne by taxpayers through the public health system. There’s a trend here. Austin essentially outlawed Uber and Lyft in 2016, though the Texas Legislature overruled it in 2017 and allowed them back in. And Austin has worked to put short-term rentals (Airbnb and similar services) on a path to extinction by 2022). These disruptive technologies have been tough for city government to come to grips with. And Austin’s answer, in each case of a technology it doesn’t understand, is to attempt to control it or even ban it. In a city dominated by an electorate drawn from the ranks of UT Austin, the burgeoning high-tech community, and state government employees, the Austin City Council sees itself as progressive. Thus, it has difficulty seeing the irony in its Luddite impulses which threaten to alienate younger residents who lean left but expect to enjoy the latest innovations. As ridesharing firms Uber and Lyft got off the ground in 2014, Austin’s highly regulated taxi industry mobilized its friends in government to neutralize the threat. The city council obliged by passing tough new ridesharing rules. Uber and Lyft countered by attempting to overturn the council’s regulation with a with a $9 million ballot initiative—the costliest in the city’s history. But when the effort failed, Uber and Lyft pulled out of the city—only to focus on making their case to the Texas State Legislature which passed a law in 2017 bringing rideshare regulations into uniformity across the Lone Star State. As Uber and Lyft returned to Austin, the city’s traditional cab companies quickly lost market share, with some owners being forced into bankruptcy. But even Uber and Lyft aren’t immune to creative destruction. By Spring of 2018, thousands of electric rental scooters made their appearance on Austin’s streets and sidewalks. Scooter operators include Bird, Jump, Lime, Lyft, and Spin. Ford bought Spin in November for $100 million. Jump is a project of Uber. By January of this year, more than a million rides had been logged by customers. Yet the city’s elected council and regulators warily eyed the new transportation mode and considered an ordinance to put limits on their use, while at the same time reducing the number of available scooters. At one point, 10 firms were licensed to deploy up to 500 devices downtown, with more slots available on the periphery, such as on the UT Austin campus. Scooter operator Lime was hit with an order to reduce its fleet by 1,000 scooters after being accused by the city of violating this downtown fleet limit. Lime says the violation was inadvertent, as users took the scooters downtown, violating the city’s 500 vehicle threshold. The city stopped licensing new scooters in January, with a city official saying the intent was to “limit the amount of chaos” during South by Southwest. Some cities in the U.S. and globally have moved to completely ban the devices. It’s true; some people do abuse scooters—just as they abuse cell phones by driving while distracted, and short-term rentals by throwing loud late-night parties. But there are already laws on the books that cover the potential problems with scooters. In their first 10 months of operation, dockless scooters generated 1,850 complaints out of 61,585 regarding nonemergency reports by the public, ranking 33rd on a list topped by missed garbage pickups (the city has a residential refuse collection monopoly) and loose dogs. Passing new ordinances to restrict the use of scooters may feed a desire to do something, but enforcement of laws on the books paired with education and a few prudent lawsuits would likely do as much (or more) to improve safety. In the meantime, the city of Austin is poised in 2020 to once again try to secure voter approval for a multibillion dollar bond for a fixed rail commuter system—a plan unlikely to be dropped or changed in light of the massive success dockless scooters saw last week at Austin’s SXSW.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckdevore/2019/03/19/scooters-conquer-austins-sxsw-beating-manhattans-redline-more-miles-than-to-the-moon-and-back/
The majority of scooters in LA are going to share your location with the city,Cnet,,National,2019,3,22,"The majority of scooters in LA are going to share your location with the city. For every three scooters that don’t share GPS data, 10 will. Los Angeles is pumping the brakes on scooter companies that won't tell it what part of the city you're wheeling around. Last September, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation said it would require all scooter companies to provide location data on the vehicles to help with city planning purposes. The data is collected by GPS on the scooters. ""Route information is provided to the city after the trip has completed and within 24 hours and it doesn't include the name, age, gender, address of the user,"" the agency said in a statement. ""LADOT is asking companies to provide the start trip and end trip of every vehicle as trips start and as trips end to make sure scooters are being parked legally and within the terms of the permit."" The requirement raised privacy concerns because sensitive data would be handled by the city government. The government partners with data aggregators, like Remix, to analyze that information. Privacy advocacy groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Technology and Democracy, have publicly spoken out about these data requests. ""We at Remix are excited to help LA and many other cities use data to make better decisions and empower micromobility programs to be successful in the context of the larger transportation ecosystem,"" Tiffany Chu, Remix's co-founder, said in a statement. It still isn't clear how long LADOT retains the location data, and there aren't public details on what aggregators can do with that information. What is clear: Companies that don't share the data won't be allowed to put as many scooters on the streets as those that do. Companies that declined to provide the data were given a 30-day provisional permit to operate in LA, which were handed out last week, while those that agreed to hand over anonymized location data received permits for a full year, Motherboard reported. LADOT is limiting more than the length of the permits given to companies concerned about privacy issues. It's also limiting the size of their fleets. The city is allowing Lyft, Uber and other companies that hesitate to share the data to operate only 3,000 scooters. Companies that offer the location data, like Lime and Spin, can grow to fleets with 10,500 scooters over the next year. That means LA residents will be more than three times as likely to ride a scooter providing the city government with location data, which critics say raises privacy concerns. ""LADOT is punishing businesses for standing up for the rights of customers while companies neglecting their responsibility to consumer privacy are being rewarded with exclusive financial opportunities,"" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. Spin said that cities need data to make streets safer but raised concerns that its agreement with LADOT could have privacy issues. ""We are alarmed when cities force operators to share sensitive location data with third-party for-profit data firms, without stipulating that the firms do not use that data to meet private business goals,"" a Spin spokesperson said. ""Going forward, we encourage LADOT to re-evaluate their third-party contracts to include strong safeguards for rider privacy."" Despite the disagreement, Spin said it still intends to provide its data to the city government. Lyft and Lime didn't respond to a request for comment. An LADOT spokesperson said Uber, Lyft and other companies can still apply for the full year's permit, which would grant them the same limits as rival scooter companies. All companies offering scooters must comply with the one-year permit requirements by April 15, the spokesperson said. It's unclear what Uber and Lyft will do after the deadline. An Uber spokesperson said the company would comply if LADOT had detailed, public plans on how it will protect that data from misuse. Location data is sensitive information, even if it's anonymized. A New York Times investigation found that people could still be identified through anonymized data by simply tracing specific commutes an individual would take. For example, it would be relatively easy to associate an individual to location data if it constantly showed someone at his or her home address. LADOT's plan to collect location data will likely expand beyond scooters. The agency hopes to collect location data on ride shares too. Uber has its own history of sidestepping city regulations. Two years ago the company used a tool called Greyball to thwart authorities looking for cars being driven for the company. While California has the toughest data privacy law in the US, the legislation doesn't apply to government agencies such as LADOT. The agency, in turn, gives that data to Remix, a private company, for analysis, creating another privacy concern. Remix said it's ""contractually obligated not to share that data"" but didn't provide details of its contract with LADOT.",https://www.cnet.com/news/the-majority-of-scooters-in-la-are-going-to-share-your-location-with-the-city/
"As Electric Scooters Proliferate, So Do Minor Injuries And Blocked Sidewalks",NPR,NPR,National,2019,3,30,"As Electric Scooters Proliferate, So Do Minor Injuries And Blocked Sidewalks. Dockless electric scooters are available for rent in dozens of U.S. cities. While the companies behind them are quick to extol their benefits, some health and safety experts are starting to see the challenges that come along for the ride. Scooter companies and city officials say they are aware of the issues, but solutions aren't coming anytime soon. Stand-up electric scooters have been around since the 1980s. But the latest trend in micromobility — dockless electric scooters — launched in 2017. They arrived in the District of Columbia in 2018, and now, just over a year later, thousands of scooters are on the streets. ""They sort of just popped up out of nowhere,"" says Matthew Lachance, who works in fundraising for an international AIDS relief nonprofit in D.C. Lachance says he rents scooters often, even throughout the winter, because they're fun and convenient. But not all rides are quite so fun. Some end in injuries. Fractures and head injuries most common Scooter-related injuries are a common sight at the George Washington University Hospital, says Dr. Kate Douglass. ""Almost during every shift, you'll see somebody come in with an extremity injury or a head injury or a laceration or something along those lines,"" she says. Douglass says that's partly to do with how riders actually use them. With riders in the streets, in the bike lanes and on the sidewalks, there's a greater potential for injury. Dr. Joann Elmore sees the same things in emergency rooms in Los Angeles. Elmore was the principal investigator on a team from the University of California, Los Angeles that looked at scooter injuries over their first year as a ride-share offering in L.A. In their study, published in January, they observed the most common injuries to be fractures and head injuries — about 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively. They also discovered that, of the scooter users they observed, fewer than 5 percent were wearing helmets. ""It is immensely easy to use and ... given this ease, many of us underestimate the potential for public health and trauma-related issues,"" she says. But even though injuries can be common, Douglass at George Washington says the injuries she's seeing are relatively minor — broken wrists and bruised knees. Severe injuries and even fatal injuries are far less common. And most injuries are preventable. Scooter companies part of the solution Injury prevention is also on the minds of micromobility companies. They are working to educate their users on how to ride safely through city streets. They're also working to educate users on where to leave scooters when they're no longer needed. Juliette Rizzo is a disability rights activist and pedestrian advocate who leads what are called ""walking audits."" The goal of the audits is to assess pedestrian access. In other words, what challenges stand in the way of safely navigating a city? During a recent walking audit in downtown D.C., Rizzo brought attention to a scooter found blocking the sidewalk. This prompted a conversation with Beaudry Kock, who was along for the audit. He works for Spin, one of the five companies with licenses to operate scooters in Washington. Kock voiced his frustration about scooter placement. ""There's no excuse. There's really no reason,"" he said. Kock said the responsibility of scooter placement is just as much on the companies as it is on the users. Ultimately, most of these companies feel that the best way to address all safety concerns is to push for long-term solutions — solutions like redesigning city streets and improving traffic flow for all vehicles, including bikes and scooters. The District Department of Transportation agrees. Jonathan Rogers, a policy analyst at DDOT, says that infrastructure and building safe streets are the foundation of tackling scooter-related issues. But improving infrastructure and building safer streets make for a slow and expensive process. The same could be said for building safer sidewalks. While temporary measures like flex posts and paint can help in the short term, most of the solutions are still months, if not years, away.",https://www.npr.org/2019/03/30/703102986/as-electric-scooters-proliferate-so-do-minor-injuries-and-blocked-sidewalks
Europe’s answer to Uber expands into the electric scooter scene in Madrid,CNBC,NBC,National,2019,4,2,"Europe’s answer to Uber expands into the electric scooter scene in Madrid. Bolt, formerly known as Taxify, is launching its electric kick scooter-sharing service in Madrid. The move marks another stepping stone in the start-up’s move toward new mobility options beyond car-hailing. The Estonia-based company is seeking to raise an additional round of funding from investors. t’s a phenomenon that’s seen wild popularity — and infamy — in some U.S. cities. Now, the electric scooter craze looks set to gain further ground in Europe. Estonian ride-hailing firm Bolt, formerly known as Taxify, is launching its electric kick scooter-sharing service in Madrid, following a rollout last year in Paris. Rides in the Spanish capital will cost 15 cents a minute, on top of a 1 euro minimum charge. Customers need to scan a QR code to unlock the scooters and can leave them on the street once a trip is complete. “Beating the traffic is a big issue in cities like Madrid and a lot of trips are much more efficiently covered with an electric scooter rather than a car with a driver,” Bolt co-founder and CEO Markus Villig said in a statement. “By bringing Bolt scooters to Madrid, we’re solving two things at once: reducing car rides as well as saving time and money for our customers.” The move marks another stepping stone in the start-up’s drive toward new mobility options beyond car-hailing. It recently went through rebranding, changing its name to Bolt, which is the same name it used for the Paris scooter service. It also mirrors Uber’s aim to become a one-stop shop for mobility. The ride-hailing giant made its own push into the e-scooter market last year following the acquisition of bike-sharing firm, Jump. Bolt is also looking to branch out into another key area for Uber — food delivery. It recently announced plans to launch a competitor to Uber Eats in Estonia, Finland and South Africa this summer. As it pushes toward a renewed focus on growth, Bolt is seeking to raise an additional round of funding from investors. It recently hired a new finance chief, former Spotify executive Johan Bergqvist, who will be tasked with overseeing fundraising efforts at the firm. The company hasn’t disclosed how much it’s looking to raise, nor who the investors will be. Bolt’s last big investment — which it secured last year when it was still known as Taxify — saw it raise $175 million at a $1 billion valuation. The company is backed by Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and German automaker Daimler, which itself owns a taxi hire app called MyTaxi. E-scooter craze The dockless e-scooter market has seen massive interest from investors, with serious cash being pumped into the likes of Lime and Bird. Lime recently closed a $310 million funding deal that values the firm at $2.4 billion, while Bird last year raised $300 million at a $2 billion valuation — the latter is also reportedly in talks to raise a further $300 million. But the battery-powered devices have seen some regulatory pushback in a number of cities, amid complaints that they are being ridden illegally on sidewalks and dumped in inappropriate places. San Francisco temporarily banned them last year, before granting permits to some start-ups in the space to let them resume operations. But Lime, Bird and Uber were refused licenses by the local authority.

"In some new cars and e-scooters, it isn't up to you how fast you drive",CNN,,National,2019,4,2,"In some new cars and e-scooters, it isn't up to you how fast you drive. Vehicles of all sizes, from Volvo SUVs to 25-pound electric scooters, are forcing their drivers to slow down. For years, drivers only had to fear the risk of a speeding ticket from an officer with a radar gun. Then came speed cameras that automatically mailed drivers tickets. Now a new trend is emerging: Speed caps, in which a vehicle's software restricts an engine or motor from accelerating past a predetermined threshold, are being built into cars, e-scooters and e-bikes to improve safety. Local governments and college campuses, from the District of Columbia, to San Diego and the University of Texas at Austin, are placing speed limits on rentable electric scooters and electric bikes, too. Vehicles that reach the cap plateau, and will go no faster. But some critics question if the caps are sensible and have warned of negative impacts. Volvo, which invented the modern seatbelt in the 1950s, is pushing ahead with the caps as part of its 2020 goal to end deaths and serious injuries in Volvos. Earlier this month, the company announced it would electronically limit its new sedans and SUVs to drive no more than 112 mph. No other automaker has matched Volvo's speed cap pledge, but others have their own higher speed caps for other reasons, such as tires that aren't recommended to go above 130 mph. ""The higher the speed, the higher the energy in the event of an accident,"" Volvo said in a statement. ""While capping the speed of our cars will not cure speeding, we have a responsibility to start a discussion about whether car makers have the right to use technology to alter consumer behavior."" It's also exploring caps to enforce lower speeds near schools and hospitals. Road safety advocates, who for years have warned that speeding raises the same dangers as drunk driving, are heartened by the changes. However, they say there's still much work to do, such as convincing the public that speeding is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. ""Nobody ever brings up speed,"" said Pam Fischer, a consultant who has spent much of her career in highway safety and is organizing a speed conference next month with the Governors Highway Safety Association and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. ""I say to people, 'What about speeding?' They look at me with blank stares,"" she said. Most of the world's largest automakers, including Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, Honda, Kia and Tesla, declined to comment on whether they'd follow in Volvo's footsteps, with the exception of Nissan, which said it had no plans to follow suit. A handful cited existing limits. BMW and Daimler said they cap their vehicles at 155 mph. GM and Honda said that their vehicles are capped at speeds depending on what the tires on each model are rated for, but declined to state the exact speeds. Tire-speed ratings vary from below 100 mph to more than 180 mph. Some critics question if a cap will improve safety. ""A cap at that speed is meaningless,"" said Alex Engel, a spokesman for the National Association of City Transportation Officials. ""A vehicle traveling 112 mph is incompatible with human life on city streets."" More impactful changes could be a few years away. The European Union is taking steps toward requiring intelligent speed assistance -- a technology that advises motorists of speed limits and may restrict them to it -- on new cars starting in 2022. But perhaps the largest impact of speed limiting is already playing out in micromobility, a term for person-sized vehicles such as electric bikes and electric scooters that have become popular in the last year. Governments nationwide say they're trying to figure out how to integrate the new devices into their neighborhoods. A number of safety issues have been raised, including improper parking and riding on the sidewalk. The District of Columbia requires e-scooter companies offering shared devices to limit their speed to 10 mph, while electric bikes are limited to 20 mph. The county of Arlington, Virginia also limits e-scooters to 10 mph. Across the country in San Diego, the city expects to enact rules in July that will limit scooters to 8 mph in areas with large pedestrian populations. In a handful of areas, it will cap the e-scooters at 3 mph and require operators to send a text message to riders telling them to exit the area after renting. However, scooter companies say speed limits can make it difficult for riders to keep up with the flow of traffic and may encourage them to ride illegally on the sidewalk, a location where they won't be surrounded by cars and trucks that move much faster. The companies prefer a speed limit of 15 mph. The University of Texas at Austin has taken a nuanced approach. This week it began capping the vehicles at 8 mph in popular pedestrian areas on campus, but makes an exception on a road that runs through campus, San Jacinto Boulevard. Because e-scooters mix with cars and trucks, the university felt it made sense to allow the scooters to also go 15 mph, the road's posted speed limit. The university said it may adjust the speed cap, depending on what it learns in the weeks ahead. ""Maybe it's 10 mph; maybe it's 9 mph. But for now, 8 mph seems like a good spot,"" said Bobby Stone, director of university parking and transportation services. The university's approach relies on geofencing, in which computerized location technologies, such as GPS and Bluetooth beacons, are used to identify a scooter's location and adjust its maximum speed. Other techniques to limit micromobilty speeds are being developed. At least one Silicon Valley startup, lvl5, is experimenting with using cameras mounted on the devices to identify sidewalks or roads with artificial intelligence, and adjust speeds accordingly. Jonathan Freeman, a 66-year-old San Diego resident, worries the rise of micromobility will make sidewalks unsafe. He's organized a group called Safe Walkways that lobbies local and state legislature for regulations of e-scooters. San Diego has about 20,000 shared micromobility devices, according to the local government. ""We're all in fear of this coming summer when the tourists come back en masse, and we're inundated with more people misbehaving and using these vehicles inappropriately,"" Freeman said. Nancy Fairfield, a 77-year-old San Diego resident, used to walk weekly with her friends on the boardwalk. They've moved their walks to the beach in the last year, given concerns about being hit by an e-scooter. She's not convinced the new regulations will be enforced and effective. ""Our city council doesn't have the guts to do anything,"" said Fairfield, referencing what she considers a long-running lack of boardwalk rules. Bicycles are already allowed on the boardwalk, which adds to the traffic. ""We know there will be growing pains, but thousands of people are riding these things. Anytime we get somebody out of car and on scooter, that's better for everybody,"" said Greg Block, a spokesman for San Diego's government, who sees the devices as a good way to explore the city and limit traffic congestion. Some road experts say addressing scooter safety needs to be part of a larger conversation about speed. Jurisdictions that have required electronic speed limits to be built into electric scooters and bikes haven't made the same request of shared cars. Lime, a San Francisco-based transportation startup that rents a variety of vehicles types, isn't required by law to govern the speed of its cars, the heaviest and fastest vehicles in its fleet. ""Your biggest threat as a pedestrian or bicyclist isn't a scooter. It's a traditional car,"" said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, adding that there are about 10,000 speed-related car and truck deaths every year. ""But for whatever reason these scooters and new mobility devices have drawn everyone's attention.""",https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/tech/speed-cars-scooters-bikes/index.html
Inboard refunds electric scooter customers as it pivots to shared fleets,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,4,9,"Inboard refunds electric scooter customers as it pivots to shared fleets. The electric skateboard startup’s first scooter will now only be available in fleets starting this summer. Electric skateboard startup Inboard Technology no longer plans to sell its upcoming Glider electric scooter directly to consumers. Instead, the company will focus on selling fleets of the scooter to businesses and transportation companies to be used on campuses, at resorts, or on city streets in both docked and dockless configurations. All customers who plunked down a $349 deposit for the $1,299 electric scooter will be refunded, the company says. Those refunds will start going out today to the 1,500 people who put down deposits, according to Inboard, and they will all be processed by April 15th. The scooter, now called the G1 Glider, was originally supposed to launch in February. The company’s new direction will start to take shape when Inboard announces its first partnership with a large transportation company later this year, CEO Ryan Evans tells The Verge. The startup will also work with “much smaller operators of fleets that include hotels, resorts, corporate campuses, and business parks,” he says. To handle the demand for this newly focused push on providing fleets of scooters, Evans says Inboard will partner with “one of the world’s leading contract manufacturers,” though he declined to name which one. Inboard arrived on the scene in late 2015 / early 2016, and it was one of the first to seriously compete with fellow California-based startup Boosted’s popular electric skateboard. Inboard’s M1 matched Boosted’s board on specs, while also offering a few key advantages, including in-wheel motors (which let users ride more freely when the board isn’t under power) and a swappable battery that can be quickly popped out of the deck for a fresh one. Inboard promised its electric scooter would offer those same advantages when it announced the product last September. It also said the scooter would have a wide deck with big wheels and a coiled suspension to make for smooth, easy riding and that it would be rugged enough to handle the demands of riding through rough city terrain — potentially solving one of the main pain points for early shared scooters, which tended to wear out quickly since they weren’t made for fleet use. That’s all still true; the scooter itself is not changing. It will still have a top speed of 22 miles per hour, a 12-mile battery life, a kickstand, and a quick-folding mechanism. It will also be connected, thanks to Bluetooth, cellular, and GPS chips. “Inboard’s goals remain the same,” Evans says. “We want to build the most iconic and beautiful products in the category, and we believe we can continue to do that with the core technology we have.” What will change is how Inboard’s scooter becomes available to people. Instead of owning the scooter outright, riders will now find Inboard’s scooter as part of fleets operated by other companies. The company had teased this idea alongside the announcement of its scooter as a consumer product last September, but now it’s the full focus. (The M1 skateboard will remain a direct-to-consumer product, though.) “We realized if we really want to have a big impact on the future of personal mobility, part of it is going to be in the fleet space, and that’s something we can do now with really big partners,” Evans says, adding that it’s “the best way to get so many people on [Inboard’s scooter] so quickly.” He also believes it’s the best option for Inboard’s business, at least in the near term. The company has raised about $12 million to date, but even that might be enough to fully fund a shift into mass-producing scooters for individual sales, according to Evans. “The working capital [required] is crazy, to be able to scale to make thousands of scooters. It’s a much more challenging business than B2B,” he says. Selling scooters in a B2B will also make it possible for the company to more quickly turn a profit, Evans says. Much like how Inboard followed companies like Boosted and Zboard into the electric skateboard space, it will be far from the first company to power fleets of electric scooters. In just a year and a half, startups like Bird and Lime have spread the idea of shared electric scooters so far and so fast that each company is now valued at over $2 billion. Evans isn’t intimidated by those massive valuations, though. Instead, he says they’re a sign that there’s lots of room for other companies to play in this space. “Bird and Lime were really kind of the signal flares that showed wow, this is a cornerstone of transportation,” he says. “It went from ‘electric skateboards are cute little toys,’ to ‘holy shit, electric scooters are going to be de facto for the industry.’” Besides, Evans says, Inboard is taking a different approach that won’t directly compete with Bird and Lime. “Their goal is to make money off of every ride. And our goal is to make money selling hardware to companies,” he says. “We don’t look at ourselves as competing with Bird and Lime, but rather being a kind of new addition or replacement to or extension of these sharing programs.” In other words, Inboard doesn’t want to be too involved with the day-to-day management of its scooters once they’ve been sold. It will be up to the companies or businesses that buy Inboard’s scooters to decide if they want to charge people to use them. Inboard will offer an API that lets bigger companies tie their existing apps and fleet management systems to the data coming off the scooters. Inboard will also offer a turnkey software solution for smaller companies that don’t have the resources to build out an app or management system for a few dozen scooters. And it’s developing docks for customers who want a more locked-down solution, though Evans says he believes a hybrid model of docked and dockless scooters is the future. Bird launched an enterprise solution of its own in March in three countries, and both it and Lime have been working to fill their fleets with more rugged scooters that will also help them diversify from China’s Ninebot, a major supplier. Evans believes the company’s more narrow B2B approach will help carve out a chunk of the market, which, someday, could allow Inboard to turn its attention back to direct-to-consumer products. “I think that’s an important distinction. We don’t want to operate anything,” Evans says. “I never want to fish a G1 out of a river to try to refurbish it. I’m totally comfortable selling you a replacement at that point.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18301144/inboard-electric-scooter-refunds-customers-shared-fleets-pivot
New app shows you all the e-scooters nearby in one handy map,Mashable,,National,2019,4,10,"New app shows you all the e-scooters nearby in one handy map. Bird, Lime, Spin, Jump, Lyft. The list goes on — these are the many electric scooter options you can rent in various cities throughout the U.S. For each company offering rentals to ride the electric two-wheelers, there's an accompanying app with its own map showing where (just) its scooters are located. And then there's Scooter Map, first created last year to help contract workers known as ""chargers"" find scooters they would bring home to charge up in return for a payment. Site creator Victor Pontis said in an email that his map has connected 60,000 chargers to scooters that need more juice. As of Wednesday, the app can now tell not only chargers but also riders the location of nearby scooters, all on one map. The map also shows battery level and which company the scooter is from. A toggle on the map switches it from ""rider"" to ""charger"" mode. The map app combines a lot of options, which is an approach that ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft are also using, and adding more transit options to the platform. Now through the Uber app you can order a car like usual, or rent an e-bicycle or e-scooter. Uber's CEO said last year he wants the company to be the ""Amazon of transportation."" Lyft offers a similar one-app system where it has scooters and bikes available. But each still only shows its own products available for rent. Google Maps has attempted to incorporate the efficiency of Scooter Map with its Lime e-scooter integration. Within the navigation app you can see where Lime vehicles are available and start the mobile process of reserving and unlocking the device. But again, this is limited to one scooter company; you can't see other options. The Scooter Map app is free to download, and you won't find any ads splashed above the map or anything, but Pontis does offer a premium version for chargers. For $10 per month, chargers can get notifications, GPS history, and access to an online charger community. With Scooter Map instead of a whole folder on your phone devoted to countless apps, you can finally see them all in one place.",https://mashable.com/article/scooter-map-app-e-scooter-lime-bird/
Electric scooters have zipped by docked bikes in popularity,AP,,National,2019,4,17,"Electric scooters have zipped by docked bikes in popularity. Love them or hate them, electric scooters are everywhere — zipping along city streets and littered on sidewalks, to the dismay of pedestrians and drivers who must share the road. And now they have overtaken station-based bicycles as the most popular form of shared transportation outside transit and cars in the U.S. According to a new report released Wednesday by the National Association of City Transportation Officials, riders took 38.5 million trips on shared electric scooters in 2018, eclipsing the 36.5 million trips on shared, docked bicycles. Riders also took trips on 3 million dockless pedal bikes, which can be picked up and dropped off anywhere, and 6.5 million dockless electric bikes in 2018, but the report notes those numbers are declining. One reason for electric scooters’ fast growth: companies are jockeying for strategic position in the so-called micromobility revolution, where consumers are embracing shared scooters and bikes for short trips and exploring alternatives to car ownership buoyed by the ubiquity of smartphones. Riders took 84 million trips on micromobility services in 2018, more than double the number from the year before, according to the report. Electric scooters helped drive that trend, with more than 85,000 of them available for public use in the U.S. compared with 57,000 station-based bikes. To be sure, scooter companies face challenges from every direction, including vandalism, theft, rider injuries, intense competition and aggressive regulations in cities across the country. Yet the industry persists and venture capitalists, ride-hailing companies and traditional auto manufacturers have poured millions of dollars into the fledgling business. The original bike-share systems in the U.S. developed after cities invited them in, said Kate Fillin-Yeh, director of strategy for the National Association for City Transportation Officials. “In the last year-and-a-half, it’s a very different animal,” she said. “The companies are in some cases trying to beat each other to the market.” Bird, a Santa Monica-based scooter company launched in late 2017, raised $418 million and rang up more than 10 million rides in its first year. Lime, which offers shared bikes and scooters, clocked more than 12 million rides and $467 million in investment in its first 15 months. Car manufacturers and ride-hailing companies are taking notice, and some have made their own plays in the space with larger ambitions than scooters alone. Uber bought Jump Bikes, an electric bike and scooter company that operates in about two dozen cities, and last year it invested $30 million in Lime, which is in more than 100 cities worldwide. Ford, which bought scooter company Spin in November, said deploying electric scooters will help the company eventually roll out autonomous vehicles by building critical relationships with U.S. cities as they work together to craft regulations and build out infrastructure. “In this next revolution of micromobility, the cities are taking a more active stance in how they’re going to participate,” Sunny Madra, vice president of Ford’s mobility businesses, told The Associated Press late last year. “By doing this now in advance of autonomous programs and other forms of mobility that will come up, this is a great way for us to make sure that we’re a part of the transformation of mobility.” If it seems like electric scooters popped up overnight, that’s because they did. Several companies distributed them throughout cities without permission or permits, reminding local officials of when ride-hailing companies such as Uber launched in their markets years ago without warning. But cities learned from that experience and have been more aggressive about regulating scooters. San Francisco, for instance, kicked out Bird, Lime and Spin and instituted a competition for permits, ultimately awarding them to relative underdogs Scoot and Skip and capping the number of scooters they could deploy. New York City does not allow shared electric scooters, although legislation has been introduce to change the rule. As a condition for operating there, many cities are requiring scooter companies to share their troves of location data, which show where the scooters are and the routes they take. That can be valuable to plan bike routes and docking stations or to understand traffic patterns. It also raises questions about user privacy. The location data provided to cities is not linked to names, emails or other directly identifiable information, but “if you take enough GPS data points and begin attaching other data sets, it can be used to identify specific individuals,” said Regina Clewlow, CEO of Populus, a company that helps cities securely access data for policy and planning while protecting privacy. Another consequence of electric scooters is head injuries. Dr. Vishal Bansal, director of trauma surgery at Scripps Mercy Hospital San Diego, noticed many riders were getting on scooters at night intoxicated, without wearing a helmet, taking “30, 40 years of what we’ve learned about injury prevention and has just thrown it out the window,” he said. “If your head hits concrete at 20 miles an hour, you are not going to get up,” said Christopher Ziebell, emergency room medical director at Dell Seton Medical Center in Austin. “These have little tiny wheels on them, so it doesn’t take much for a rider to go flying off.” Some industry watchers wonder how long the electric scooter phenomenon will last. Veteran auto analyst Maryann Keller calls the billion-dollar valuations that have been reported for some scooter companies nonsensical. Scooters are a capital-intensive business, and there are few ways to differentiate from competitors’ models, making it hard for companies to stand out, she said. “These little fads come and go,” Keller said. For those wishing for the scooter fad to go, they might have to wait a little longer.",https://apnews.com/deec1b3bc84e41b88fb41aba0ea83c16
Lime’s electric scooters will be able to tell when you’re too drunk to ride,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,4,17,"Lime’s electric scooters will be able to tell when you’re too drunk to ride. Talking scooters and safety with co-founder Brad Bao. Lime co-founder and executive chairman Brad Bao chatted with The Verge’s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel and senior transportation reporter Andrew J. Hawkins about what’s next for the e-scooter revolution in this week’s Vergecast interview. Bao discussed how scooter-sharing companies could better promote safety without compromising the convenience, as well as how his company is protecting its customers’ private data. You can listen to the discussion in its entirety on The Vergecast right now. Below is a lightly edited excerpt from this interview regarding some of Bao’s ideas about how to keep drunk riders from using Lime’s scooters. Andrew J. Hawkins: Is there an innovative way of looking at how you can promote safety in a way that you know encourages people to use helmets while also not making it a less convenient service to use? Brad Bao: Safety is the number one thing for us as a company and I think that when it comes to mobility, safety is the baseline. Without that, nothing matters. And that’s why we focus so much on it. In the mobility space, I think safety is a result of a combination of different things. In this case, we are not only doing our part, but also working very proactively and aggressively with authorities, and with cities, with urban planners. On the hardware side, that’s the reason that we built a very extensive team in working on the customized hardware, to improve on hardware and also our own operations. On the other hand, we launched a Respect the Ride campaign and devoted over $3 million for marketing, outreach, and education, and we gave away more than 250,000 helmets to help improve safety. We are sharing data proactively. Sharing that data with the city, it helped them to do better priorities where that bike lane should be. How wide it will be. And we can share them with the data. We have seen very positive change in many cities that we were working with, in Paris, Austin, Seattle, Portland, you name it. Many cities have been leveraging the data we shared and started putting in improved infrastructures. On the technology side, with a connected service like ours, there’s so much more we can do. Working on drunk driving detections, we can just slow down the vehicle where we detect an irregular driving. Nilay Patel: You have a Breathalyzer? No, I think there are better ways to do it. Take one thing, for example. Our scooters have all kinds of sensors that can sense whether it’s driving in a straight line or whether it’s wobbling. We do the warning. We can slow it down. We’re still working on it. It’s not launched, but that’s an example of many things that we’re improving right now on the issue of data. Andrew J. Hawkins: I’m glad you brought that up because as I’m sure you know, there’s this issue going on right now in the city of Los Angeles where they’re fighting a couple of the scooter companies on access to more location-based data. What’s Lime’s stance on this? Data and privacy is another very key thing for us as a company. That’s a responsibility we have for the users as well as for cities and communities as well. We’re working with the city of LA on data standards. I think there’s always a balance we have to strike. The demand for the city side and the protection of the users. And what do we think makes the most sense as to how we utilize that data. What matters and what does not. That for urban planning, for monitoring the traffic, that, I think, is very valuable that we share that data with the city, helping them to further improve urban transportation. In this case, that is not a one company or city alone that can do this. It is a combination of things and the cooperation among us. We should share where the traffic patterns are, and when and where most of the trips happen, but we don’t need to and the city does not need to know who is the individual that took those trips. Aggregate data that does help our urban planning side, and helping to fight the traffic congestion. But that’s not necessary to reveal that user and privacy identities.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411127/lime-brad-bao-electric-scooter-drunk-detection-vergecast
"In Australia, hacked Lime scooters spew racism and profanity",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,4,24,"In Australia, hacked Lime scooters spew racism and profanity. The global scooter giant said the attack was ‘not funny.’ The video is straight out of a goofy, low budget horror movie: A row of bright-green Lime scooters, parked neatly on a sidewalk, have come to life, unleashing a filthy flush of human speech. Delivered in Australian-sounding accents, the voices wail, make sexual demands and spew profanity upon anyone who nears them. ""Don’t take me around, because I don’t like to be ridden,” one of the least offensive scooters is saying in a video published online. It’s not a modern twist on Christine, the Stephen King novel — and subsequent 1983 horror flick — about a car possessed by a demonic spirit out for revenge. Instead, it’s the latest bit of bad fortune to befall Lime, the global scooter giant that has spent much of the last year spreading across the world and simultaneously battling negative headlines and head-scratching setbacks. Since last summer alone, Lime scooters have caught fire, broken apart in use, and been recalled after a technical bug caused “sudden excessive braking during use.” The company said the latest incident — which affected eight scooters in Brisbane, Australia — was caused by a hacker who penetrated the scooter’s audio files. “We are aware that a few Lime scooters in Brisbane have had their audio files changed by vandals recording over the existing audio file with inappropriate and offensive speech,"" the company said in a statement. ""It’s not smart, it’s not funny and is akin to changing a ringtone."" ""It’s disappointing that someone has taken this opportunity to poke fun at members of the community in a hurtful way that is so far removed from the values we hold as a company,” the statement added. Despite being unsettling, the hacking did not appear to put riders at any physical risk. Lime said vandals did not access the compromised scooters operating system, but instead physically broke into the vehicle’s audio file port, an act akin to changing the ringtone on your phone. The company said modifying a scooter’s operating system would require intimate knowledge of its software and engineering, expertise that’s limited to a handful of people in the world. Nevertheless, some experts have raised concerns about the potential for e-scooters operating systems to be hacked, putting riders in grave danger. In February, researchers at the security firm Zimperium carried out a demonstration showing how a hacker could remotely lock a Xiaomi M365 scooter, causing a rider to stumble into traffic. In a statement online, the researchers said a potential hacker — using a Bluetooth-enabled app from nearly 330 feet away — could lock a scooter, deploy malware that could take full control of a device or target an individual rider, causing their scooter to unexpectedly brake or accelerate. “Losing control of your scooter mid traffic can be lethal,” the video notes.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/24/australia-hacked-lime-scooters-spew-racism-profanity/
"E-scooters aren't going anywhere — in fact, their numbers are still growing",Mashable,,National,2019,4,25,"E-scooters aren't going anywhere — in fact, their numbers are still growing. The number of scooters in cities around the world is quickly growing. Though communities like San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif. limited the number of scooters companies could offer for rent last year, other cities are still seeing a major increase in the number of available electric two-wheelers. On Thursday, Lime announced that its scooters and bicycles reached 50 million trips since launching mid-2017. That's enough mileage to circle the globe 2,000 times. Those trips come from a growing, global bike- and-scooter share network that reaches 100 cities in more than 20 countries, and five continents. The latest places Lime e-scooters have landed: Bogota, Colombia and Montevideo, Uruguay. Lime also said its had more than 15 million sign-ups. In the U.S., Austin, San Diego, and Atlanta are just some of the cities where you can find scooters from a wide range of rental companies like Bird, Lime, Uber's Jump, Lyft, Bolt, Ford's Spin, and others. Portland, Oregon, is launching a new yearlong pilot Friday after the success of a smaller one last year. The program will start with 2,500 scooters and could increase by the end of the year to 15,000. Even San Francisco last week doubled the fleet size for the two e-scooter operators allowed in the city. The National Association of City Transportation Officials, which tracks shared micromobility usage throughout the U.S., puts 38.5 million trips on e-scooters in 2018, surpassing bike-share trips (36.5 million trips) for the first time. Throughout 100 U.S. cities NACTO tallied about 85,000 e-scooters available for rent. Other companies are moving beyond American cities, like Bird throughout Europe and in Tel Aviv. Scoot — known for both its red e-scooters and electric mopeds — expanded to Santiago, Chile, and Barcelona, Spain last year, moving well beyond the confines of San Francisco. Madrid has 18 different e-scooter-share companies operating within city limits. In Singapore, 14 scooter companies have applied to bring its fleets there. William Henderson, CEO and co-founder of Ride Report, a software system that connects cities with scooter operators and scooter data, has watched bicycle advocacy fight for space and infrastructure in cities over the years, but with scooters, ""all of a sudden we have this tremendous growth."" After working with different cities, he's seen demand for scooter-share services continue and not just blip out after the first few months. ""This is serving a real need to get around cities efficiently and affordably,"" he added. Lime also released more demographics about its U.S. riders, like how 33 percent are female and 36 identifying as people of color. One-third of Lime riders earn $50,000 or less, according to its rider reports. A survey of San Francisco scooter riders (on Skip and Scoot vehicles only) released last week at city program's mid-way point found some different breakdowns, with scooter-riders 82 percent male, 63 percent white, and 68 percent with an income of more than $100,000.",https://mashable.com/article/lime-escooters-growth-us-global/
Map: Watch the electric scooter boom spread across the U.S.,NBC News,NBC,National,2019,4,27,"Map: Watch the electric scooter boom spread across the U.S. E-scooters, the newest entrant in the two-wheeled transportation business, burst onto streets across the country in 2018. From Santa Monica to Miami and from Portland, Oregon, to Providence, R.I., electric scooters kicked expansion into high gear, covering sidewalks and streets across the country in 2018. Since then, e-scooter companies have gone international, expanding into locations from Australia and Latin America to Israel. How did these companies grow so much so fast? Scooter companies leveraged investor money and smartphone technology-as-inventory-control to expand rapidly, going from fewer than five to more than 70 cities in 2018. The map below shows just how quickly that expansion took place. The dockless scooters, which riders can rent with a smartphone app and park almost anywhere, became polarizing after popping up in earnest last summer. Transit advocates hailed how easy the scooters were to use and their potential to decrease road congestion by providing an alternative to cars and taxis for short trips. Critics complained of riders speeding through sidewalks and of parked scooters cluttering cities. And hospitals saw a rise in scooter-related injuries. Scooter operators aggressively expanded using moves from ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft’s playbooks (note that Uber acquired e-scooter company Jump in August 2018 and Lyft launched its own e-scooter service in September), often launching fleets in cities before securing permits in the hope that riders would pressure local politicians into greenlighting their use. That approach paid off. Bird and Lime, the two largest operators, both reached $1 billion valuations within a year of launching their companies. It also drew pushback from municipal governments. Several cities, including San Francisco, Austin, Texas, and Indianapolis, either banned scooters outright or issued temporary injunctions before rolling out limited pilot programs. In January, accessibility advocates sued the city of San Diego and three e-scooter companies over the hazard the vehicles on sidewalks presented to the disabled. Also in January, Denver introduced regulations requiring scooter riders to ride only on the street. But the scooters proved popular with the public. Riders in Santa Monica, California, which introduced a scooter pilot in fall 2018, took 150,000 trips in November 2018. And in Denver, a poll conducted by the city’s public works department found that 55 percent of respondents had a positive opinion of the scooters. The scooter companies have since set their sights abroad. Bird, Lime and an e-scooter company founded in 2011 named Scoot, have all launched in cities in Europe and Latin America. Bird has launched in Tel Aviv in Israel, while Lime has started operations as far away as Australia and New Zealand. Bird has also signaled intentions to invest in public bike lanes. In August, the company announced plans to fund protected bike lanes in its cities of operation. And in January, TechCrunch reported that Bird chief executive Travis VanderZanden told an audience at a Los Angeles technology conference that he expected to focus more on infrastructure in 2019. “The deeper I get into transportation, the more I realize we don’t need autonomous vehicles, we don’t need tunnels, all we need are more bike lanes,” VanderZanden said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/e-scooters-expansion-map-n998106
Madrid Is Trying Out E-Scooters in Its Quest to Beat Traffic,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2019,4,30,"Madrid Is Trying Out E-Scooters in Its Quest to Beat Traffic. The city has 5,000 Vespa-style bikes on the streets as operators use it as a testing ground. Growing up, Javier Asensio rode the bus to school and around town on weekends. Then, when car-sharing arrived in Madrid a few years ago, he started driving more frequently. But for the past year he’s shifted to another option: electric scooters in a rainbow of bright colors available across the city. “Scooters are by far my first choice,” says the 27-year-old management consultant. “Traffic and parking are easy, and I love riding them.” A half-dozen companies have flooded Madrid with electric versions of Vespa-type sit-down scooters. Riders pick them up and drop them off anywhere in the city center and surrounding areas, paying about 25¢ per minute. They’re booked and billed via a smartphone app, which can guide users to the nearest bike, track how long they’ve been riding, and e-mail a bill moments after they park. The city has about 5,000 scooters, up fivefold from a year ago—the world’s biggest fleet, says Enrico Howe, an analyst at mobility consulting firm MotionTag. Madrid is “the capital of scooter-sharing globally,” he says. For Madrid, it makes sense. The city has long struggled with soul-crushing traffic and the resulting noise, pollution, and productivity loss. The government has fought back with various measures: electric car-sharing, zones where combustion engines face restrictions, and a proposal for free Metro rides on particularly bad days. E-scooters will be an integral part of the strategy, and Madrid wants to make them easier to find and ride, says Paz Valiente, the local official responsible for mobility. The city has made it legal for scooters to use bus lanes, allowed them to push ahead of cars at traffic lights, and is seeking to expand the areas where they can be used. “Car-sharing introduced people to electric mobility and shared vehicles,” Valiente says. “Now that’s helping boost the expansion of scooters.” For the companies that provide the services, Madrid has become a testing ground as they eye expansion across Europe and beyond. The city’s dry climate and compact-but-congested center make it a good place to try out equipment and better understand what users want. And with so many operators jumping into the market, they’ll all be forced to hone their efficiency if they hope to survive, says Luis González, head of the local operations of Coup, a unit of Germany’s Robert Bosch GmbH that arrived in Madrid last year. This year, Coup expects to increase its fleet in the city by 60 percent, to more than 1,300 bikes. “With so much competition, the bar is higher,” he says. “The lessons we learn in Madrid will be surely applied elsewhere.” In many ways, electric technology is a better fit for two-wheelers than for cars and trucks, making shared scooters a harbinger of things to come. Cars weigh at least 10 times as much as the passengers they carry, but scooters are about the same weight as a person, so riders haul less metal as they move through the city. Scooters are more nimble and take up less space, both when moving and when parked. Few people use them for much other than commuting, largely eliminating range anxiety. And the batteries are small enough to carry inside overnight for charging, so the lack of a garage or designated refueling point isn’t a problem. “We don’t need to bring the bikes to recharging stations,” says Ramón Piñeiro, head of new business at Acciona SA, a Spanish construction giant that last year introduced a scooter service in the capital and today has a fleet of 1,000. “We just take a van out and swap the batteries wherever they are.” hyperdrive-tout-final The scooter companies are starting to encounter hurdles, though, particularly competition from other electric two-wheelers. The city runs its own service of pedal-assisted e-bicycles, BiciMAD, which has 2,500 bikes on the streets and 70,000 users. And the city has issued permits for 10,000 electric stand-up scooters. About 20 companies, including Acciona, Lime, and Jump Uber have applied for them, and hundreds of the scooters have already popped up on the streets. Both of those alternatives are cheaper to buy and operate than sit-down scooters—though they don’t go quite as fast and they’re more easily damaged. María Eugenia López Lambas, a professor at Polytechnic University of Madrid, says that if the growth rate continues, all of the options are likely to face new rules. “Regulation today is meant to encourage this kind of service,” she says. “But some kind of restrictions will be needed if they keep expanding.” BOTTOM LINE - With their light weight and small size, scooters offer fewer concerns about parking and range, making them better suited to electric technology than cars are.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-30/madrid-is-trying-out-e-scooters-in-its-quest-to-beat-traffic
You can now rent a Bird electric scooter for $25 a month,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,4,30,"You can now rent a Bird electric scooter for $25 a month. The company will even deliver the scooter right to your front door. If using an app to track down a nearby electric scooter to rent is too much of a crapshoot, Bird is now offering monthly rentals of its battery-powered two-wheelers for a flat rate of $24.99. The company will even deliver the scooter right to your front door, and pick it up when you’re done. The catch is you have to live in San Francisco or Barcelona to sign up for a month-long rental of a Bird scooter. The new service is only launching in those two cities, though if all goes well, the company expects to roll it out in other markets at a later date. Bird first announced its plan for a new concierge service last October. Now it appears Bird Delivery is being coupled with monthly personal rentals to sweeten the deal. Here’s how it will work, according to the company: Available soon in San Francisco and Barcelona, people can open the Bird app and enter information such as where and when they would like their Bird delivered (home, work, elsewhere). After your order is placed, a Bird representative will follow up to confirm details and arrange for a personal Bird, charger, and lock to be delivered. When your rental period expires, Bird will come and pick up the vehicle, charger, and lock from your location. In some respects, this is a clever way around San Francisco’s current rules prohibiting all scooter companies except two — Scoot and Skip — from offering dockless e-scooters for rent. The policy, which was enacted in August 2018, was seen as a rebuke to Bird and Lime for dumping their scooters on the sidewalks of San Francisco in 2017 without first seeking the city’s permission. Bird’s delivery service avoids the problem of obtaining a permit from the city to operate a dockless scooter-sharing service by becoming a concierge service instead. Currently, Bird’s normal dockless scooters are $1 to unlock (using an app) and then 10-30 cents for every minute of riding. It’s an interesting twist in the fast-paced shared scooter market, which has so far prioritized ubiquity over convenience. But scooter companies aren’t just competing with each other; they are also competing with ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft. Right now, anyone can summon a car to their location with just the tap of a button. With scooter services like Bird, there is some hide-and-seek involved, as riders need to locate the closest scooter using the scooter’s GPS device and the app’s tiny map. Bird is aiming to cut through some of that inconvenience with its new delivery service.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona
"Paris bans e-scooters from sidewalks, citing rise in accidents",CNN,,National,2019,5,4,"Paris bans e-scooters from sidewalks, citing rise in accidents. France will ban electric scooters from its sidewalks from September, after locals grew frustrated with the vehicles congesting public areas and causing an increase in accidents. Paris and other cities have become home to thousands of e-scooters since their introduction just a year ago, with several companies operating scooter-sharing systems in the capital. But their use has caused tensions with residents, and France's transport minister admitted they have resulted in accidents. ""The development of these (scooters) was very rapid and a little anarchic. We didn't see it coming and it became the law of the jungle,"" Elisabeth Borne told Le Parisien. ""And it is true that we are seeing an increase in accidents and but also an increasing sense of unease on our pavements."" Borne announced riders will be fined 135 euros ($150) from September if they use e-scooters on sidewalks. ""Our main objective is that pedestrians no longer walk the pavements in fear of getting run down,"" she said, adding that operators were themselves calling for ""good practice rules"" and for clarifications about how the vehicles could be used. US start-up Lime, which manages an e-scooter network in various cities and allows people to rent the vehicles through an app, has aggressively entered the European market in the past year, with Paris as one of its flagship locations. It has been followed by companies including Tier, Bird and Uber offshoot Jump. Several e-scooter renting apps operate in Paris. But questions have been raised over the safety of the products, and earlier this week, a highly anticipated US study found especially high rates of accidents among new riders. One in three injured riders were hurt on their first trip and about 63% had ridden nine times or fewer before their injury, the study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Texas' Austin Public Health Department found. The researchers concluded that additional training may be necessary for e-scooter riders.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/paris-electric-scooters-ban-intl/index.html
Can Bird build a better scooter before it runs out of cash?,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,5,5,"Can Bird build a better scooter before it runs out of cash? A year ago, Bird Rides Inc. was flying high — and Silicon Valley was betting that it would keep on climbing. Thousands of the Santa Monica start-up’s signature black-and-white scooters appeared on street corners across the world, bought with venture capital and rented to smartphone-toting riders. Investors saw how quickly riders took to the new mode of transit, and visions of Uber-size growth and revenues flitted through their heads. In March 2018, just six months after the first Bird hit the pavement, venture funds poured in $100 million. In June, they dumped an additional $300 million. Bird’s valuation soared to $2 billion in a matter of months. But today, facing a crowded field of competitors, pushback and fees from local governments, and fundamental questions about whether any company can make money by releasing electric scooters into the wild and charging per ride, staying aloft is proving harder than it first appeared. “Growing from $50 million to something like $2 billion in eight months has never happened before, and is probably not supposed to happen,” said Bradley Tusk, an early Bird investor and former Uber advisor known for helping the ride-hailing firm navigate its early political battles. “If this was a normal start-up that was 2 years old, yeah, of course they haven’t figured everything out yet — this is not the point in the cycle where you’d sweat it,” Tusk said. “But a normal start-up also wouldn’t be looking at a $2-billion valuation.” The first ill omens came in January, when the company quietly raised another $300 million at the same $2-billion valuation. In an industry that prizes a perpetual uptick in valuation to propel a narrative of constant growth, a flat round spells trouble, and often a desperate need for cash. Around the same time, the company deleted all mention from its website of its commitment to give cities a dollar per scooter per day to maintain infrastructure and build more bike lanes (though many of the deals it reached with individual cities contain fees). In March, Bird laid off 5% of its workforce, which had grown to more than 700. And the company’s official strategy began to shift. In the whirlwind summer days of 2018, Bird had adhered to the start-up mantra: Grow at all costs. But as 2019 arrived, Bird Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden (a Lyft and Uber alumnus) started to sing a different tune. “2018 was about scaling,” he said at a Malibu tech conference in January. “2019 is about really focusing on the unit economics of the business.” By unit economics, VanderZanden meant the simple math of making money on each scooter dropped into the world. And while trying to make money might seem like a basic imperative for any business, it goes counter to the preferred pattern for 18-month-old start-ups flush with venture capital cash. Many venture-backed businesses operate on the idea that new companies should spend their first years focused on increasing market share at the expense of actually making money — once everyone in the world uses their product, the thinking goes, they can achieve economies of scale, come up with innovations that smaller companies couldn’t pull off, or simply reap the benefits of being a monopoly. This strategy, termed “Blitzscaling” in a popular business book written by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, paid off for world-eating firms such as Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, and has been the animating principle behind Uber and Lyft, which have been locked in a deeply unprofitable race for maximal market share from Day One. “There are very few unique companies for which you can build global scale really quickly and build a dominant market position before other people do, and for those rarefied companies scaling quickly matters more than short-term profits,” said Mark Suster, an early Bird investor and general partner at the Santa Monica fund Upfront Ventures. “This is one of those rarefied companies and markets.” But most start-ups that follow the hypergrowth model are built on software (and in the case of such companies as Uber and Lyft, creative applications of labor law). Bird and its competitors, including Lime, Spin, Uber and Lyft, are in the much less forgiving business of managing a fleet of breakable, stealable scooters. “It’s not that there isn’t a viable business model for these companies,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, an investor who’s worked at Uber, advised Bird competitor Skip and is building a company that would allow scooters to slowly drive themselves to meet users or dock at charging stations. “It’s just not the Uber business model — that’s what Bird and Lime were raising against, and that’s where there probably will be a correction.” VanderZanden acknowledged in January that the company was far from solving its fundamental economic problem. The tens of thousands of scooters Bird had spread across the world — a mix of retail models made by Ninebot (the parent company of Segway) and Xiaomi — broke down (or were stolen or vandalized) long before they could earn back their cost. “Those things were fragile,” he said. “Clearly the unit economics didn’t work on those scooters, but that was a test anyway.” The company is pinning its hopes on the Bird Zero, a custom scooter with longer battery life and sturdier construction. Bird declined to share details on unit economics with The Times for this article, but VanderZanden told tech website the Verge in March that the scooters would need to stay active for six months — around 180 days — for the company to just break even on the purchase price, once charging, repair and permit costs were factored in. But based on a Times review of data used in Bird’s smartphone application, even the supposedly new and improved models are falling short. Nearly 7,000 scooters appeared to be active in Los Angeles County in January, having logged a ride in the previous two weeks. By April, more than 5,500 of those same scooters appeared to be removed from active duty, with no rides logged for the prior two weeks. And the average life of those inactive scooters, based on the time elapsed between their first logged ride and their last before going dark, was 126 days. The apparent life span varied between models. The Xiaomi m365 — the consumer model with which Bird first launched — averaged 124 days on the street. The two Segway models, the ESB and ESX, diverged in their reliability: The simpler ESB averaged 155 days, while the ESX, ostensibly more advanced with a longer battery life and easier-to-service parts, lasted only 82 days on average. Bird Zeros averaged only 116 days. These life spans are far higher than those reported in Louisville, Ky., according to a Quartz analysis of detailed ride data that the city published as part of a transparency program. The 129 scooters (all retail models) that were initially deployed there lasted just 29 days, on average. Bird disputed the accuracy of these life span estimates. Suster, who works closely with Bird as an investor, echoed the company’s stance. “I assure you, the negative narrative is not correct,” he said. He said retail scooters — the Xiaomi and Ninebot models — had a life span of three to four months. But “Bird Zero’s already getting eight to 12,” he said, adding that a next-generation model with better life span, ride experience and ease of repair was already in the pipeline for late 2019. Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism. In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride. The company also raised prices on its core dockless product in cities across America. Riders once paid a dollar to unlock a scooter, and then a flat rate of 15 cents per minute of riding. Now, per-minute fees have increased to 25 cents in Los Angeles and Austin, 29 cents in Baltimore, and 33 cents in Detroit and Charlotte. In other cities such as Bloomington, Ind., and Charlottesville, Va., rates went down to 10 cents per minute. And since last year, the company has been promoting Bird Platform, which sells scooters and technical services to local operators around the world in exchange for a 20% cut of their revenue. Experimentation is the norm at start-ups, especially young ones. But moves that prioritize balance sheets over growth are more common in firms short on cash or those looking for an exit, either through acquisition or an initial public offering. Bird’s competitors face the same challenges. Lime — Bird’s biggest competitor with more than $700 million raised — continues to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, though it is not permitted to operate in its hometown of San Francisco. Skip, which shares exclusive rights to the San Francisco market with Scoot, pulled in $100 million in debt financing in December. Spin, which Ford bought for close to $100 million in November, is unique in using only in-house chargers and mechanics. Uber and Lyft, which have valuations and cash flows from their core ride-hailing businesses that dwarf those of scooter-only companies, both have scooter operations as well (Uber operates Jump). Investors and mobility experts remain optimistic that Bird — or at least some form of a mass scooter business — will land on a viable strategy before the cash flow dries up. Many cited a section of Uber’s recent regulatory filings, which predicted that a majority of trips under three miles will happen on electric scooters as opposed to cars in the near future. “It’s a complicated business with lots of issues to resolve, from unit economics to regulatory to marketing,” Tusk said. “But the market is so big, and there’s so much opportunity as the world trends towards congested urbanization, that the thesis holds for a while.” Others pointed to a possible soft landing for scooters as a component of city transit services along the lines of existing bike-share programs. Juan Matute, deputy director of UCLA’s Institute of Transportation Studies, said that public-private partnerships could spark more investment in charging stations, which would reduce costs and compel law enforcement to pay more attention to theft and vandalism. “The unit economics might work out as a result of all this VC investment,” Matute said. “And then some of the less sexy smaller providers that have been involved in the bike-share space can start offering some of these types of vehicles as a city-contracted managed provider.” Scooter companies are betting that more durable two-wheelers will lead to profitability, though questions about brand loyalty remain. Suster says Bird’s head start on the competition has given it operations expertise and a wealth of rider data that constitute a “moat” — a defense against any competitors trying to steal its business. “It looks so easy — you just put these scooters out and have revenue,” Suster said. “But it’s a complex asset management business, like owning airplanes or trains — our ability to maintain these scooters at cost, repair them quickly, and have them back out in the street at scale means our advantage is much greater than any new entrant.”",https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html
How Bird plans to blanket the world with electric scooters without going bankrupt,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,5,7,"How Bird plans to blanket the world with electric scooters without going bankrupt. Bird is outsourcing the scooter-sharing business to aspiring entrepreneurs in countries outside the US and Europe. Operating an electric scooter-sharing service is expensive and hard. The scooters break down, or they get vandalized or impounded by local law enforcement. Scaling that business globally, like Bird and Lime are trying to do, is even harder. Every scooter company today is operating at a loss, but Bird in particular has an interesting plan to spread the gospel of the scooter without going completely bankrupt. It involves selling e-scooters to local entrepreneurs, providing them with advice and technical support to get started, letting them incur all the costs associated with maintenance and operations, and then taking a small percentage of each scooter trip. It’s called “Bird Platform,” which the company originally unveiled last November. But what the Santa Monica-based startup didn’t say at the time was that Bird Platform would be targeted at aspiring scooter entrepreneurs who live in countries outside the US and Europe, where Bird operates its own branded scooter-sharing service. In this way Bird can inspire the creation of new scooter companies that won’t directly compete with its own service, as well as orchestrate the spread of e-scooters in cities around the world, without losing more money than it already is. “It came out of a brainstorm around how do we take the mission to the world,” Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden told The Verge. “And so, we’re excited about that. We’re also excited because it... allows us to grow faster.” Bird is planning to rollout Bird Platform in three initial markets: New Zealand, Canada, and Latin America. Local entrepreneurs can buy Bird’s e-scooters at cost, as well as access the company’s tools, products, and technology needed to manage a fleet of shared e-scooters. Bird will even fly in its own operations experts to help launch the business. And in exchange, the company will take 20 percent of each trip fare. Bird typically charges $1 to unlock a scooter, and then 15 cents per minute of riding. The average trip generates around $3.75 in revenue for the company — though assumedly Bird Platform users would set their own prices. The scooters, which are manufactured by Bird’s partners in China, will come preinstalled with all the firmware and GPS technology, called the “Bird Brain,” that allows them to be deployed as part of a shared fleet. “It’s capital intensive,” VanderZanden said. “What we’ve really tried to do is keep the upfront costs as low as possible.” In some ways, what Bird is proposing with Bird Platform is very similar to the business model of VanderZanden’s former employer, Uber. That company is famous for being asset-light: independent Uber drivers own their cars, pay for their own gas, and cover most insurance costs. Uber builds the app that connects riders with drivers, and then takes a percentage (around 30-35 percent) of each fare. “In some ways it’s similar [to Uber],” VanderZanden said. “But in some ways, it’s different, just because it’s more operationally intensive.” It’s an interesting move by Bird, especially considering how wildly unsustainable the scooter-sharing business is turning out to be. Recently, Quartz’s Alison Griswold crunched the numbers from Louisville, Kentucky, and found that the median scooter took 70 trips over 85 miles, and had a lifespan of 23 days. Lifespan is a big deal for scooter companies: the longer the scooters can stay in operation, the more money they can make for the company. And right now, these scooters aren’t living long enough to earn a profit. VanderZanden has been staving off the winter doldrums (colder weather, fewer scooter trips) by mulling over the unit economics conundrum. Most of the solution rests in the company’s ability to roll out its new, longer-lasting, more rugged scooter, the Bird Zero. He wouldn’t say what percentage of Bird’s fleet is now comprised of the more rugged scooter. But he did say that in order for Bird to eventually break even, the scooters will need to increase their lifespan to six months. “We’ve been hard at work on future hardware as well, with even bigger batteries and more ruggedized [scooters], which will circle back on at some point in the future,” he said. “We’re looking at every technology you could imagine. If it makes sense from an economic standpoint, and ideally improves the rider experience, then it’s a no-brainer.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18253522/bird-platform-scooter-new-zealand-canada-latin-america
Disability rights group alarmed by Portland e-scooter rules,AP,,National,2019,5,9,"Disability rights group alarmed by Portland e-scooter rules. A disability rights nonprofit group in Oregon filed a letter of complaint Thursday with the city of Portland over new rules about an electric scooter pilot program. In its letter, Disability Rights Oregon said Portland’s decision to have residents file complaints about the ubiquitous e-scooters directly with the companies participating in the program instead of with the city reduces transparency and increases danger to the public. Portland just began a second, yearlong phase of the pilot program intended to help the progressive city introduce the devices while avoiding pitfalls experienced by some other major U.S. metropolises. It allows up to 2,500 of the devices on city streets from multiple companies as part of the “micro-mobility revolution” that’s swept through major U.S. cities. A four-month experiment with the e-scooters last year was successful but also generated 6,000 complaints and raised questions about pedestrian safety and the impact of the devices on public spaces like parks. The scooters also led to 176 visits to the emergency room or urgent care, the city said. Electric scooters have surged in popularity in cities across the U.S. as a convenient, environmentally friendly mode of transportation for short trips that can otherwise be clogged with traffic. A report released last month by the National Association of City Transportation Officials said riders took 38.5 million trips on shared electric scooters in 2018, eclipsing the 36.5 million trips on shared, docked bicycles. Last year, Portland residents could file complaints with the city about scooters. Now, the companies themselves are required to maintain complaint lines 24/7 and must report data to the city each month. The information is reported with names and details stripped out, said Emily Cooper, the nonprofit’s legal director, and companies have an incentive to downplay any serious issues. “If someone was hurt or someone needs help, there’s no way for the city to know that based on the way they structured this agreement,” she said. “The city shouldn’t look at safety at arm’s length.” Dylan Rivera, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Transportation, did not immediately return a request for comment. Brianna Orr, a transportation specialist with the city, said in an email to Disability Rights Oregon that the city wasn’t able to respond quickly enough to complaints in the first phase of the pilot program. Now, for example, participating companies must respond to abandoned scooters blocking sidewalks and curb ramps within 60 minutes, she said. The city will audit response times of the companies and the monthly reports will be public record, Orr said in the email, which was shared with the AP by the nonprofit. In famously progressive Portland, e-scooters are an important part of the city’s drive to reduce traffic and encourage alternative modes of transportation, from light rail to bike commuting. But like Portland, cities across the U.S. have struggled to accommodate the devices while regulating safety and access for people in lower income neighborhoods. San Francisco, for instance, kicked out Bird, Lime and Spin and instituted a competition for permits, ultimately awarding them to relative underdogs Scoot and Skip and capping the number of scooters that could be deployed. New York City does not allow shared electric scooters, although legislation has been introduce to change the rule.",https://apnews.com/2988bb59c9aa4fea8191a7f42269c9f6
Could Data Analytics Force Electric Scooters To Obey Traffic Laws?,Forbes,,National,2019,5,11,"Could Data Analytics Force Electric Scooters To Obey Traffic Laws? As I was nearly knocked down by an electric scooter zipping by on the sidewalk for the hundredth time this month and moments later watched a scooter almost cause an accident as it sailed the wrong way down the center line of a one-way street and straight through a red light, I began to wonder why, in a world in which our phones today offer pinpoint navigation, the scooter industry cannot manage to force its users to obey traffic laws. Would it be feasible to force the electric ride sharing scooters that are increasingly deluging our cities to integrate technological safeguards to prevent at least their most egregious traffic violations? The speed and suddenness with which rentable electric scooters have taken over the streets of major cities across the United States is nothing short of astounding. From seeing a scooter once every few weeks to this very afternoon having 16 strewn on the sidewalks within one block of my apartment building, it cannot be understated how deeply the scooter revolution has penetrated the world of urban mobility. While there have always been bicyclists and scooter enthusiasts that have flouted safety laws, the rise of electric scooters everywhere that are rentable by the minute is leading to a shift in how we see safety laws. It is rare to see a bicyclist, even a tourist on a short term rentable bike, barreling through pedestrians on a crowded sidewalk. It is unfortunately commonplace, at least in my area of Washington, DC, to see scooters doing so. In fact, said scooter might even have two or three people on it, causing the machine to lurch wildly from side to side, clipping pedestrians as it whips past. Worse, their motorized nature means the traditional social cues of pedaling slower when approaching a pedestrian from behind are absent, so they often zip by at top speed. The lack of clear universal identifiers like vehicle license plates also makes it difficult for pedestrians who are sideswiped or otherwise have dangerous interactions with scooters to be able to provide authorities with the offender’s identity. Making matters worse, the same police forces that routinely stop bicyclists who violate traffic laws appear to be far more reluctant to intervene when it comes to scooters committing those same violations. The leave-anywhere nature of scooters also create unique hazards for those with mobility impairments. A visually impaired resident of my neighborhood commented recently that his daily walk to a local bus stop has become a nightmare of scooters strewn haphazardly in his path, while another resident that uses a motorized wheelchair now often requires a friend to travel with him to clear any scooters out of his path that have been abandoned in the middle of the sidewalk. We live in a world where the navigation sensors on our smartphones are precise enough to pinpoint how many feet away we are from the entrance to our destination, which side of the hallway we are walking in the mall and to distinguish whether we are on the sidewalk or the roadway in many areas. Why have electronic scooters not made at least cursory attempts to integrate such technologies? It would be fairly trivial to flag that a scooter is driving down the center of a two-lane road going the wrong way down a one-way road. Integrating standard commercial traffic information could confirm that the surrounding vehicles are all moving in the opposite direction as the scooter (verifying that this is not a temporary construction or accident detour). While the precise boundaries of sidewalks and roadways can be difficult to distinguish with consumer mobile GPS navigation, the integration of additional sensors, including camera systems, could go a long way towards reducing illegal and unsafe operation of electric scooters on crowded sidewalks. Such sensors could also be used to detect scooters left in the middle of sidewalks, sounding an audible alert or summoning company staff to relocate them. The addition of ultrasonic obstacle sensors similar to those used in vehicle parking assistance systems would also allow scooters to automatically throttle their speed when they detect obstacles such as pedestrians ahead. All of this data could be used by scooter companies to identify users operating their scooters in unsafe ways or parking them in unsafe ways. Infractions could result in warnings, fines and suspension or even permanent bans from their services. Of course, adding sensors or using telemetry data to evaluate rider safety and compliance with traffic laws would add additional expense that companies currently have no incentive to bear. What would happen if cities began passing laws that required basic safety telemetry and sensor systems be installed on all motorized commercial rentable conveyances, with daily reports provided to the city's public safety authorities? At the very least, users committing the most egregious of violations could be removed from the system. Moreover, by creating greater visibility into the areas with the greatest number of violations, police can more precisely target enforcement action. Putting this all together, we have the technology and data analytics today to make motorized rentable vehicles like electric scooters vastly safer than they are, but like all things Silicon Valley, the law has yet to keep pace and create the necessary incentives for companies to embrace these safety features. Until they do, we’ll just have to get used to sharing our sidewalks with an ever-growing army of irresponsible motorized drivers and a dynamic obstacle course of strewn scooters.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/05/11/could-data-analytics-force-electric-scooters-to-obey-traffic-laws/
Apple Pay will let you rent a Bird scooter without downloading the app,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,5,13,"Apple Pay will let you rent a Bird scooter without downloading the app. Tap your phone, and start the ride. Apple and Bird are working together to make the process of renting a dockless electric scooter even easier. Soon, anyone with an iPhone can use Apple Pay’s NFC tag to unlock and rent a Bird scooter, completely bypassing the e-scooter company’s app. The news was first mentioned by Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president for internet services, in her keynote at the 2019 Transact conference in Las Vegas, which is geared toward people in the payment industry. In addition to Bird, Bailey also said that Apple was working with a parking meter payment company called PayByRide and Walmart’s e-commerce subsidiary Bonobos. Finding and renting a Bird scooter today isn’t particularly difficult, so the fact that Apple and Bird see this as an opportunity to make a relatively frictionless experience even more frictionless (frictionless-ier?) is interesting. Right now, you download the Bird app, find the closest scooter on the map, scan the QR code, and away you go. This new function would eliminate all of those steps and allow you to just tap your phone against the e-scooter to initiate the transaction and start your ride. There are a few requirements: you need to have Apple Pay and a phone with an NFC chip (iPhone 7, 8, or X), you must be 18 years old or older, and you’ll need to agree to Bird’s terms of service. Tapping the phone against the scooter will automatically open Bird’s website on your phone where you can do all that. For Apple, this is a way to broaden the use cases of Apple Pay to functions that would typically take place within a smartphone app. At the Transact conference, Bailey said Apple was looking to break down barriers by introducing shortcuts using NFC tags, according to PaymentsSource. For Bird, it’s about getting as many people on its scooters as possible — including first-time riders who have yet to download the app. “Similar to checking out at a grocery store that is Apple Pay-enabled, individuals, whether they have the Bird app downloaded, will now be able to utilize Apple Pay’s NFC feature to easily begin a Bird ride,” said a source close to the matter. “This global feature will enable people to have seamless access to a sustainable mobility option, while knowing that their information is secure with Apple Pay.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18618336/apple-pay-bird-electric-scooter-rent-nfc-tag
E-scooter company Spin will place dozens of start-up’s solar-powered docking stations in two cities this summer,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,5,22,"The stations are being billed as a way to reduce sidewalk clutter and attract business. Electric scooters have posed a problem outside many storefronts and heavily trafficked buildings since they began appearing in dozens of cities across the country last year. Unevenly parked and prone to tipping over, the devices clutter entrances, turn off potential customers and give off a general whiff of unnecessary chaos. Now two U.S. cities, Washington and Ann Arbor, Mich., will be the setting for a 60-day pilot program that is being billed as a way to bring order to that chaos. The evolving plan — being launched by the electric scooter company Spin and a California start-up called Swiftmile — involves installing dozens of electric docking stations on private property as a way to charge e-scooters, give riders a designated place to park their devices and draw more foot traffic to particular locations. Benjamin Fong, Spin’s director of business development, said 40 docking stations built by Swiftmile will be placed in Washington over the summer and 10 will be placed in Ann Arbor. For now, he said, the solar-powered stations will be compatible only with scooters from Spin, a San Francisco-based scooter-sharing company focused on the “last mile” transportation market. Ann Arbor has about 200 Spin scooters on its streets and Washington has about 650, Fong said. “We’re looking at partnering with all sorts of private property owners, including apartment buildings, office buildings, retail locations, restaurants and universities,” Fong said. “The value is that this is a way of driving traffic to these locations, and it’s an amenity for building residents and employees because it will help people get around.” “It’s also a win for cities because it helps reduce the clutter of scooters on the street, and it’s a win for customers because it helps them find a scooter,” he added. The dangers associated with riding electric scooters in crowded urban areas are obvious. But within months of the scooters’ appearance in more than 100 cities worldwide, public officials, doctors and ­scooter company employees were also warning of the dangers the devices pose to pedestrians. In January, Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, told The Washington Post that the devices are nightmares for the visually impaired and those who get around via wheelchair. While able-bodied people can usually maneuver around ­e-scooters left on the sidewalk, the elderly and disabled can have a much harder time, he said. Colin Roche, Swiftmile’s co-founder, said his charging stations — which can accommodate any brand of e-scooter — are ideal for the kind of pedestrian-congested areas where the devices are often discarded, such as bus and subway stations. “Last year was the crazy rollout, which was very polarizing,” Roche said. “Some people loved them and some people hated them, but the problems that made people hate them are actually fixable."" “We create order out of the chaos,” he added. Roche said Swiftmile’s charging stations take about three hours to juice a scooter with a completely uncharged battery but require much less time when a device is moderately charged. Once a parked scooter hits a designated battery level, the device will reappear on riders’ apps, he said. “These are solar-powered stations, and that means they will be 100 percent renewable power transportation,” Roche added. Spin has scooters in 32 U.S. cities and campuses — including Washington, Denver, Detroit, Charlotte and Coral Gables, Fla. The devices — which cost $1 to rent and 15 cents per minute to operate — are also available to students on campus at University of Michigan, as well as at Oklahoma State University and a few others. Last year, Ford Motor announced that it had purchased Spin. The $100 million purchase means Ford joins companies such as Alphabet, Uber and Lyft — all of which have poured millions into the upstart e-scooter revolution. “We think scooters are genuinely wonderful solutions, but they’re not the solution for everything,” said Dan Winston, a general manager overseeing Spin’s Washington-area operations. “They’re part of a strong transportation network and can fill gaps and complement other modes of getting around.” “The Swiftmile partnership is going to increase clarity about parking, and our team can work with them to figure out best practices for serving these stations,” he added.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/21/e-scooter-startup-spin-will-place-dozens-solar-powered-docking-stations-two-cities-this-summer/
Electric Scooters Are Sweeping the Country. New York Says Not So Fast.,New York Times,,National,2019,5,29,"Electric Scooters Are Sweeping the Country. New York Says Not So Fast. Lawmakers worry that scooters are too dangerous, especially in Manhattan, where cars, pedestrians and cyclists already compete for limited street space. When Helmis Ortega visited Atlanta not long ago, he toured the city on an electric scooter. Once back in New York City, he was struck by the scooter-free streets. “It blew my mind,” said Mr. Ortega, a paralegal who lives in Upper Manhattan. “How do we not have this here?” The answer is simple: Officials do not believe the biggest — and most crowded — city in the country is ready for scooters. Companies like Bird and Lime that rent scooters in other cities have stayed away from New York because the devices are technically illegal. Rule breakers could get hit with a $500 fine or have their scooter confiscated. So New Yorkers, long proud of their status as cultural trendsetters on everything from fashion to Cronuts, have been left out of the scooter craze sweeping the nation. Electric scooters have appeared in dozens of cities — from Los Angeles to Washington and across the Midwest — winning plenty of fans and at least as many enemies who view them as a nuisance. They are a cheap way to get around, for fun or commuting, and are faster than walking and more enjoyable than sitting in traffic. The devices recently became legal in New Jersey, where they have already flooded the streets of Hoboken, just across the Hudson River. But it appears that electric scooters are unlikely to arrive in New York City anytime soon. Leaders in New York are reluctant to change the law and worry that scooters are too dangerous, especially in an increasingly congested Manhattan where cars, pedestrians and cyclists are already competing for limited street space. An unfortunate spill by Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, in Mexico City did not help the cause. He rented a Lime scooter on vacation in April and immediately “face planted,” leaving him covered with black grime from the street and nursing a few scrapes. Editors’ Picks A Columnist Makes Sense of Wall Street Like None Other (See Footnote) My Best Friend Is Gone, and Nothing Feels Right Mariah Carey, Elusive No More Mr. Johnson said in an interview that scooters are “absolutely fun,” but they were better suited for a quiet suburb. “We're New York, and I have real concerns about people getting injured,” he said. For scooters to hit the streets of New York, the State Legislature and the City Council would probably have to approve new rules — a difficult task when leaders are already quarreling over other thorny issues like marijuana legalization and rent regulation. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is known to work out on a stationary bike at the gym, has scoffed at the idea of riding a scooter. “I just don’t like the idea personally, because I’m like, ‘If you’re going to move around why are you not getting some exercise?’” the mayor told reporters last fall. “It seems really passive to me.” His lack of enthusiasm has not stopped rental companies from lobbying local leaders. The companies have spent at least $475,000 on lobbying for electric scooters and bikes at the state and city level during the first four months of this year, according to state records. Bird and Jump Bikes, an Uber subsidiary, each spent at least $100,000 on lobbying. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fan of muscle cars and motorcycles, wanted to legalize scooters at the state level as part of budget negotiations earlier this year, but state lawmakers were not on board. Still, supporters are not giving up. Jessica Ramos, a Democratic state senator from Queens, introduced state legislation to allow scooters, with a public hearing scheduled for June 7. “We’re trying to have this conversation precisely because we’re behind so many other big cities across the world, not just in this country,” Ms. Ramos said in an interview. “We want to be able to offer residents environmentally friendly ways to get around.” Although the devices are banned, some people own private scooters and flout the rules. Sarah M. Kaufman, an urban planning professor at New York University, said she often sees electric scooters in Manhattan. She has used a Bird scooter, which the company gave her to try out, without getting in trouble. “I’ve ridden it past police and they haven’t said anything,” she said. “It doesn’t seem to be something that’s being enforced.” Still, city officials are concerned that an influx of scooters could lead to serious crashes. Two people died in the city last year while riding electric scooters, including a 7-year-old boy who was hit by a public bus last May. The boy, Shevon Bethea, was riding a children’s electric Razor scooter, known as the E300 model, which can cost more than $250, according to city officials. A bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority hit the boy in the Bronx, the police said. Broken pieces of the boy’s blue scooter were scattered across the street. The driver has not been charged. Safety concerns have been an issue in other places. A recent study of scooter accidents in Austin, Tex., found that nearly half of the 190 riders injured there had suffered head injuries. Less than 1 percent of riders were wearing a helmet when they were injured and nearly a third had been drinking alcohol, according to the report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local officials. The authors recommended that the city educate riders about helmets and safe speeds. Officials in New York reviewed that study and have taken a cautious approach to what some have called a ""micro-mobility revolution"" — the arrival not just of electric scooters, but also dockless electric bikes and other devices. The city does allow some electric bikes, known as pedal-assist bicycles, which require a rider to pedal to activate an electric motor. But Citi Bike, the bike-share program, had to pull all 1,000 of its electric bikes off the city streets in April because of safety concerns about the brakes. Bikes favored by delivery workers — throttle-controlled electric bikes, which can travel faster than 20 miles per hour — are illegal, a decision that has raised concerns over discrimination against a largely immigrant work force. Ms. Ramos’s bill would also allow local governments to set rules for delivery bikes. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who is running for president, has taken a harsh stance against delivery bikes, though Mr. Johnson, the City Council speaker, supports making them legal. Uber and Lyft, the titans of ride-hailing, are also competing to offer electric scooters and bikes across the country. Lyft bought Citi Bike last year while Uber bought Jump Bikes. “We look forward to giving all New Yorkers more access to green, car-free transportation like scooters and bikes on our platform,” said Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber. “Most importantly, we recognize it’s past time the state address e-bikes, which are critical for delivery workers.” Bird, which offers scooters in more than 100 cities around the world, said it hoped lawmakers in New York would act soon. “As an otherwise forward-thinking global leader, New York is behind on this issue and needs to catch up,” said Paul Steely White, the former leader of Transportation Alternatives, a safety advocacy group, who now works for Bird. Mr. Johnson, a Democrat who is expected to run for mayor in 2021, said that if state lawmakers legalized scooters, he would be open to the idea of a pilot program outside Manhattan. “Maybe we could find certain neighborhoods where we could pilot this — maybe out in the Rockaways and see what it’s like on the boardwalk,” he said. But Liz Krueger, a powerful Democratic state senator from Manhattan, said legalizing scooters did not have enough support in the current state legislative session, which ends on June 19. A 10-year-old boy on a scooter almost slammed into her recently, she said, reinforcing her opposition. “I don’t think there’s any place for them on the streets of Manhattan,” she said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/nyregion/electric-scooters-new-york.html
Bird just bought its way into San Francisco by purchasing scooter rival Scoot,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,6,12,"Bird just bought its way into San Francisco by purchasing scooter rival Scoot. Two scooter companies team up to take over the city. Last August, San Francisco welcomed some electric scooters back into its midst, but it gave Bird (and Lime and Spin) the finger — making the city an afterthought in the scooter wars. But now, Bird has bought its way back into the city by purchasing Scoot, one of the two scooter companies that did get permits to operate in SF.So the city’s last-mile mobility race may be ramping up again.A press release announcing the acquisition is calling it “a strategic decision from two like-minded companies,” and says that Scoot will continue to operate under its own brand as a subsidiary of Bird, presumably because it needs to in order to operate in places like San Francisco. Scoot also provides larger Vespa-sized scooters — clearly an area of interest for Bird since it announced its electric moped earlier this month.But intriguingly, Scoot riders won’t just be using Scoot’s scooters anymore, but rather ones from Bird. “Over the coming months, you will be able to find awesome Bird-built Scoots in the cities where you already scoot, and many more cities to follow. Scoot riders can expect the same great service, but now with more, better vehicles,” reads part of an email sent to Scoot users today. “We are thrilled to welcome Scoot to the Bird ecosystem and look forward to working with the Scoot team as we further scale our complementary missions – to replace car trips with micro-mobility options for all,” said Travis VanderZanden, founder and CEO of Bird.Bird previously tried to get around the SF ban on its scooters by offering a $25 monthly rental service, where it would deliver the scooters instead of leaving them lying around the city. It’s also trying to sell e-scooters to entrepreneurs around the world instead of operating services everywhere all by itself.Ford purchased Spin, one of the other startups that was excluded from San Francisco, for $100 million last November. Uber just revealed a new scooter today for its previously purchased subsidiary Jump, and Lyft rolled out its own shared electric scooters in Denver last September.Update, 5:09PM ET: Added that Scoot users may be riding Bird-built scooters in the near future.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663047/bird-electric-scooters-scoot-san-francisco
"Increasing Electric Scooter Injuries Are a Cause for Concern, Study Shows",Observer,,National,2019,6,13,"Increasing Electric Scooter Injuries Are a Cause for Concern, Study Shows. The electric scooter phenomenon has naturally resulted in a spike of injuries. According to a new study by Rutgers University, facial and head injuries from riding electric scooters “have tripled over the past decade.” The findings are not surprising, considering the explosive popularity of shared scooter startups like Bird and Lime, which have rapidly expanded into international cities in the past couple of years. The study, published in The American Journal of Otolaryngology, found that “From 2008 to 2017, there were 990 recorded events for craniofacial injuries secondary to motorized scooters extrapolating to an estimated 32,001 emergency department (ED) visits.” The majority (62.1 percent) of patients injured while riding electric scooters were male, with most of them being children between the ages of six and 12 years old. While the sheer numbers of motorized scooters on the road today could be blamed for the increased injuries, the study found that the cause is actually due to adult riders foregoing wearing the “appropriate protective equipment.” According to the study, when helmet use was recorded, 66 percent of patients were not wearing one. Despite strong recommendations for protective helmets, most dock-less e-scooter rides lend themselves to a lack of rider protection. This is especially true considering the “slow” limited 15 miles per hour that these scooters are designed to go up to. The study’s release coincides with Uber revealing the latest iteration of its Jump e-scooter—the electric bike rental startup it acquired in 2018—at this week’s Uber Elevate conference. The latest Jump scooter boasts a new braking system, which makes it easier to slow down, in turn helping to improve safety measures for riders. Electric scooter safety has been under scrutiny since app-powered rental startups came on the scene, prompting many cities to ban them altogether. Major cities like New York and Austin have managed to keep these companies from invading their streets by quickly drafting local laws banning the two-wheeled electric vehicles. As more scooter fleets flood cities around the world, the Rutgers study’s goal is to showcase the need for stricter electric scooter use policies and public safety awareness to prevent increasing injuries.",https://observer.com/2019/06/electric-scooter-injuries-study/
New York is poised to legalize electric scooters and bikes,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,6,17,"New York is poised to legalize electric scooters and bikes. A longtime holdout is finally ready to welcome the popular and polarizing battery-powered devices. New York, a longtime holdout in the dockless electric scooter boom, appears poised to finally allow scooter-sharing companies like Bird and Lime to operate on its roads. Lawmakers in the state capital of Albany have reached a deal to lift the ban on throttle-based scooters and bikes, and if Governor Andrew Cuomo signs off, New Yorkers may soon see the electric-powered vehicles zipping down their streets in droves. The bill would change state law to legalize e-bikes and scooters, but would require cities to opt in and would give localities the opportunity to decide for themselves how to regulate the vehicles. Under the new law, e-bikes and scooters would be legal statewide, but a sharing service would need to be permitted by municipalities before launching. The only exception is that the borough of Manhattan won’t have a permitted e-scooter program for the time being. This would appear to satisfy some lawmakers who opposed legalizing scooters for reasons of safety and sidewalk obstruction. The measure is part of a last-ditch effort by lawmakers to pass numerous bills before the legislative session ends on Wednesday. If it passes, it would then go to Governor Cuomo’s desk to be signed into law. Cuomo supports legalizing e-scooters and bikes, but a spokesperson said the governor is still reviewing the latest proposal. Even New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has criticized e-bikes as dangerous and ordered the New York Police Department to crack down on food delivery workers who use them, appears to be in support. “We appreciate this commonsense legislation that clarifies the rules around e-bikes on our streets,” a spokesperson for de Blasio told The Verge. “Safety for everyone on our roads is our priority, and we look forward to working with legislators and communities as we develop plans to implement the new law.” New York has remained a scooter-free zone despite the phenomenon’s rapid growth around the globe. As other cities grappled with how to regulate and manage the sudden appearance of hundreds (or thousands) of scooters on their streets, New Yorkers have been blissfully unaware of the joys and pitfalls of playing host to the two-wheeled devices. But that’s about to change. On one hand, New York City could be a natural fit for these scooter companies, which have been valued at as high as $2 billion. New York is a city with a booming public transit system that millions take every day, but it’s also filled with gaps. A recent report showed that 24 percent of the city’s subway stations — many located in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens — were inaccessible to many of the city’s residents. Meanwhile, food delivery workers have borne the brunt of the city’s enforcement of the ban. While pedal-assisted e-bikes are legal to ride in New York City, throttle-powered vehicles favored by the delivery workers are not, and delivery workers, most of them immigrants, routinely face fines of $500 and having their bikes confiscated by the NYPD. The shift won’t come over night. The city still needs to work out its own rules for the scooter companies, which will likely include a pilot program and permitting process similar to San Francisco’s and Chicago’s. And it’s unclear how the city will approach delivery workers who have been fined and had their bikes confiscated under the current rules. But that hasn’t stopped the scooter startups from declaring victory. “We are just one step away from better transportation options for New Yorkers,” said Phil Jones, who runs government relations for Lime, “and there is momentum to cross the finish line.” Bird, which has been lobbying New York officials for over a year now, predicted that its scooter sharing service won’t launch in New York until spring 2020. “The weight of this moment cannot be overstated,” said Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy at Bird. “New York is on the cusp of making its streets safer and more equitable for everyone — all our legislators have to do is vote yes.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18682056/ny-electric-bike-scooter-bill-legalize
Nashville is banning electric scooters after a man was killed,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,6,21,"Nashville is banning electric scooters after a man was killed. The mayor will only allow them to return with ‘strict oversight for numbers, safety, and accessibility’. Nashville is banishing the scooters after its first scooter-related death. The city’s mayor David Briley notified seven scooter companies operating in Nashville he was ending the pilot project and banning electric scooters from the streets, according to a letter he posted to Twitter Friday. “We have seen the public safety and accessibility costs that these devices inflict, and it is not fair to our residents for this to continue,” Briley writes. “If these devices return in the future, it will be after a public process, on our terms, with strict oversight for numbers, safety, and accessibility.” Briley had considered banning the scooters a month ago, according to the Tennessean. But it wasn’t until Nashville experienced its first scooter-related death that the mayor formally announced his plan to remove scooters from the city. Brady Gaulke, 26, was struck by a vehicle and killed while riding a scooter in May. Police found that Gaulke had more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system and was responsible for the crash. Nashville has been a hotbed for scooter sharing, with seven companies and as many as 4,000 scooters on the streets. Briley, in consultation with the Nashville city council, plans to allow one or two companies to eventually return and put smaller fleets of scooters back on the streets. Companies would compete for the limited slots through a process overseen by the city’s Transportation Licensing Commission, according to the Tennessean. Since they emerged in late 2017, dockless electric scooters have flummoxed city officials. Cities have tried to juggle the popularity of the devices with the need to better regulate their numbers while also forcing the companies to apply for permits. Some cities have proposed rules too onerous for the scooter companies, forcing them to decide whether to stick around or pull out. Uber pulled its Jump bikes and scooters from San Antonio, Texas, last week after the city proposed changes that would cut its fleet in half. Over in Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo is proposing new rules after the June 10th death of an e-scooter rider, who was struck by a truck. One of the last major holdouts, New York State, recently legalized electric scooters, but will allow cities to write their own rules for scooter companies to follow.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18701299/nashville-electric-scooter-ban-man-killed
These Cities Will Track Scooters to Get a Handle on Regulation,Wired,,National,2019,6,25,"These Cities Will Track Scooters to Get a Handle on Regulation. The cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, will use the same tool to keep track of where scooters go and where they are parked. It’s moving day for a controversial data standard that has pitted cities against some private transportation companies, like Uber and Lyft, that want to operate on their streets. On Tuesday, 15 cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco, and Bogota, Colombia, said they’ve created a nonprofit called the Open Mobility Foundation, devoted to collecting, maintaining, and standardizing information about where shared vehicles—including cars, scooters, jet packs, and bicycles—are parked. The foundation will take control of the Mobility Data Specification, a digital tool created by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. LADOT has used the standard to solicit and organize information about shared scooters: where they’re parked, where they’re traveling, and whether they’re broken or charged. Cities can also use the tool to share information with the companies—about, say, special events in the area that might lead to an uptick in demand. For now, the tool has been used only to collect and share information on scooters and bicycles. But the cities who now control it believe the data standard could be used to one day regulate shared cars and even autonomous taxis. At least 50 other global cities, seeking a simple way to keep track of the new and often controversial scooters on their streets, have adopted the Mobility Data Standard too. Many require companies to submit data in that format if they want to operate in the cities—something they can do because scooters, unlike ride-hailing companies, are generally regulated on the municipal level. The cities say the info will help them improve their transportation systems and make them safer and easier to navigate. “We’ve got huge challenges we have to solve, whether it’s around safety, or climate, or public health, or equity,” says Seleta Reynolds, general manager of LADOT. The data also helps cities regulate the transportation companies, letting officials know whether the vehicles are operating in the proper places. In LA, for example, scooter users are banned from many boardwalks; many other cities want to make sure scooters operate as frequently in low-income neighborhoods as in high-income ones. Initially, companies chafed against the data standard, These companies have also argued that intensive government data-collection efforts could harm users, because governments may not be able to safeguard the information. (Privacy advocates have also objected to the tool.) Now that responsibility for the data standard is in the hands of some of the country’s most important transportation officials, handling sensitive data “will be some of the most important initial work of the foundation,” says Reynolds. Not every private company has been invited to work with the cities on this new foundation. Only Spin, a scooter-share operator owned by Ford, and scooter-share unicorn Bird are “founding members” of the Open Mobility Foundation. Reynolds says the city officials who created the foundation did not approach Uber and Lyft, which run bike- and scooter-share businesses and supported local legislation that would restrict what kinds of data cities are allowed to collect. Lyft did not respond to a request for comment, and an Uber spokesperson declined to comment. Moving control of the standard to a foundation doesn’t resolve the messy politics around scooters. But at least for some players who have wrangled seats at the table, it signifies a detente. “We look forward to participating in important discussions” as a member of the foundation, Ariella Steinhorn, a spokesperson for Spin, said in a statement. “We are excited to work together as partners rather than adversaries.”",https://www.wired.com/story/these-cities-will-track-scooters-handle-regulation/
"Oregon deputies pull out 57 electric scooters, bikes out of Portland river",Fox News,Fox,National,2019,6,27,"Oregon deputies pull out 57 electric scooters, bikes out of Portland river. This is not your average ""catch of the day."" A sheriff's office in Oregon recently disclosed it hauled dozens of electric scooters and bicycles out of a major river in Portland. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday on Twitter the department's dive team recovered a total of 57 scooters and bikes over a two-day period in the Willamette River in Portland. ""The team had to quit early because they needed a bigger boat!"" the sheriff's office said. Officials told FOX12 the dive team found 15 scooters in May during a training exercise before dredging up dozens more this week. The scooter brands included Razor, Lime and Bird. The dive team used the scooter recovery as a training exercise since the river bottom has limited visibility so everything has to be found by touch. As scooter popularity has exploded in recent years, so have environmental concerns over the electric batteries impacting marine life. Sgt. Brandon White from the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office told the Oregonian officials weren't who dumped the scooters, but that divers were worried batteries would leak into the river. “We advise those people not to park scooters in the river,” he told the paper. The recovery mission in the river drew a small crowd along the seawall in downtown Portland, seemingly all curious by the police activity. “It kind of sucks to see them being abused like that,” Ryan Alexander told FOX12. Many of the scooters appeared to be rusted, but the sheriff's office said the lights on one were still working. A Lime spokesperson told Fox News vandalizing scooters is ""wrong and only harms those who rely on these vehicles every day as an affordable, convenient way to get around."" ""If anyone sees a Lime scooter that they suspect is being tampered with or vandalized, we ask that they please immediately report it to our 24/7 customer service team, available through the app, email (support@li.me), and phone or text (1-888-LIME-345),"" the spokesperson added.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-deputies-pull-out-57-electric-scooters-bikes-out-of-portland-river

MCSO Sgt. Brandon White told USA TODAY the sheriff's office first noticed the scooters last month and decided to use this month's training days to recover as many as possible. The dive team gets two training days per month, he said. ""Initially, they thought they would get about 30, or 15 a day,"" White said. Both days, the dive team got started at around 8:30 a.m, White said. There was concern from the sheriff's divers the batteries from the scooters could leak into the river, The Oregonian reported. “We advise those people not to park scooters in the river,” White said to the newspaper. The sheriff's office tweeted on Tuesday that divers pulled out five scooters and expected to find 15 more. Wednesday, the total ballooned to 57, including the bikes. ""We’re very proud of our dive team,"" White said. ""They noticed a problem during one of their trainings, came up with an action plan and they actually followed it through. There was no additional cost. They used those (training) days to do good works for the community. Huge shout out to our dive team."" KGW-TV in Portland reported that a since-deleted Instagram account posted videos of people tossing e-scooters off bridges and into the Willamette River. ""There’s talk of them doing another mission, but it won’t be for a while,"" White said. ""The dive team trains in certain areas, there's two days every month of training. For these days, they were practicing doing recoveries and it was an extra bonus to pull those scooters out of the water."" According to The Oregonian, the e-scooters were from Lime, Bird and Razor. The bicycles appeared to be from local bike-sharing system Biketown, the newspaper reported. White said the sheriff's office coordinated with the Portland Bureau of Transportation so the companies could recover their scooters and bikes. ""The sheriff’s office hopes that all users of the e-scooters use them responsibly,"" White said. ""Our rivers are not an appropriate parking place.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/26/oregon-sheriffs-office-pulls-57-e-scooters-bikes-portland-river/1580452001/
Scooter Rage Is A Thing Now,Forbes,,National,2019,6,29,"Scooter Rage Is A Thing Now. As we progress into a new era of mobility that includes bicycles, e-bikes and e-scooters, not surprisingly there are those who are not keen on the changes. Mobility administrators and advocates in the very progressive city of Portland, Oregon, for example, just fished 57 Lime, Bird and Razor scooters and a few shared bikes out of the Willamette River, which runs through the heart of the city, reported The Oregonian. Last month, the Portland police department said the River Patrol and Dive Team were training in the Willamette River under the Hawthorne Bridge when they noticed the scooters. The divers were concerned that the scooters batteries could leak into the river, so they went back in to retrieve them. Now, because of the environmental threat, police divers will continue to monitor the situation. There is an assumption in Portland that the scooters are being tossed in the river by residents who are anti-scooter and are demonstrating a bit of uncivil disobedience to express their disapproval. The Los Angeles Times and Autoblog have reported of a ""scooter war"" going on in the city. “They throw them everywhere: in the ocean, in the sand, in the trash can,” said Robert Johnson Bey, a Venice Beach maintenance worker who regularly comes across scooter parts on the Venice Beach boardwalk, Speedway and adjoining alleys to an LA Times writer. Many urban areas like LA, Portland, Detroit, Minneapolis are swimming in scooters, which were once a children’s toy. Companies like Bird and Lime are among the best known in the scooter-sharing business, though ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft have gotten in on the action too, as well as into bike sharing service that include e-bikes. Many residents of cities are using them, but there are vocal residents who do not like the piles of scooters found in popular park destinations, alongside beaches, train stations, etc. An Instagram account called Bird Graveyard, which chronicles abuse of those using scooters, has more than 80,000 followers. In Santa Barbara, California, even college students, the obvious target audience for scooters have been burying scooters in beach sand so that potential users can’t find them. Check out this passage from a recent Washington Post article: ""The physical injuries are one thing: A 75-year-old man tripped over an abandoned scooter in San Diego and shattered his knee. A 7-year-old boy near Los Angeles reportedly had his teeth knocked out by a scooter rider. A 44-year-old woman was hit by a Bird in a Cincinnati intersection. The assailant had their Bird account suspended, while the woman got a $1,000 medical bill. And on the other side of the gutter, car-on-scooter fatalities are becoming almost commonplace. But for every broken tooth there are countless jostled states of mind, as pedestrians discover the placid streams by which they travel have been invaded en masse by machines with names like Bird and Jump and Spin and Skip."" Cities have been caught unawares of the problems associated with so many scooters. New York City is still banning e-Scooters despite their popularity across the country. Rule breakers could get hit with a $500 fine or have their scooter confiscated. Leaders in New York are reluctant to change the law and worry that scooters are too dangerous, especially in an increasingly congested Manhattan where cars, pedestrians and cyclists are already competing for limited street space. Cities are encouraging non-automotive mobility to address traffic congestion and air pollution. But city councils are going to need to put together actual plans to manage the use of scooters, or they won't and just issue bans like New York.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkiley5/2019/06/29/scooter-rage-is-a-thing-now/
Electric scooters have arrived in Europe — and a lot of people there hate them too,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,7,9,"Electric scooters have arrived in Europe — and a lot of people there hate them too. Barely a few months after they were introduced in several of Europe’s storied capital cities, the great electric scooter backlash has already begun. From Paris to Berlin and to Copenhagen, drunken users and poorly parked scooters have provoked the kind of visceral hatred that became synonymous with the dockless scooters’ arrival in American cities last year. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, already vowed to put an end to what she called a trend “not far from anarchy” on the roads of the French capital last month. That was before their introduction in neighboring Germany, where newspapers have since captured a nation in crisis: a man trying to steer his e-scooter onto a high-speed motorway, reports of scores of drunk e-scooter drivers and polls showing a deeply divided country. The early verdict for the scooters in Europe has been harsh. Commentators have decided they are a “dangerous” trend, “madness” and a “pest.” But supporters of e-scooters say that the initial woes can be overcome and are outweighed by the potential benefits. They hope that the electric scooters will help reduce the number of cars in congested European cities that were designed long before the advent of motorized vehicles. In less densely populated areas, e-scooters could fill gaps in public transport networks, proponents say. Recent European reactions to the beginning of the e-scooter era have echoed similar skepticism in the United States. In cities where their use is on the rise, including D.C., operators and lawmakers have been flooded with complaints over the potential threat their riders pose to pedestrians. In some places, angry residents have taken matters into their own hands and have dumped e-scooters in nearby rivers or lakes. In June, the D.C. Council said it would seek to better regulate the industry by pushing for new speed limits and overnight bans. The moves have mirrored some of the measures recently taken in European capitals — though attitudes toward the scooters vary widely. In entrepreneur-friendly Stockholm, for instance, there was little opposition when e-scooters were first introduced. But skepticism has mounted amid recent accidents, and city officials have since called for the creation of rental stations — which would be similar to rental bike racks — to prevent drivers from dumping their e-scooters in streets and parks across the city. In France — where a certain degree of distrust of corporate culture remains part of mainstream politics — authorities have proposed limiting the number of companies that offer scooter rental. The calls for tougher regulations came after Paris faced a surge in the number of companies offering e-scooters, with each of them deploying its own fleet. Within weeks, residents reported broken scooters dumped in parks and side streets. Data on European usage of e-scooters is mostly based on surveys conducted by operators themselves. In Paris, 11 percent of people said that they were using e-scooters occasionally or frequently, according to a poll in February. The number of e-scooters in the French capital is estimated to have surged beyond 20,000, but given the multitude of competitors, there are no accurate counts for the exact number currently operating on the streets of Europe. Germany’s experience over the last few weeks may cast doubt on whether more extensive regulation will be sufficient to fully address concerns over e-scooters. German authorities had set a high bar for scooter companies seeking to enter the market even before they legalized them. Users are not allowed to go faster than about 12 mph, they are urged to wear a safety helmet and are banned from sidewalks. E-Scooters also need to be equipped with an insurance sticker to meet the requirements of German bureaucracy. But there was one factor lawmakers did not account for: Europeans’ beer lust. In the Danish capital of Copenhagen, for instance, 28 people faced fines for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs over the weekend. Drunken e-scooter driving appears to be becoming a more widespread problem in Europe than initially anticipated. Within 24 hours last week, authorities in the German city of Munich caught 24 intoxicated e-scooter drivers. Some were easier to spot than others: One man under the influence of drugs was caught after he crashed into a parked police vehicle.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/07/09/electric-scooters-have-arrived-europe-lot-people-hate-them-too/
"Electric scooters are set to be the future of urban mobility, Chinese tech CEO says",CNBC,NBC,National,2019,7,11,"Electric scooters are set to be the future of urban mobility, Chinese tech CEO says. As many cities are trying to boost environmentally friendly public transit systems, Yan Li, CEO of Chinese tech company Niu Technologies, says smart electric scooters may be the future of urban mobility. Li claimed that people in cities tend to travel distances that are roughly about 10 kilometers, which makes electric scooters a better transport alternative to cars The Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech company makes electric two-wheelers that are powered by lithium-ion batteries and provide real-time telemetry data on an app. As many cities are trying to boost environmentally friendly public transit systems, one Chinese tech CEO says smart electric scooters may be the new future of urban mobility. Due to congestion in many cities, cars tend to travel at about 15 kilometers per hour, on average, while moving room in subways during rush hour is very limited in places like Beijing, according to Yan Li, CEO of Niu Technologies. “When we look at urban mobility, when we look at the data, actually, most people travel individually in the city,” he told CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal on Wednesday at the RISE Conference in Hong Kong. “We look at the best transportation mechanism for them and cars are, obviously, not a good solution.” The Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech company makes electric two-wheelers that are powered by lithium-ion batteries and provide real-time telemetry data on an app, including location, vehicle status, riding history and power statistics. The company’s products are sit-down motor scooters in the style popularized by Piaggio’s Vespa, as opposed to motorized stand-up push scooters increasingly popular in cities like San Francisco. Li claimed that people in cities tend to travel distances that are roughly about 10 kilometers, which, he said, makes his sort of electric scooters a better alternative to cars. In recent years, countries around the world have pushed for a greater adoption of electric vehicles, with China adopting various policies and subsidies. A May report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that the global stock of electric two-wheelers was about 260 million by the end of 2018. A majority of them were in China, according to the agency. “With sales in tens of millions per year, the Chinese market for electric two-wheelers is hundreds of times larger than anywhere else in the world,” the report said. Li said Niu, through Mar. 31, 2019, sold more than 710,000 electric scooters globally and all of its users clocked in around 3 billion kilometers in riding distance. The company collects around 85 terabytes of riding data to study how people use its devices, including the way they charge their batteries. Traders, meanwhile, are not wholly optimistic about the company: Its share prices are down more than 14% so far this year. For his part, Li said the decline in the stock depended on various situations including market conditions as well as the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. “It’s always difficult to talk about the share price. From our perspective, being a public company, we know we have a responsibility to create value for our shareholders,” he said. “We’re addressing people’s fundamental needs, which is urban mobility,” Li added. “People in the city need a better device to commute.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/electric-scooters-may-be-the-future-of-urban-mobility-niu-ceo-claims.html
A YouTube star was killed in the UK’s first fatal crash involving an electric scooter,Business Insider,,National,2019,7,14,"A YouTube star was killed in the UK’s first fatal crash involving an electric scooter. A YouTube star and presenter was killed after a crash between an electric scooter and a truck in London. Emily Hartridge made videos about fitness and mental health, and her most popular video had 24 million views. Multiple UK news outlets said that it was the first fatality involving electric scooters in the UK, where they are illegal to ride on public roads but their increasing popularity could lead to a law change. Police said that a woman in her 30s was killed in the crash, and multiple UK news outlets identified Hartridge as the victim while YouTubers and TV presenters paid tribute. A YouTube star and presenter was killed in an electric scooter crash in what is believed to be the first fatal crash involving one of the scooters in the UK. An announcement on Emily Hartridge's official Instagram account on Saturday said that Hartridge ""was involved in an accident yesterday and passed away."" ""We all loved her to bits and she will never be forgotten. She has touched so many lives it's hard to imagine things without her,"" the post said. London's Metropolitan Police said that a woman in her 30s died at the scene after a crash between an electric scooter and a truck on Friday. Multiple UK outlets, including the BBC, The Guardian, and Sky News, identified Hartridge, 35, as the victim. Hartridge had almost 50,000 Instagram followers and almost 350,000 subscribers on YouTube, while her most popular video has 24 million views. She posted regularly about topics like mental health, fitness, and sex. Sky News reported that she was due to host a mental health event on Saturday, and wrote that she wanted to ""create a safe space where women could talk about whatever they wanted and feel supported by other women who have gone through similar experiences."" She was also was also an actress, appeared in the short series ""Sketch My Life"" and the series ""Oh S**t I'm 30."" YouTube Creators said in a statement that it was ""deeply saddened"" to learn of her death, while other YouTubers and UK TV presenters also paid tribute. Sky News and The Guardian said that the crash is believed to be the first fatal crash involving an electric scooter in the UK. It is not known what kind of scooter was involved in the crash. In the US, at least 11 deaths involving electric scooters were recorded between January 2018 and June 2019. In 2018, they were found to be involved in at least 1,545 accidents in the US. Riding electric scooters is illegal on public roads in the UK, but in influx of electric scooter companies have meant that they are still sometimes used. The UK government is considering dropping the ban as a result. The UK's transport minister is meeting with the heads of major scooter companies including Bird and Lime next week to tell them that they need to tell customers about the current law when selling their products, according to The Guardian.",https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-star-presenter-emily-hartridge-killed-electric-scooter-crash-2019-7
"After death of YouTube star, Amazon will push for e-scooter safety warnings in the U.K.",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,7,18,"After death of YouTube star, Amazon will push for e-scooter safety warnings in the U.K. The warnings will remind users that the devices are forbidden on public roads and sidewalks. Wherever electric scooters have appeared around the globe, severe injuries have followed. Now the United Kingdom — where motorized scooters are banned from public roads and sidewalks — is seeking to publicize the danger associated the devices. The Department of Transport, which oversees British transportation networks, has persuaded Amazon, the global e-commerce giant, to pressure electronic scooter manufacturers to make clear in their online listings that their devices cannot be used on public roads. The Sunday Times reported that the DOT wrote to multiple retailers, including Amazon, six months ago “to remind them about ‘responsible advertising.’” (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) “We have confirmed we will write to sellers of electronic scooters to ask them to amend the wording on their listings to say that the scooters cannot be used on the public highway,"" an Amazon spokesperson told The Washington Post after being reached by e-mail. ""I’m afraid I can’t go into any more detail than that.” The spokesman added that the potential change would apply only in the United Kingdom, where people routinely flout the ban on the increasingly popular devices, according to the Independent. The government action was a reaction to several devastating accidents and one high-profile death in recent days that have focused public attention on the dangers of electric scooters. The Independent reported that a teenage boy was badly injured in London and another teenager sustained a serious head injury after crashing into a bus stop outside London. A day earlier, a well-known YouTube star was struck and killed by a truck while riding a scooter in London, according to news reports. Emily Hartridge’s channel featuring videos on relationships, health and gender attracted hundreds of thousands of followers. She was 35. Hatridge’s death was the first involving an electric scooter rider in the UK, though similar fatalities have occurred in the United States. Last month, Consumer Reports confirmed that at least eight people in the U.S. have died while using rentable, dockless scooters since the fall of 2017. Thousands more have been badly injured riding the devices or after being struck by them on public sidewalks, leading to an influx of injuries at emergency rooms around the nation, according to doctors surveyed by The Post over the last year. Many accident victims have claimed the devices malfunctioned while they were riding, leading them to crash. Scooters have been documented catching fire, breaking apart in use and braking excessively, catapulting riders onto the pavement. In many cases, doctors say, the injuries are severe and involve the kind of breaks, lacerations and brain trauma typically seen in car and moped accidents. More than a year after the scooters’ arrival, the first wave of injury statistics associated with scooters has begun to emerge. A study published in January in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that more people were injured while riding standing electric scooters than by riding bicycles or traveling on foot in the year ending August 2018. Of the 249 patients who received treatment for scooter-related injuries, nearly 28 percent suffered contusions, sprains and lacerations. About 30 percent had fractures, and just over 40 percent were treated for head injuries, the study found. Nearly all the patients went home after being treated in emergency rooms, but 15 were admitted to a hospital, including two with severe head injuries who were placed in intensive care units. “The Riders share roads with fast-moving vehicular traffic but appear to underestimate hazards; we found that 94.3% of observed riders in our community were not wearing a helmet,” the study said of scooter users.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/18/after-death-youtube-star-amazon-will-push-e-scooter-safety-warnings-uk/
Op-Ed: Are scooters a transit solution or a Trojan Horse for big tech to colonize our public spaces?,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,7,19,"Op-Ed: Are scooters a transit solution or a Trojan Horse for big tech to colonize our public spaces? Summer is here and the electronic hum of scooters is filling city sidewalks all over the world. From L.A. to D.C., many American downtowns have hit their one-year anniversary with scooters, and European capitals have begun to allow them. The benefit is obvious: Scooters provide on-demand, affordable mobility to any able-bodied smartphone user. As the vehicle’s fan base grows, however, so do the frustrations that provoke other urbanites to detest them — abandoned scooters left on walkways and even scooter-pedestrian collisions. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo says escalating tensions are leading to “anarchy” on her city’s boulevards and footpaths. And an even bigger issue looms over arguments for and against this revamped child’s toy. Scooters may well be the Trojan Horse with which big tech colonizes the world’s public space. Scooters (and dockless e-bikes) inhabit cities like few other consumer products ever have. Through location-tracking and app-based transactions, scooter barons oversee their business from a distance while storing their entire inventories on our streets and sidewalks for next to nothing. When in use, scooters generate revenue for Bird, Lime or some other “micro-mobility” company. When not in use, they just sit there, wherever there happens to be: a bike lane, a doorway, a neighbor’s front yard. Citizens have no lawful recourse, leading some to resort to micro-vandalism. Scooters’ success in spite of the persistent backlash is a warning about whether tech can succeed in leveraging public space. A playbook seems to be taking shape. First, identify a point of friction in urban life (such as “the last-mile problem” in public transportation). Next, develop a profitable solution and deploy it in cities and ask for permission later. When people howl, let your early adopters fight the battle for you — use them as a shield whenever critics speak ill of your business model. Finally, push aggressive expansion while voicing support for sensible regulations that are essentially unenforceable. Like Uber and Airbnb before them, scooter companies aim to satisfy their customers with little regard for how their businesses affect our cities’ ecosystems. All three services tamper with neighborhood norms in ways that are annoying at first and deeply disturbing upon further inspection. Via Airbnb, for instance, a quaint bungalow surrounded by family homes suddenly becomes a bachelor party pad replete with fresh groups of drunken idiots each weekend. Annoying. But what’s far more worrisome is recent data indicating that Airbnb is worsening the housing crisis in cities like Los Angeles and New Orleans. Landlords love Airbnb: Why lease a place to lower-income tenants for $900 a month when you can earn double by renting it out here and there to well-off tourists? When residential units are converted into the equivalent of chic motels, the pool of long-term housing decreases and rental prices rise. As for Uber and other ride-sharing apps, originally framed as a solution to urban congestion, they are instead putting more cars on the road, making traffic worse. A San Francisco study found that bumper-to-bumper delays soared 62% from 2010 to 2016, and roughly half of this increase was caused by ride-sharing vehicles. Very few riders are choosing to share trips with other passengers and rates of car ownership in the city remain steady. The big loser has been public transit, particularly buses, whose ridership has decreased nearly 13% — a drop that presents grave challenges to a service that is both more affordable and energy efficient than Uber’s fleet of vehicles. Now, as big tech monetizes curbs and doorways and sidewalks, we’re seeing the marginalization of non-motorists who, by choice or necessity, traverse the city on their own power. Scooters at rest and in motion create barriers for parents with strollers, frail elderly pedestrians and especially the disabled. It is perturbing for a jogger or cyclist to come upon an abandoned scooter blocking their path. That this happens regularly to wheelchair users and the visually impaired is unconscionable. Decades of activism and legal battles to secure ADA accommodations in the built environment are being causally brushed aside in the name of enhancing mobility for those who can easily walk. Granted, it’s early days for scooters; perhaps a solution will emerge. But soon it won’t just be scooters anymore. In Amazon’s office parks and Google’s test towns, drone services are being readied to pick up and drop off items at a slab of concrete near you. Even Georgia Tech’s library is using drones to fly books around campus to students too busy to swing by the stacks. Eight states have recently passed legislation that will allow delivery robots to roam the sidewalks. Meanwhile, wannabe Zuckerbergs that no one yet knows about are learning from scooters and dreaming up the next big thing they can plop all over the place. The scooter experiment proves how difficult it is to establish a retroactive ban after some residents have already fallen in love with a new disruptive gadget. Absent better laws anticipating the takeover, the next battles, too, are likely to be lost on Day 1.",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-18/scooters-bird-uber-airbnb-tech-public-space
"Why E-Scooters Are on the Rise, Along With Injuries",Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2019,7,19,"Uber, Lyft, Others Must Face Disability Bias Suit Over Scooters. It’s been less than two years since the first crop of stand-up electric scooters for rent were dumped on a city sidewalk, but they can now be found around the world. Startups including Bird, Lime, Skip and Spin allow riders to locate and unlock scooters with an app. When they reach their destination, they just walk away -- or hop into a train or taxi to continue the trip. Some urban planners consider shared scooters, along with shared bike services, the future of city transport. But after several fatal accidents and many more injuries involving e-scooters some officials, drivers and pedestrians see the fledgling mode of transport as a safety hazard that must be stopped. 1. Why the boom in scooters? Cars often aren’t the quickest way to travel in dense, urban areas. Many cities looked to bicycle-sharing services and bike lanes as a better option for shorter trips and as a way to reduce carbon emissions. Electric scooters, which can cost less than $2 per ride, are an offshoot of that. Investors looking for the next Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., the app-based car-hailing services, are adding to scooter mania by pouring money into the startups, touching off a city-by-city race to become the premier scooter brand. Not to be left behind, even Uber and Lyft are launching competing scooter businesses. 2. How widespread have they become? Bird, started by a former executive of Lyft and Uber, and its main rival Lime both operate scooter services in over 100 cities worldwide. Bird kicked off the trend in late 2017 with its launch in Santa Monica, California. Unlike certain bike rentals that have to be left in designated racks, dockless scooters can be left on any public sidewalk after a rider is finished with their journey. They are then picked up at night by freelance contractors, charged and returned to designated pickup areas. 3. What kind of resistance did they run into? Scores of unattended vehicles on city sidewalks have resulted in pushback from people complaining of urban chaos, and some cities have started to cap the number of scooters they’ll allow. In January, officials in Austin, Texas, suspended licensing for rental e-scooters and bikes in order to reassess the safety and reliability of the devices. Austin has as many as 14,000 dockless electric scooters, according to data from the city’s transportation department. Other U.S. cities have much smaller fleets. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency recently suggested it would double the number of scooters permitted on its streets from 1,250 to 2,500, but only if scooter companies sign up more low-income customers. 4. What about outside the U.S.? Bird and Lime have expanded aggressively into Europe in the last year; Paris has an estimated 20,000 e-scooters. Lime Chief Executive Brad Bao announced in June that the company will soon drop thousands of electric scooters on German roads after lawmakers legalized them in May, with speed limits and other conditions. Bird and Lime have also established a presence in Spain, Portugal and other European countries as well as the Middle East and Latin America. 5. Have any countries barred them? Yes, most notably the U.K. Strict laws there classify the scooters as motor vehicles that require drivers’ licenses and are subject to tax and insurance. In March, the U.K. government opened a major review of current mobility laws -- including some that date back to 1835 -- during which the ban on e-scooters will be reconsidered. But the restrictive laws have not stopped Brits from joining in on the micro-mobility craze. Privately owned electric scooters are widely used in cities such as London, despite riders risking fines and penalty points on their driving licenses if stopped by the police. Stand-up e-scooters have also been banned on roads in major Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing since 2016, but they are still prevalent in “closed spaces” such as parks. Scooter manufacturing is a booming industry in China; that’s where the vast majority of e-scooters used globally are made. 6. Is this a profitable business? No, but investors think it can be: The valuations of Bird and Lime are almost $2.5 billion each. But skepticism is warranted. It could be just a fad. Even if it isn’t, scooter companies must have the capital to absorb costs beyond acquiring fleets of vehicles, including maintaining them and charging their batteries daily. There’s little reason for riders to be loyal to one company, and if rivals compete by lowering prices, they could shave away much of their margins. Lime has said it can raise revenue from advertising, but this is an untested idea. Scooters could end up being one option in an integrated transportation service providing everything from short-term car rentals and bike-shares to ride-hailing and train tickets, putting the upstarts at a disadvantage to Uber, which is moving in this direction. 7. Are they safe? Some officials worry they are not. Safety concerns are prompting bans in several cities around the world and are also making lawmakers hesitant to legalize e-scooters in certain countries and states. A number of fatal accidents involving scooters have renewed concerns about their safety. A YouTube star was killed in London in July after her privately owned scooter was hit by a truck, making her the first person in the U.K. to die while riding one. Some U.S. officials have also cited safety concerns in their opposition to electric scooters. Nashville’s mayor said in June that he would recommend banning them after a 26-year-old resident died in a scooter accident, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, banned dockless electric scooters and bikes for six months in July. The public health impact from electric scooters is “generally unknown,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. But Consumer Reports reported in February that there have been about 1,500 incidents of people seeking treatment for e-scooter-related injuries in the U.S. since late 2017. A study of medical records by the CDC of people who used emergency services from September to November in Austin, Texas, also found that almost half of scooter-related injuries were “severe.” The Reference Shelf One Bloomberg reporter writes of his frustration with anti-scooter rules in London.

Bird Is Said to Raise New Funding at $2.5 Billion Valuation,New York Times,,National,2019,7,22,"Bird Is Said to Raise New Funding at $2.5 Billion Valuation. Bird, a start-up that rents out electric scooters, is being valued at $2.5 billion in a new funding round led by the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to three people with knowledge of the deal.The funding puts Bird’s valuation slightly above the $2.3 billion that it was pegged at last year. At the time, the $2.3 billion figure represented double the start-up’s previous valuation, as venture capital investors fought to pour money into scooter start-ups.But that eagerness has deflated over the past year as investors have questioned whether the scooter companies can make money. The scooters have been subject to vandalism and theft, and early models were not very durable and lasted only a few months. Furthermore, after the recent tepid initial public offerings for Uber and Lyft, investors have thought twice about pouring money into unprofitable transportation start-ups with untested business models.[Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]The total capital that Bird will raise in the new fund-raising has not been finally decided, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Bird said last year it had raised a total of $418 million in funding.A Bird spokeswoman declined to comment. Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which previously invested in Bird, declined to comment on the funding but said in a statement that Bird’s team “exemplifies grit.” TechCrunch earlier reported Bird’s new valuation.Based in Santa Monica, Calif., Bird began operating in 2017. The company grew quickly as it brought fleets of scooters to cities around the country. Competitors also proliferated, including Lime, Skip, Lyft, and Spin, which is owned by Ford, and Jump, which is owned by Uber. Regulators soon resisted the scooters, with cities creating rules for the start-ups, including requiring permits, setting caps on fleet sizes and mandating speed limits.Bird has invested in upgrading its fleet to heavier, more durable scooters. Last year, it introduced a new model that lasts an average of 10 months, the company said, and makes up more than 75 percent of the fleet. Travis VanderZanden, Bird’s chief executive, recently said in a tweet that the company made $1.27 on every ride, including all costs. He said revenue had increased fourfold since last year.Bird has worked to reduce its costs by cutting staff and slowing down its expansion plans. It has also experimented with direct sales of its scooters and monthly rentals.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/technology/bird-scooters-valuation.html
"California company nabs unwanted Bird, Lime scooters and demands payment",Fox Business,Fox,National,2019,7,25,"California company nabs unwanted Bird, Lime scooters and demands payment. Two California men said San Diego is “overrun with scooters,” and that’s why they started a business that removes the scooters and locks them up until the owners pay. When riders of rental electric scooters from companies like Bird and Lime leave the scooters blocking areas like wheelchair ramps, driveways or doors, ScootScoop says property owners can call them to remove the unwanted vehicles for free. After removing the scooters, the company stores them in storage containers and sends a bill to the owner for removal and storage to release them, according to ScootScoop’s website. They also said they can get a customer's property listed as a no-parking zone for rental devices in the apps. The company is a partnership between John Heinkel, a repo man, and Dan Borelli, who co-owns a bike rental shop in the area, The Verge reported. They said they’ve impounded thousands of dockless e-scooters around San Diego. “We aren’t just grabbing scooters off the street and throwing them in a yard,” Borelli told The Verge. “We write a parking ticket for every single one we have.” They charge scooter companies $30 for pick-up, plus $2 per day a scooter is stored, capping the fee after a month, according to the report. ScootScoop operates with something of a “ask forgiveness, not permission” style similar to the way the companies like Bird and Lime have dropped their scooters in cities across the country without seeking permission from local governments. It looked like it would pay off for ScootScoop, at first. Bird paid them $40,000 for 1,800 scooters they’d impounded in 2018, The Verge reported. Now, Lime and Bird are both suing ScootScoop. In April, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the companies were accusing ScootScoop of holding their property hostage for “ransom.” Borelli told The Verge that “ransom” is “a fake bully word that’s been made up to make our character look worse.” A Bird spokesperson told the Union-Tribune that San Diego residents were “being bamboozled” by ScootScoop and that the removal company was “robbing people of the environmentally friendly scooter options they’ve come to rely on.” Bird alleged ScootScoop has been pulling scooters from public sidewalks, according to The Verge. The company wants ScootScoop to pay them four times what ScootScoop has attempted to bill them, plus punitive damages. Heinkel and Borelli denied the allegation. ScootScoop could have a lot of business ahead if they don’t lose the lawsuits. Electric scooters passed station-based bicycles as the most popular form of shared transportation outside of public transit and cars in the U.S., the Associated Press reported earlier this year. Riders took 38.5 million rides on shared electric scooters last year. In San Diego, as in many other cities, local officials are trying to take control of the situation. The city implemented new regulations this month, requiring scooter companies to obtain insurance, free the city from liability and obtain permits for every scooter in circulation, The Verge reported.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/california-company-bird-lime-scooters-payment
Ford’s scooter company launches aggressive expansion plan with next-gen scooter,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,7,25,"Ford’s scooter company launches aggressive expansion plan with next-gen scooter. Spin will deploy 15,000 scooters over the next few months. Spin, the dockless scooter company acquired by Ford Motor Company last year, announced on Thursday that it will deploy 15,000 scooters in eight cities starting in August. The company also unveiled its latest model of electric scooter, with anti-theft technology and custom parts meant to deter vandalism. Spin has been expanding since it was bought by Ford in November 2018, but today’s news marks a more rapid stage of growth. At the time of its acquisition, the San Francisco-based company operated rentable electric scooters in nine cities and on five college campuses. Today, that number has grown to 47 cities and campuses. Starting in August, Spin plans to deploy thousands of new scooters on the streets of Portland; Los Angeles; Denver; Washington, DC; Kansas City; Memphis; and Minneapolis, with more cities to follow. The new scooter is manufactured in China by Segway-Ninebot, a Chinese-American company backed by Xiaomi, the world’s predominant scooter-maker. Here are some specs of the new scooter: Larger frame, strengthened mechanical structure, and wider and longer platform More intuitive and responsive bike handle braking system Bigger (10-inch) tubeless tires, which provide better shock absorption over rough terrain and conditions Rear drive high efficiency for improved acceleration and uphill performance Custom security screws exclusively developed and manufactured for Spin’s scooters to deter tampering and vandalism Significantly extended battery life, enabling each scooter to ride up to 37.5 miles on a full charge Upgraded Spin authentication system that is uniquely associated with its modules While much smaller than its rivals in dockless scooter sharing like Bird and Lime, Spin has Ford as a parent company, which potentially gives it a much longer runway to scale its business without worrying too much about making a profit. The dockless scooter industry has hit many bumps on the road in that past year, including problems with vandalism, injured riders, and a product that broke down too quickly for the companies to recoup their costs. Bird, which reportedly lost $100 million in three months, is seeking new funding at a valuation of $2.5 billion. Spin conducted a pilot test of its new scooter in Baltimore in late June, but it’s too soon for the company to determine the scooter’s average lifespan (i.e., how long it can stay in service before breaking down), CEO Derrick Ko said. “However, based on our data so far, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement over our current second-generation scooter,” Ko said in a statement.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/8929994/ford-spin-scooter-expansion-next-gen-model
Editorial: How much responsibility do scooter companies have for the bad behavior of their users? A lot,Los Angeles Times,LA Times,National,2019,7,30,"Editorial: How much responsibility do scooter companies have for the bad behavior of their users? A lot. Forget about presidential politics. The most controversial and divisive issue in Los Angeles these days may be scooters. Over the last few months, some 36,000 shared electric scooters and bicycles have been allowed onto the city’s streets, as part of a one-year pilot program to study how so-called micromobility vehicles can be used and regulated in L.A. In some neighborhoods, you can’t travel a block without seeing a scooter parked on — or dumped on — the sidewalk, and customers have taken around 2 million rides since the beginning of the year. But the city is split at the moment into two camps: scooter lovers, who say the rent-per-ride vehicles are a cheap, convenient way to travel short distances without getting into a car, thereby helping reduce tailpipe pollution and traffic congestion. And scooter haters, who say the vehicles are big, possibly dangerous toys being used irresponsibly and left cluttering the sidewalks when the joy ride is over. They’re both right. The scooter lovers are certainly correct that in this traffic-clogged, smoggy city, people need more travel alternatives to cars. Shared scooters and bikes are especially helpful as “first-mile, last-mile” vehicles to move people between their homes or jobs and transit stations. The growing number of scooter riders helps build the case for more protected lanes and redesigned roads that make the streets safer for bicyclists, scooter riders and walkers too. But the skeptics raise legitimate gripes about the private companies that have, in some neighborhoods, inundated public spaces with scooters but failed to hold their customers accountable. So far, the companies have talked about educating riders and offering them incentives for good behavior, but problems persist. (During the first five months of the pilot project, the city received more than 3,000 complaints about scooters through its 311 app.) How much responsibility should scooter companies bear for the rude, irresponsible or downright dangerous behavior of their customers? A lot. Scooter companies have essentially introduced a new type of vehicle to the transportation landscape. They have an obligation to make sure their customers know the rules of the road and adhere to the proper etiquette governing how to ride and park the vehicles. After mostly welcoming scooters with open arms, Los Angeles officials are now considering following the lead of Chicago and some other cities and fining companies when rules or laws are broken. The city already requires companies to respond within two hours to complaints of broken, toppled or improperly parked scooters. If the companies are unresponsive over a long period, they eventually risk losing their permit to operate. Now, new penalties are being proposed, ranging from $50 for failing to respond to a service request within two hours to $1,500 if a company’s customers repeatedly and consistently park their scooters improperly. (Separately, the Los Angeles Police Department has begun ticketing riders for riding on the sidewalk, which isn’t allowed.) Ideally, the city won’t need to levy steep penalties on companies. Scooters are still new, and some of the problems may resolve themselves if scooters become less of a novelty and more of a regular mode of transportation. Nevertheless, fines could help prod companies to be more proactive in managing their scooters and their customers, particularly if those companies choose to pass the fine along to offending riders, which would be another incentive for good behavior. Scooters companies have one big incentive already for being good stewards of the public space — many cities have banned shared, dockless vehicles from operating within their jurisdictions. It’s not hard to imagine that if residents complain enough about bad scooter behavior, Los Angeles will also consider a severe crackdown or even a ban. And other cities would likely follow. That would be a shame. If scooters are ever going to be taken seriously as a transportation solution, then companies have to do a better job getting their customers to be responsible riders.",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-30/scooters-bird-penalties-los-angeles
The Battle Over Scooter Impound In San Diego May Help Cities Improve Scooter Hygiene,Forbes,,National,2019,7,30,"The Battle Over Scooter Impound In San Diego May Help Cities Improve Scooter Hygiene. An interesting fight is taking place in San Diego between scooter companies like Lime and Bird, and a ""repo man"" who has discovered a business impounding scooters improperly parked on private property. He impounds the scooters, then charges the companies a surprisingly reasonable $30 plus $2/day to get them back. Accusations of bad activity have flung in both directions, including allegations that Lime Juicers and Bird Hunters (free-lance people who collect and recharge scooters for a fee) have been trying to break into his impound lots to collect the large bounty, and allegations that he's impounding scooters that he should not. The story is interesting though. These dockless scooters are absolutely wonderful, by far the most energy and congestion efficient form of motorized transportation out there, using less than a quarter of the energy per person-mile of even the most efficient electric subways. We should keenly want them to work. But various actions, such as scooters left in inappropriate locations, and risky or bad driving by scooter users, have made cities and residents angry at them. Disclaimer: I am an investor/advisor to a nascent startup attempting to solve some of these problems through scooters that can move autonomously, so I have a bias towards our solutions. Nonetheless, I am interested in all sorts of solutions. Tow and impound is an ancient solution to improper parking for a long time, though it's naturally much hated by those towed. The ""Scootscoop"" team claim they are only removing scooters from private property under arrangement with the property owners. Bird has sued them and accused them of ""ransoming"" scooters. If -- and it's a big if -- an impound regimen could work in an ideal fashion, it would address many of the problems people have with where scooters are parked. An impound scheme would quickly motivate all the scooter companies to make sure that customers only leave scooters in approved locations. They could use GPS, the photos they make customers take of the scooter after they park it and fines and penalties to force customers to park properly. If you knew that you would personally pay the fine if you parked a scooter improperly, you would take more care. The scooter companies will not be keen to do this. Punishing customers scares away customers. If you ban customers they can come back with a new phone number or credit card, but you don't really want to ban them. But they would do it if they were getting high fines to recover impounded scooters. The big problem is the potential for fraud and malice of several sorts. The difficulty is that a scooter can be moved after it is parked, from a proper location to an illegal one. Or somebody can claim that a scooter was moved. Unscrupulous impounders could move scooters into unlawful areas and then impound them. It would be pretty lucrative. They would just claim that somebody else moved it. ""Haters"" of the scooter companies, who today are known to damage scooters for non-monetary reasons, could move scooters into improper areas in the hope they would be impounded. They could even call the impounder. The two could secretly work together. Scooter companies could work a bit against this. Through the use of accelerometers, microphones or cameras in the scooters, they could have evidence that a scooter was moved and when, though they probably would not see who did it. This might not mean the impounder did anything wrong unless it's clear the scooter was moved immediately before impounding, which unethical impounders would be smart enough not to do. Scooter companies could also (at some cost) find ways to make video recordings of even a small number of move-and-impound frauds. If caught in a clear fraud, impounders could lose their license to impound, of course, and possibly face large civil and criminal penalties. It is much harder to catch ""haters,"" who today happily post videos online of themselves destroying scooters with no fear of repercussions. Unfortunately, GPS is not accurate enough to guide customers to proper parking spaces, which will often be just a few feet from improper ones. So training customers to park well could be a very difficult challenge. If there were a camera in the scooters (there currently is not) one can imagine a more advanced robot localization tool (in the cloud) which figured the exact position and helped better, but that's a big add-on for the scooter makers. Once scooter companies accept the idea of impounding, they could take steps to assure their recharge/reposition contractors do not try to steal impounded scooters. In fact, chances are -- though it sounds like a protection racket -- they would come to an arrangement with the impounders, who would instead recharge and reposition the improperly parked scooters, rather than impound them, for a mutually agreed upon fee. It's also possible to imagine an app-based scheme which keeps most sides happy. Consider a system that starts with a tool to let private property owners tag a scooter as parked on their private property using an app to scan the code found on every scooter: Property owner tags the scooter. This starts a clock. Scooter operator is informed immediately about improper scooter. It has a short period of time -- 10 to 15 minutes to declare what it is going to do about it. Options could include promising to remove it by some deadline, paying the property owner/resident to accept it or move it, or accepting the risk of impound. The company might immediately phone or signal the customer who left it in the wrong place, hoping they are close enough to fix the problem. It might penalize them if they don't fix it, or if they say they will fix it and don't by the deadline. After the deadline, or if the company accepts the risk of impound, then an impound company can be notified. If the company moves the scooter after that notification, and the impound company arrives to find nothing, there may be a fine on the company. Impound companies could charge a standard fee for recovery and storage, but would always be free to negotiate a lower fee, or a fee that includes recharging and positioning. It's a little more complex for bad parking in public places. Reporting could still be done by property residents adjacent to the public spaces, but there is a risk that the boundaries and rules for public space should only be enforced by bonded officials. None of this touches on the other main problem cities have, namely safety and illegal driving of the scooters on sidewalks. But it's a start.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/07/30/the-battle-over-scooter-impound-in-san-diego-may-help-cities-improve-scooter-hygiene/
One month with a Bird rental scooter: far worse than a bike,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,7,31,"One month with a Bird rental scooter: far worse than a bike. Bird’s monthly program sticks you with a less capable, more annoying scooter. Riding down Market Street on my Bird scooter last month, wearing AirPods and staying out of the way of much faster-moving cyclists weaving around me as I chugged along at a painful 12 miles per hour, I began to think that maybe I was the problem. I ride my bike to work. I’ve done so most days here in San Francisco over the last six years or so, and I know what all those cyclists are thinking: “Who is this tech bro doofus, obliviously riding in the bike lane on a speed-capped scooter with poor braking capabilities? I hope he face plants.” I’ve thought that many times about aggressive Boosted Board riders and daredevil OneWheel balance boarders and truly death wish-having individuals daring to use those InMotion electric unicycles. I’ve thought all of them are putting in an extreme amount of effort to avoid using a good old-fashioned bike. Yet, little do my fellow cyclists know that while the AirPods are, in fact, mine (and I take full responsibility for that), the scooter is not. It’s a rental, a monthly one to be precise. This being San Francisco, which has banned Bird until it jumps through the necessary regulatory hoops, this scooter wasn’t picked up off the street. It was taken down the elevator in my apartment building where I store and charge it. The rental is part of a new program the scooter company is trying out in San Francisco, Barcelona, and Miami. (The Florida city was added to the list earlier this month.) What makes San Francisco stand out, in particular, is that it’s a city where Bird hasn’t blanketed the streets in dockless electric vehicles because it legally can’t. As of June of this year, Bird owns scooter company Scoot, which is allowed here. But Scoot’s presence remains relatively limited compared to the city’s only other permit holder Skip, which accounted for 90 percent of all rides in the city over the past six months. For Bird, the purpose of this monthly program is two-fold. It’s an experiment with a different business model, considering its current one is starting to look fairly suspect. The company continues to bleed cash — it lost $100 million in three months this year — trying to expand into new markets and drive down the cost it pays on each ride. The monthly program is also a way for Bird to boost its profile in the home of Silicon Valley, the birthplace of the ride-hailing movement from which it drew its inspiration, while it gets Scoot up to speed and, hopefully, convinces San Francisco to let it move in, too. As someone who has found scooters to be quite useful, if a bit chaotically deployed, in destinations like Los Angeles and Austin, I thought it would be a great experiment to see how well Bird’s monthly one fared as a daily transportation option here. After all, San Francisco is a small and dense enough city that scooters could make a huge difference, potentially encouraging an increasingly affluent base of tech industry commuters to ditch cars in favor of cleaner transportation. Unfortunately, after using this Bird scooter for 30 days or so, I can confidently say my suspicions as a cyclist were more or less on the nose. I should just be using a bike because a bike is, in most cases, less annoying and faster than this particular model of Bird scooter. Also, a bike never runs out of batteries. But the core issue runs deeper. Bird and its fellow electric scooter providers have experienced a meteoric rise because of a simple premise: a scooter you rent spontaneously for a short period of time that you don’t have to take care of or worry about when you’re not riding it. A monthly program like this, where I’m encouraged to use it every day and liable for its well-being, injects all sorts of complications. It betrays the breezy, carefree pillar of the “micromobility” trend that is, effectively, Bird’s core business. I’d be singing a different tune if the scooter was better. In fact, if these scooters improved, the monthly rental program could become central to its growth. Bird is offering rentals for the low price of $24.99 a month, but it’s giving you a dinky, slow scooter with about 50 percent of the battery capacity of its standard dockless one. It’s also capped at about 5 mph slower than those I was riding in LA just last month. Those LA scooters really cruised and made a strong case for Bird’s presence in dense metropolitan areas where public transit is lacking and you often have to walk two to three miles to your destination. If you want the best scooter Bird provides, called the Bird One, you’ll soon be able to buy one outright for $1,299. That gets you a premium e-scooter with a 19 mph top speed, 30 miles of range, and a 220-pound max weight. If I could rent that scooter, even for as much as $40 or $50 a month, I would in a heartbeat. (The company is also developing its own moped.) Bird tells me that it currently offers “a few different models for personal rentals,” but the one I have is the one advertised on the monthly program’s website, and I have yet to see a different one around the city. In most cases, scooters are a total blast to use and less strenuous than biking. They’ll also get you where you need to be for less money than an Uber or Lyft ride — and at roughly the same cost as public transit. After all, scooters caught on because there are quite a few people out there who legitimately like riding them and see them as useful. The Bird monthly rental scooter checks a lot of those boxes before you start to run up against the compromises. I found the process of having it delivered to be relatively seamless: a Bird employee locked it up in front of my apartment during a four-hour time slot during a predesignated delivery day. From there, you control the vehicle through the Bird app, scanning its barcode to activate it and using a built-in locking mechanism to free it from whatever it’s tied to. Those activation and locking mechanisms are kept separate. So you can choose to tell the app when the scooter is not locked to something, in the event you’re keeping it in your apartment or garage, and you can still turn it on. That occasionally led to some weird app hiccups where Bird thought my scooter was on when it wasn’t or unlocked when it was tethered to a bike rack. But most of the issues were fixed with an app reset, although that could take a frustrating amount of time when you needed to get somewhere fast. Occasionally, a bug in Bird’s app would prevent me from unlocking the scooter, but that was relatively rare. As far as riding goes, the Bird feels like a standard e-scooter, just slower. It did terribly on hills (as expected), and on downhill slopes, it seems to purposefully engage the electric brake to keep you from careening out of control, which is a nice safety touch I sometimes wish wasn’t there so I could coast. The worst parts about the rental were its battery capacity and the act of physically lugging the thing around when I wasn’t able to ride it. For instance, to get it into my apartment, I often have to keep the scooter activated. If you turn it off and you try to push it along the ground, the scooter will incessantly beep at you as part of its anti-theft measures. It’s not clear why this feature is deployed on these monthly scooters. As a result, I’m pushing an activated scooter into an elevator, waiting until I get it into my apartment, and then turning it off. (Thankfully, the throttle won’t kick in until you push off with your feet.) Only at that point can I actually plug it in to charge it. Getting the scooter out of my apartment, down some stairs, or up the hill next to my building (which it can’t physically ride up because its motor is too weak) was equally frustrating. The deal-breaker, however, is the battery. It lasts me, on average, about 7.5 to 8 miles on a charge. That means I could make the 2.2-mile ride to my office and back two days out of the week, and it would require a full overnight charge. If I decided to ride it anywhere else — to a friend’s place or to run an errand — it would have about 30 percent left after just a day. That’s not so bad if you have somewhere to put it in your apartment every night, but I have a cluttered living room, and it wasn’t easy to make space for it. My garage was also not an ideal environment to keep it in every night, charging and unlocked (our bike rack isn’t close to an outlet), because I feared it would get stolen. We’ve had bikes stolen in the past, and Bird says you’re on the hook for the full price of the scooter if it gets nabbed or suffers serious damage. The company pointed me to a part of its rental FAQ that indicated that it would charge users up to $500 for a lost or stolen scooter. Knowing that you’re renting a scooter Bird considers to be worth $500 is a good indication of the quality level of the device: solid but not great and perhaps on the level of one of those Xiaomi ones you can buy on Amazon that nonetheless comes with much more range and a higher top speed. So is Bird’s program worth it? At $25 a month, it seems tantalizingly budget-conscious. And for those with short commutes who have no intention of ever biking and are just looking for a good alternative to public transit, it’s better than relying on Uber or Lyft and surely faster than walking. But Bird hasn’t done enough to justify why this scooter is necessary. You can’t pick it up off the street or drop it off wherever you like, and there are so many other options, from bikes to public transit, that better solve the problem of needing to go a short distance quickly and cheaply. When I found myself in my apartment building’s garage recently, running a little bit late for work and thinking about the risky 40 or so percent battery level of my Bird rental, I decided to take my bike instead. It’d get me to work faster and wouldn’t leave me stranded at the office at the end of the day. If Bird can start offering a monthly rental scooter that addresses those issues, I’ll be the first to sign up.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review
San Diego duo takes on electric scooter industry,Reuters,,National,2019,8,1,"San Diego duo takes on electric scooter industry. Two men in San Diego have impounded thousands of electric scooters they say have been left littered about the city and endangering pedestrians, sparking a battle with companies that have flooded cities with the two-wheelers. John Heinkel, 55, and Dan Borelli, 43, operate a small outfit called ScootScoop. They use a flatbed truck to tow away scooters they say have been left improperly around hotels or other private properties. In just over a year of operations, they have impounded more than 12,500 electric scooters, Borelli said. The electric scooter companies Bird and Lime have responded by suing them in California state court and accused them of unlawfully taking their vehicles. The battle between the men and the scooter companies underscores the chaotic legal landscape for the vehicles, which are the same size as toy scooters that many people rode as children but are powered by an electric motor. Cities in the United States and Europe have struggled with how to regulate the scooters, amid complaints from some residents and businesses that they clutter sidewalks when parked and endanger pedestrians when driven. A dozen electric scooter companies have received more than $1.5 billion in investments in total, according to a report issued earlier this year by Boston Consulting Group. Borelli describes ScootScoop as a start up in its own right, with he and Heinkel the only full-time employees. Like many start-ups, ScootScoop is not yet profitable. Most of the scooters the firm has impounded in San Diego are from Bird and Lime, but those companies are refusing to pay to retrieve their vehicles and are fighting ScootScoop in court through their lawsuits, Borelli said. ‘DEMANDING RANSOM’ Bird in a statement said ScootScoop was “unlawfully impounding micro-mobility devices and demanding a ransom for their return.” “We are seeking an immediate end to their scheme as the company is robbing people of the environmentally friendly scooter options they’ve come to rely upon each day to get to and from work, as well as to local businesses,” the company said. Lime in a statement said ScootScoop has repeatedly taken scooters that are “responsibly parked.” “Their attempts to deputize themselves as an extension of the city is not only unlawful, but it is nothing more than a property theft scheme to generate income,” Lime said. ScootScoop claims the right to impound scooters under California law when they are improperly parked on private property, and it invoices the scooter companies at least $50 per vehicle to return them, Borelli said. ScootScoop plans to auction off some scooters if it doesn’t get paid. With Bird and Lime refusing to pay, the scooters sit in ScootScoop’s compound, but not silently. As ScootScoop’s truck drove away with a load of them last week they emitted a chorus of chirping sounds designed to scare off potential thieves. San Diego city leaders earlier this year approved regulations for electric scooters that require companies to obtain permits and comply with new rules, such as ensuring that in the downtown area the scooters are only parked in certain designated “corrals.” Borelli and Heinkel said they are not personally opposed to scooters in San Diego, California’s second-largest city. “We don’t want to turn it into a war,” Borelli said. “We want to see co-existence. We want to see the scooter survive.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-scooters-idUSKCN1UR47F
"Electric scooters aren't as eco-friendly as they seem, study finds",The Guardian,,National,2019,8,2,"Electric scooters aren't as eco-friendly as they seem, study finds. Materials used in manufacturing and companies’ efforts to collect and charge scooters create significant greenhouse gas emissions. At first glance, the assertion that dockless electric scooters are more environmentally friendly than other modes of transportation seems sound. They don’t emit greenhouse gases. They don’t add to vehicle congestion. “Cruise past traffic and cut back on CO2 emissions – one ride at a time,” touts Bird, one of the most popular scooter companies in the US. But scooters are not as eco-friendly as they may seem, according to a study published on Friday. Researchers at North Carolina State University found that traveling by scooter produces more greenhouse gas emissions per mile than traveling by bus, bicycle, moped or on foot. The team discovered that while the scooters themselves were not particularly environmentally unfriendly, the materials it took to manufacture the frame, wheels and battery, as well as the companies’ efforts at the end of each day to round up the scooters, charge them and then return them to the streets, had significant impact when it came to greenhouse gas emissions. “They claim that they’re Earth-friendly and potentially carbon-free,” said the study author Joe Hollingsworth. “What we found is while they might have zero tailpipe emissions, there are definitely upstream and downstream processes that definitely do not make the processes carbon-free.” The researchers took apart the same model of scooter used for the first generation of Birds, and calculated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with putting it together. They determined that the materials and manufacturing made up about half of the scooter’s global warming impact, something that is only exacerbated when the scooters are vandalized or destroyed. And scooters, in particular, are targets for vandalism and destruction. Bird Graveyard, an Instagram account started by three friends in west Los Angeles, has more than 99,600 followers who subscribe to their documentation of scooter vandalism. One of the founders of the account, who has never disclosed his name because of the nature of the material, told the Guardian on Friday that while he has always supported the concept behind the scooters – a transportation alternative to environmentally unfriendly cars – the rollout of the scooters has made them targets of vandalism. “It’s a great idea, but it’s carried out very poorly,” he said. “People are going to do people things, and destroying it is just going to be part of it. They should have accounted for that at least somewhat and had something to counteract that.” Bird and Lime did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In 2018, people rode scooters on 38.5m trips, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Hollingsworth and the other researchers encouraged the scooter companies to “reduce collection and distribution burdens by incentivizing or requiring the use of efficient automobiles”, and centralizing management or “allowing chargers to ‘claim’ e-scooters to eliminate unnecessary and competitive driving during daily collection”. “I hope that our paper helps consumers consider what they’re actually replacing with the scooters,” he said. “Hopefully, it will help these companies to better manage how their employees are driving around to pick these scooters up to make them more efficient.”",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/02/electric-scooter-eco-friendly-greenhouse-gases

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: There's been an explosion of rented electric scooters on the streets of Paris this year, and until recently, there weren't any rules or regulations for the companies renting the scooters. Jake Cigainero reports that the city is now cracking down on those rentals. JAKE CIGAINERO, BYLINE: It seemed to happen overnight - Paris was full of electric scooters for rent, clogging walkways, grazing pedestrians as they zipped by and drawing the ire of car drivers. ARNAUD MARION: Nobody was aware of the consequences of the scooters in Paris. CIGAINERO: That's Arnaud Marion, the president of Smovengo, the company that operates Paris' famous public bicycle share system Velib. He says unlike the Velib bikes, which have to be returned to specially designated docks, the scooters caused chaos on the sidewalks. MARION: And people can leave them wherever they want. So from one day to the other, people had to manage in the footpaths with these scooters, which created difficulties for old people, for disabled people, for the moms with their children. CIGAINERO: Around a year ago, 12 rental companies dumped about 20,000 electric scooters on the already-crowded streets of Paris. The mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said it was time to end the anarchy. The new rules limit the speed of the scooters and prohibit riding and parking on the sidewalk. Now half of the companies have since pulled out, and scooter users now have to fight with motorcycle owners for the limited parking spaces. The mayor of Marseilles says he's following the Paris mayor's lead, and the French transport minister said she's planning national legislation. Supporters of the scooters say they will help reduce Paris' traffic and cut pollution, both goals of Mayor Hidalgo. Mikaela Rene uses a bicycle to get around Paris, but she does not have a problem with the scooters. MIKAELA RENE: (Speaking French). CIGAINERO: ""Cars are a bigger problem,"" she says, ""since they pollute more."" RENE: (Speaking French). CIGAINERO: ""This whole controversy about electric scooters, maybe it's a bit exaggerated,"" Rene says. Parisian Lea Marcq says she's also not entirely against the scooters but thinks the city needs to do even more to regulate them. LEA MARCQ: Actually, I've seen, like, me maybe three accidents with scooters and cars. The scooters drive very fast, and it's now dangerous for the pedestrians. CIGAINERO: Jackie Kai Ellis a Canadian who lives in Paris, is a big fan of the trottinette, as they're called in French. JACKIE KAI ELLIS: (Laughter) I really love them, yeah. CIGAINERO: She uses the scooters twice a day because they're faster than the subway. KAI ELLIS: Like, a metro ride would take 25 minutes, whereas sometimes a trottinette will be, like, seven-minute ride. You can just pick one up and then drop it off. CIGAINERO: You can be fined $150 for riding on the sidewalk. But Kaiellis says the ubiquitous construction around Paris means she has to do it sometimes. KAI ELLIS: But when I do, I go really, really slow (laughter). I do get yelled at sometimes by people. But, I mean, it's just still all kind of the whole part of it. CIGAINERO: People are also concerned about the number of accidents. Earlier this year, a pianist for the Paris Opera was bowled over by a scooter, fracturing her arm, and in June, a 25-year-old man riding a scooter in car traffic was killed in a collision with a truck.",https://www.npr.org/2019/08/02/747719489/paris-cracks-down-on-scooters-bans-them-from-being-parked-on-sidewalks
"E-Scooters are worse for the environment than many claim, study indicates",CBS News,CBS,National,2019,8,6,"E-Scooters are worse for the environment than many claim, study indicates. Electric scooters, which have exploded in popularity since 2017, claim to be carbon-free. But a new study has found they emit about half as much as a conventional car. The aluminum, rubber and lithium used to make these short-lived devices are the main culprits, the study found. Scooters are often recharged by many people driving cars, which also adds to their carbon impact. In just two years since electric scooters first widely appeared in the U.S., they've displaced shared bikes as the most popular mode of transportation. About 85,000 scooters are now available in over 100 cities, while the startups that run them—the likes of Bird, Lime, Spin, Skip and Uber and Lyft—have scooped up more than $5 billion in venture capital funding. A big reason for the explosion of scooters is their perceived eco-friendliness. ""Cut back on CO2 emissions,"" proclaims an ad by scooter startup Bird. When a person finishes a ride on a Lime scooter, the app tells them, ""Your ride was carbon free."" But the vehicles actually emit much more than they claim, a recent study concludes. For every mile driven, scooters emit about half as much as a typical car, concludes the study, titled ""Are e-scooters polluters?"" Published last week in Environmental Research Letters, it appears to be the first scientifically rigorous look at the environmental impact of these trendy devices. ""We wanted to look at the environmental impacts beyond what you'd see as a user—the aluminum that goes into the frame, the lithium-ion battery, the transport from China to the U.S., the independent contractors who are driving around in their personal vehicles at night filling them up,"" said Jeremiah Johnson, a professor of Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State who coauthored the study along with students Joseph Hollingsworth and Brenna Copeland. The researchers pointed to two environmental culprits in a scooter's existence. The first is the materials. The aluminum frame, rubber tires and lithium-ion batteries that make up a scooter account for more than half of its emissions—more so because a scooter's lifespan can be shockingly short, somewhere in the range of one to three months. (The impact of transporting the scooters from China to the U.S., by contrast, is ""trivial,"" the authors found, because the global trade network is so efficient.) Nearly as much—about 40%—comes from the process of re-charging them. At night, when few scooters are in use, an army of gig contractors collect abandoned or badly parked rides and recharge them. These collectors are paid per scooter collected and, more often that not, use their personal cars to move the rides around. The electricity used to charge a scooter makes up just under 15% of its emissions. Even with all that, scooters can be a greener form of transportation—if people choose to, say, scoot to the grocery store instead of driving. ""The challenge is, we're not typically displacing car travel with scooters,"" Johnson said. A survey in Raleigh found that only one-third of scooter trips replaced driving. Most of the rest replaced trips that would have been made on foot or by bike, both of which are essentially zero-emissions forms of transport. This study could provide impetus for cities to crack down on scooters even further. Governments have been on the warpath against these devices, which have now been implicated in eight deaths and are accused of littering up sidewalks. But industry defenders say the kinks—many of which are a product of a new, unregulated tool in an unfamiliar market—can be ironed out as the industry matures. The first generation of scooters was based on models popular in China, where people often use them for trips of a mile or less to a transit stop. ""It wasn't designed for the kind of use it's getting now, and it wasn't designed for these longer trips,"" said William Henderson, CEO of Ride Report, a software provider that helps cities track and manage scooter use. Their flimsiness is one reason that some scooter fleets have an average lifespan of under a month, Henderson said. Now some manufacturers, such as Bird, are coming out with more durable scooters, explicitly designed to carry two riders on longer trips. That leaves overnight charging and re-distributing scooters as the main driver of scooter emissions. The North Carolina State researchers recommend that scooter companies centrally manage that process so it's efficient and less polluting—as opposed to the favored method today which seems to leave charging in the hands of competing gig workers using private vehicles. Companies are likely to balk at this pricier option, but Ride Report's Henderson says it, too, is an eventual possibility. For example, Portland, Oregon, requires scooter companies in the city to report all emissions associated with their gadgets. ""Now, all of a sudden, because of the very existence of that data, you're seeing competition to reduce that,"" he said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scooters-are-worse-for-the-environment-than-many-think/
We regret to inform you that scooters aren’t actually good for the environment,Vox,Vox,National,2019,8,8,"We regret to inform you that scooters aren’t actually good for the environment. Electric scooters are worse for the planet than the modes of transportation they’re displacing, a study finds. Companies like Bird and Lime have been selling us a promise about their electric scooters: They’re great for the planet! For the most part, we’ve enthusiastically embraced this notion, and it’s helped catapult scooters into popularity. Last year, riders took about 38.5 million trips on them. But it might be time to question the climate-friendly narrative. Just because the scooters themselves don’t spew out carbon dioxide, doesn’t mean the process of making, charging, and transporting them is emission-free. In fact, on the whole, scooters are worse for the environment than the modes of transportation they’re replacing, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters. Researchers at North Carolina State University set out to determine how much harm to the climate results from each portion of a scooter’s “life cycle.” They found that most of the harm comes from manufacturing the device, which is typically done in China, and from transporting it around a city, which is typically done by — you guessed it — cars. Each night, after we’ve parked our scooters on the curb, the companies behind them pay contractors (known as “Juicers” or “Chargers”) to drive around the city and gather them, transport them to be charged, and then reposition them in places where they’ll likely be picked up in the morning. The researchers tallied up the greenhouse gas emissions used in making and moving the scooters around, as well as the relatively small amount of emissions that comes from shipping the materials from China to the US and from charging the scooters. They used all that information to calculate the total emissions per passenger mile. Then they compared that to the emissions per passenger mile produced by other modes of transportation. The result: Scooters typically produce more emissions than a standard bus with high ridership, an electric moped, an electric bicycle, a regular bicycle, or a good old carbon-free walk. The researchers also note some important survey results from Raleigh, North Carolina. If there were no scooter option available, almost half of scooter riders say they would have biked or walked instead. Both of those are more climate-friendly alternatives. Another 11 percent would’ve hopped on the bus — also a greener option if it’s got high ridership, according to the study — and 7 percent would’ve not made the trip at all. Only 34 percent say they would have used their own car or a service like Uber or Lyft. So, assuming the findings are generalizable beyond North Carolina, the idea that giving people access to scooters means they’ll decrease their reliance on cars substantially — that is, substantially enough to make up for the climate impact of the scooters themselves — turns out to be false. It’s worth noting that Lime announced last year that it would make efforts to green its fleet — for example, by buying renewable energy (it’s investing in both solar and wind). The company responded to the new study, saying, “We welcome research into the environmental benefits of new mobility options; however, this study is largely based on assumptions and incomplete data that produces high variability in the results. We believe micro-mobility will reduce pollution and mitigate climate change.” However, the findings in the new study are consistent with previous research on scooters. It looks like the advent of scooters may actually be a net negative for the planet — at least, given the way we’re putting them to use right now. How we can make scooters a legitimately green option The study isn’t all doom and despair; it also highlights the green potential of scooters and includes recommendations for deploying them more efficiently. First of all, as the study notes, “choosing an e-scooter over driving a personal automobile with a fuel efficiency of 26 miles per gallon results in a near universal decrease in global warming impacts.” In other words, scooting is definitely better than driving a car, and we shouldn’t lose sight of that basic fact. The question is whether we can get scooters to be better than buses, bikes, and other vehicles. One big challenge is that scooters just don’t last long on the mean streets of, well, pretty much any American city. In theory, they’re built to last for two years, but that doesn’t account for all the people who throw them into rivers and lakes, light them on fire, drop them into garbage cans, or otherwise vandalize them. Sometimes people do this because they’re frustrated that scooters have invaded their streets; other times, they just want a stunt that’ll look cool on Instagram. In any case, scooters now only last a month or two on the streets. That disposability is a problem for the climate, because it means scooter companies have to engage in more extraction of raw materials like aluminum, more shipping from China to the US, and so on. Here’s another challenge: Several cities currently have policies in place that force companies to remove scooters from public areas at night. That means a lot of scooters are being collected and transported — by car — for recharging, even when they’re still 95 percent charged. To combat these challenges, the study recommends that cities and companies make some changes, such as: Allow scooters to remain in public areas overnight, decreasing the driving burdens associated with picking up fully charged or nearly fully charged scooters Streamline the collection and redistribution process for scooters, so contractors aren’t wasting gas as they zigzag all around the city in their cars trying to find scooters Allow these contractors to “claim” certain scooters for collection to eliminate unnecessary and competitive driving Incentivize or require the use of efficient vehicles for collecting and redistributing the scooters Enact and enforce anti-vandalism policies to reduce scooter damage, which can result in short lifetimes for the vehicles and thus high materials and manufacturing burdens If companies and cities make such changes, scooters have a hope of living up to their climate-friendly branding. And they can really become, as Umair Irfan wrote for Vox, “great news for urban transportation.” But until we change the way scooters are deployed, the authors of the study say, “claims of environmental benefits from their use should be met with skepticism.” Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

"E-Scooters Are Not as Green as People Think, Research Says",The Weather Channel,,National,2019,8,9,"E-Scooters Are Not as Green as People Think, Research Says. At a Glance Cities tout e-scooters as having little to no carbon footprint. New research, however, says there are greener ways to explore a city. Cities across the country have made electric scooters available for rent to residents and visitors alike, but new research says those e-scooters may not be as good for the environment as people think. While e-scooters may be greener than gasoline-powered vehicles, there are other ways to explore a city that are much better for the planet, North Carolina University researchers concluded for a study published this week in the journal Environmental Research Letters. “E-scooter companies tout themselves as having little or no carbon footprint, which is a bold statement,” Jeremiah Johnson, author of the study and an associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State, said in a press release. “We wanted to look broadly at the environmental impacts of shared e-scooters – and how that compares to other local transportation options.” The researchers looked at emissions associated not only with daily use, but also during the production of the materials and components that go into each scooter, the manufacturing process, the emissions used in shipping the scooter from the manufacturer to its city of use, as well as the environmental impact involved in collecting, charging and redistributing the scooters within each city. They also took into account user behavior. From the results of a survey, the researchers found that if e-scooters were unavailable for an outing, 49 percent of people surveyed said they would have walked or biked, 34 percent said they would have used either their own car or a service like Uber or Lyft, 11 percent said they would use public transportation and 7 percent said they would never have taken the outing at all. (MORE: Abundant Marine Bacteria Could Speed up Global Warming, Study Says) Other factors were also considered, including the complete carbon footprint of other modes of transportation and four types of environmental impacts associated with all modes of transportation: climate change, nutrient loading in water, respiratory health impacts related to air pollution and acidification. “A lot of what we found is pretty complicated, but a few things were clear,” said Johnson. “Biking –— even with an electric bike — is almost always more environmentally friendly than using a shared e-scooter. The sole possible exception is for people who use pay-to-ride bike-share programs. Those companies use cars and trucks to redistribute the bicycles in their service area, which can sometimes make them less environmentally friendly than using an e-scooter.” The study noted that while busses with high ridership are typically greener than an e-scooter, there are other options that are greener: electric mopeds and bicycles, a regular bike and walking. “We found that the environmental impact from the electricity used to charge the e-scooters is fairly small — about 5 percent of its overall impact,” Johnson says. “The real impact comes largely from two areas: using other vehicles to collect and redistribute the scooters, and emissions related to producing the materials and components that go into each scooter.”",https://weather.com/news/news/2019-08-09-escooters-rent-cities-green-environment
Scooter Brand Prix Revs Up in Race to Stay on Streets of Paris,Wall Street Journal,,National,2019,8,13,"Scooter Brand Prix Revs Up in Race to Stay on Streets of Paris. Lime, Bird, competitors vie for city approval with ad campaigns, hiring shifts, efforts to yank vehicles from bottom of Seine. The fight to be an official provider of electric scooters in Paris is driving firms to dredge discarded vehicles from the River Seine, run apologetic ad campaigns, redesign their models and reshape their workforces. This fall, Paris plans to award operating licenses to no more than three scooter companies and ban the rest. The chance to operate with limited competition in one of Europe’s most densely populated cities has pushed Lime, Bird Rides Inc. and other scooter services to show city officials they are taking a hands-on approach in a laissez-faire business. The companies let people use smartphones to rent scooters by the minute and discard them when they are done, which has resulted in cities around the world littered with abandoned scooters. Vandalism, road accidents and thefts of the vehicles have led to restrictions in San Francisco, Nashville and other major U.S. cities. In London, officials were debating whether to allow scooters when a YouTube star was killed last month in a crash. Paris “will demand that every operator follow social and environmental rules,” said Deputy Mayor for Transportation Christophe Najdovski. More than 1,200 scooters have been impounded, and the city now monitors the location of all scooters in real time, barring their use on sidewalks and banning riders from doubling up on one scooter. For scooter companies, the fear of expulsion from Paris is outweighing the cost of hiring employees to collect the vehicles. The French capital’s compact layout makes it more cost-effective to deploy staff to distribute and maintain the scooters, which appeal to tourists scooting between landmarks and to commuters who don’t drive to work. Uber Technologies Inc. -owned Jump, a scooter and bicycle provider, says 73% of users are locals. Lime says it has garnered more than a million riders since it launched in Paris last year. In 2018, individual riders logged more miles in Paris than any other city where Lime operates, according to the company. At Le Meurice hotel, concierge Bertrand Kerzreho sees the scooters whiz down Rue de Rivoli and worries about guests’ safety. “People don’t respect the rules,” he said. B-Mobility, co-founded by Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, has redesigned its scooters to make them heavier, with less foot space, to prevent horseplay. “It’s not a scooter you would buy in a toy store,” said Anne-Sophie Frenove, B-Mobility’s Vice President Europe. Operators have donated equipment and sent volunteers to work with Guppy, an environmental organization that in one day of work in June dredged more than 50 scooters from the depths of the Seine. The practice of fishing for scooters has become so common that Guppy now receives angry calls about piles of muddy scooters and bicycles abandoned on the riverbank by amateur divers. Bird is rolling out new scooters with thicker wheels and tougher frames better suited for Parisian cobblestones. The company also plans to create a European hub in Paris within the next few years, hiring 1,000 employees, said Kenneth Schlenker, the firm’s managing director in France. “At the scale we’re at in Paris, specifically, the full-time employment model makes a lot of sense,” Mr. Schlenker said. Lime kicked off a charm offensive by running ads on hundreds of billboards across the city, acknowledging the public’s exasperation. “Sh*tty scooters,” one billboard reads in French. The company has hired teams to rove the city, moving illegally parked scooters and instructing users on how to ride safely. Lime also is reconsidering its labor strategy, a spokeswoman said, shifting the criteria for who can work as “juicers,” the company’s term for the freelancers who collect and recharge scooters for a fee—often by stacking them precariously and riding off. That flexible workforce underpins the business model of many scooter companies, allowing them to expand globally without accumulating overhead. “This is a very intensive, very difficult business, and unless you have a lot of fleet on the ground, a lot of rides, a lot of riders giving you feedback, a lot of governments who you work closely with, it’s very hard,” said David Spielfogel, Lime’s policy director. Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft Inc. also rely on gig workers while spending heavily on customer acquisition to achieve scale. But some scooter operators say any resemblance with such car services is superficial, and a handful have avoided freelancers for reasons unique to their business. For example, while Uber drivers often own their cars, motivating them to look after the vehicles, juicers are typically encouraged to collect and charge as many scooters as possible, sometimes leading to mishandling. Amsterdam-based startup Dott hired 80 workers in Paris with collectively bargained benefits, and says it sees its staff as a team of “asset managers or fleet operators” rather than “a marketplace, putting individuals in relation with assets,” according to Nicolas Gorse, Dott’s general manager in France. The company says it is focused on squeezing value out of its fleet, not expanding to new markets. “We were not looking for a scalable model that lets you do 150 cities in a matter of months,” Mr. Gorse said. Berlin-based Tier Mobility, which operates in Paris, says it eschews juicers because they cause more wear and tear on scooters. By deploying its own maintenance crews and checking scooters nightly at refurbishment sites, Tier says it has cut the rate of depreciation for its latest model to €1.25 a day. Tier estimates that rate would rise to €15 a day if the company relied on juicers like some of its competitors. “It’s more economically viable, and it’s more sustainable for us to run the operations and keep control over our fleet,” said Alexandre Souter, who runs Tier’s French operations. One German scooter company operating in Paris changed its name this summer from Flash to Circ to distance itself from its roots as a startup. Circ is pitching itself to Paris officials as a bespoke operation that tailors its services to large cities like Marseille and Bordeaux as well as quaint French towns Carry-le-Rouet and Sausset-les-Pins. “Flash, it’s cool. But it also means quick, scale-up, this kind of thing, and we don’t stand for that,” said Stéphane Mac Millan, general director of Circ France.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/scooter-brand-prix-revs-up-in-race-to-stay-on-streets-of-paris-11565691638
E-scooter craze has European cities scrambling for new safety laws,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2019,8,14,"E-scooter craze has European cities scrambling for new safety laws. Authorities consider new speed limits, helmet rules as the number of injuries grows. Ban them? Issue speeding tickets? Make users take a driving test? European cities are searching for solutions to the two-wheeled phenomenon that’s fast transforming cityscapes worldwide: Electric scooters. Fans call them a leap into the future, a thrilling, app-based way to zip from the Louvre to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, without generating planet-choking pollution. Rubbish, say critics, noting growing numbers of injuries and even deaths involving e-scooters. They call them a new nuisance to pedestrians, cyclists and drivers who are already battling for the limited space on city streets. Across the United States, cities are also struggling to make rules for companies renting the vehicles and keep riders safe. Here’s what some European countries are doing about it: France Paris has more free-floating scooter companies than the entire United States, according to a June study, and at least 20,000 whizzing through its historic streets. Most are app-based, rented scooters that you pick up and drop off wherever you want, and that’s especially appealing to tourists and teens. But victims’ groups say these users don’t know French road rules and can’t always be held responsible for accidents. One scooter driver has been killed in Paris, and dozens were injured this year. Paris imposes $150 fines for riding scooters on the sidewalk. Mayor Anne Hidalgo wants to limit scooter speeds 12 miles per hour in most areas, and 5 miles per hour in areas with heavy foot traffic. She also plans to limit the number of scooters and scooter operators. France’s government is preparing new rules for the entire country. Critics say the proposals don’t go far enough. Some want age limits for riders and to require them to take driving tests and have insurance, so that governments don’t have to pay for medical care or other damage they cause. Germany Berlin legalized electric scooters two months ago and quickly realized it needs tougher rules. Last week, city officials in the German capital announced plans for on-street parking zones for the battery-powered vehicles, which are often left on sidewalks. Berlin police will also step up patrols to prevent illegal behavior such as “doubling,” or two people on one scooter. German police say seven people have been seriously injured and 27 suffered minor injuries in scooter accidents since mid-June. Britain E-scooters are banned from sidewalks, and it is illegal to use them on roads because they don’t follow laws requiring insurance, taxes and driver training. Scooter fans have protested, arguing that it’s time for laws to change. YouTube personality Emily Hartridge, 35, became the first person in Britain to be killed while riding an e-scooter when she was struck by a truck in south London on July 12. The next day, a 14-year-old boy suffered a head injury after crashing into a bus stop in southeast London. Italy Italy’s transportation ministry set new rules last month for e-scooters, Segways, hoverboards and other electric forms of transport. Scooters are allowed in streets — but can’t go faster than 18 miles per hour. In pedestrian areas, e-scooter speeds are limited to just 3.6 miles per hour. Now it’s up to Italian cities to designate areas and post signs, and establish rules for scooter-sharing businesses.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/e-scooter-craze-has-european-cities-scrambling-for-new-safety-laws/2019/08/14/c62442b8-bdda-11e9-9b73-fd3c65ef8f9c_story.html
"Skip’s new scooter has a sturdier deck, bigger wheels, and a swappable battery",The Verge,Vox,National,2019,8,14,"Skip’s new scooter has a sturdier deck, bigger wheels, and a swappable battery. In pursuit of a scooter that doesn’t break down. On Wednesday, Skip unveiled a new scooter model that’s “purpose built” for heavy fleet use. It’s the latest sign that the dockless scooter industry is intent on shoring up its losses by introducing more rugged vehicles that are safer to ride and last long enough to recoup their cost. The original scooters deployed by companies like Skip, Bird, and Lime — mostly sourced from Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Segway-Ninebot — weren’t built for shared use, so they were prone to breakdowns, often within weeks of being rolled out. As they struggle to keep afloat, the startups have each rededicated themselves to building a better scooter. Bird and Lime each rolled out new vehicles they claim can last months in the field. Skip is one of two companies authorized to operate in San Francisco as well as Washington, DC, San Diego, and Austin. In an interview, the company’s CEO, Sanjay Dastoor, said that the new S3 scooter’s modular design allows for easy repairs as well as reductions on wasted parts. “We end up throwing away less of the vehicle when something is damaged by wear and tear, or vandalized,” he said. “So the vehicle can last much longer.” Dastoor couldn’t predict the length of the new scooter’s lifespan — a key metric in scooter unit economics — but he claimed that the S3 would prove its sturdiness in the field. “We’ve already seen a huge improvement in sustainability over the industry standard with the current model we have,” he said. “And this is going to take that to another level.” The S3’s handlebars are much thicker than previous models, measuring about 24 inches and encased in a hard blue plastic. The deck is wider, and the 615Wh lithium-ion battery is swappable, meaning Skip’s team of freelance chargers can just replace it with a fully charged battery rather than move the entire scooter every night. Dastoor said he envisions people using electric bikes to transverse the city, swapping scooter batteries, rather than vans or trucks — which would have the added benefit in reducing the carbon footprint of Skip’s overall service. Dastoor said the new scooter is more stable to ride than previous models, which should improve safety for riders. The scooter’s internal sensors monitor the battery as well as the functionality of other components, and they can quickly identify problems when they arise and upload that information to Skip’s servers. The need to identify a malfunctioning battery arose for Skip earlier this year when one of its scooters in Washington, DC caught fire. The company grounded its fleet in both San Francisco and DC as it investigated the issue, and it only recently resumed operations. Meanwhile, the scooter industry is getting smaller. Scoot, the other company authorized to operate in San Francisco, was recently acquired by Bird. The city had previously declined to award Bird a permit to operate scooters, but the acquisition of Scoot allowed Bird to sidestep that obstacle. Dastoor said Skip plans to stay independent, even as many experts predict that money woes will force smaller scooter companies out of business. “If the hardware and the operating system works, well, these vehicles can be quite profitable,” he said.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805309/skip-scooter-new-model-swappable-battery-safety
Cyclists and E-Scooters Are Clashing in the Battle for Europe's Streets,Time,,National,2019,8,27,"Cyclists and E-Scooters Are Clashing in the Battle for Europe's Streets. It was five o’clock on a recent Monday afternoon, and at one of the busiest connectors between the city’s center and its surrounding neighborhoods, rush hour was in full swing. Hundreds of vehicles flowed across Dronning Louise’s bridge every minute, but this being Copenhagen, the vast majority of them–some 48,000 by day’s end– were bicycles, not cars. Among the surging tide of cargo bikes, fixies, and plain, old-fashioned two-wheelers, two tourists stood upright on e-scooters, their uncertain weaving prompting a few angry chimes from passing bike bells. From the sidewalk, Marie Djernes, a 24-year-old student who was standing next to her own bike as she waited for a friend, watched the scene with bemusement. “Yeah, they’re a bit annoying,” she said. “They don’t really seem to know what they’re doing.” Bird, Lime, Circ, Tier, Dott, Voi, Volo, Scoot, Trotti, Poppi: since making their first appearance in California in 2017, electric scooters with names that sound like modern-day versions of Snow White’s dwarves have popped up in over 100 cities worldwide, the progeny of companies aiming to become the next Uber of alternative transport (that includes Uber itself, which, despite having recently posted $5.2 billion in losses, has its own line of e-scooters, Jump). Yet for all its success, this new form of “micromobility,” as its promoters love to call it, has also brought a slew of problems, from safety risks to impassable sidewalks. The solution, say many scooter advocates in the U.S. and Europe, lies in creating the kind of infrastructure—wide bike lanes, ample parking— found in cycling-friendly cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam. But as those cities are themselves learning, e-scooters and bikes don’t necessarily play well together either. It’s not hard to understand the appeal of electric scooters. For a commuter arriving by train from the suburbs, already late and facing a half mile slog on foot to the office, or a tourist with only a day in a city and a lot of ground to cover, the devices present an easy solution: download the app, add credit card information, unlock one of the seeming gazillions of scooters parked nearby, and off you go. Because they are dockless, the devices can be left anywhere, and because they run on electric batteries instead of fossil fuels, they allow users to feel good about making a climate-friendly choice. And most of all, as their heavy use among the young suggests, zipping through a city on an e-scooter is just plain fun. But safety is a growing concern. Collisions with both cars and pedestrians have sent thousands of e-scooter users and their unwitting victims to hospitals; one study, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control for the city of Austin, Texas found roughly 20 injuries per 100,000 rides, with half of those considered serious. Scooters have also been implicated in deaths in Paris, London, San Diego, Singapore, and Barcelona, among other cities. On August 9, following four fatalities within three months, Atlanta banned their use at night. A few days later, a French organization representing 60 or so citizens injured in e-scooter collisions announced plans to sue the Paris authorities for negligence in protecting pedestrians. With an estimated 20,000 trotinettes on its streets–many of them ridden on sidewalks, abandoned in heaps in city squares, or tossed into the Seine–it’s no wonder that Paris’s situation was described as “anarchy” earlier this summer by its once e-scooter friendly mayor Anne Hidalgo. But with regulations varying from country to country, and even city to city, and with an ever growing number of companies placing as many devices as they can in as many cities as possible (Madrid alone has authorized 18 different operators) in an attempt to achieve market dominance, the chaos–and the risks–seem to be growing. At least one solution to this Wild West situation is better infrastructure, say advocates. In a safety report it released in April, the California-based e-scooter company Bird, with a presence in over 100 cities from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv, noted that it sends helmets to users who request them, but called on the cities themselves to “design for safety.” Bike lanes and similar infrastructure investments, the report stated, “effectively reduce crash risk for all road users.” Maxim Romain, the CEO and co-founder of the Amsterdam-based e-scooter company Dott, agrees. “We work closely with the municipality to invest in infrastructure,” he says of the Dutch company, which currently operates in Belgium, France, and Italy, but hopes to expand to its home country as well. “Like everybody else, at first we put ours on the sidewalk because that’s where we could [station them]. But now, we only deploy them in the parking spaces that each municipality advises. And we’re helping to open 2500 more parking spaces for shared e-scooters.” In places like San Francisco and London, pro-e-scooter groups have found common cause with cyclists. In July, a television presenter died when the electric scooter she owned collided with a truck at the same south London roundabout where a cyclist was killed in 2018. Although the vehicles are currently banned in London, the city is reviewing their status, and recently met with representatives from Bird and Lime. Rachel White, head of policy for Sustrans, a U.K. cycling advocacy group recently told The Guardian,“Generally, another group of organizations lobbying for improved cycleways can only be a good thing.” And the popularity of the devices–as well as their risks–can alter infrastructure in a way that bikes never have: on Sunday, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms promised in an editorial for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the city would put temporary barriers and painted lanes in place to separate e-scooters and bikes from automobile traffic. Yet some cities with that kind of infrastructure already in place are discovering that a strong cycling culture isn’t necessarily compatible with shared e-scooters either. In Copenhagen, for example, where half of all trips to work or school are made by bike, the reception has been decidedly mixed. “Egypt had 10 plagues. Copenhagen has only one,” complained Berlingske newspaper’s culture editor Anne Sophie Hermansen, in reference to e-scooters which, she wrote “tyrannize traffic” and “look ridiculous.” On Twitter, the hashtag #løbehjulsgate–or ‘e-scootergate,’ has been popping up all summer to refer to the controversy the devices have generated. Some of the resentment stems from the scooter company’s appropriation of the city’s public furniture. “As a cyclist in Copenhagen you feel taken into consideration, that the city has built a proper space for you,” says Klaus Bondam, director of the Danish Cyclists Federation. “There’s a democratic sense that has been built into the urban streetscape over several generations. That’s basically being disrupted at the moment; [e-scooters] don’t fit into our democratic model of how we use the urban space.” And that space can get crowded. “We have one of the largest cycling capacities anywhere,” says Mikkel Halby Mindegaard, head of the Streetlife Division for the city of Copenhagen. “But we’re seeing congestion on some streets from e-scooters. And we don’t have sufficient parking infrastructure even for bikes. The scooters add a lot on top of that.” In Münster, Germany, where bikes outnumber citizens 2 to 1, the municipal government has thus far limited the pressure on infrastructure through regulation and careful selection. Shared e-scooters were first allowed onto streets on July 27–but only 200 of them. After a trial period, that number will double, but all of them will be provided by the Berlin-based company Tier, which collects their entire fleet each night, and puts it out again in the morning–a measure that ensures the scooters are not left randomly parked in thoroughfares or heaped on sidewalks. “We had a lot of problems with share bikes before,” says traffic planner Andreas Pott, “We learned from that.” Bike-friendly Amsterdam has taken a different tack. The Dutch city has over 400 miles of cycle paths and bike lanes, but with nearly half the population traveling by bicycle each day, some of those pathways have become dangerously crowded. Even before the advent of e-scooters, a 2016 report from the Institute for Road Safety Research found that bottlenecks along the busiest paths were already increasing the number of crashes. In an attempt to ease the pressure, the Dutch government recently forced mopeds, previously allowed in bike paths, into the road with cars. E-scooters, however, fall under earlier legislation, originally drafted for Segways, that requires motorized vehicles to come equipped with air tires and double brakes, before they can be certified for public use in bike lanes. Thus far, no manufacturer has met the requirements. Even if they do, it’s not clear the Dutch will take to them. “I don’t think Amsterdam is very interested in changing the current situation,” says Maud de Vries, cofounder and managing director of BYCS, an Amsterdam-based organization that promotes cycling. “There’s not enough space for bikes as it is. And with their speed difference, the accidents, and the environmental impact, a lot of people just don’t see the advantages of them.” Closer scrutiny has called into question some of the e-scooter’s self-branding as a green transportation solution. For one thing, they don’t last very long. Because of their lightweight design and the heavy usage to which they are subjected, Bird and Lime scooters in Louisville and Indianapolis last a mere 28 days on average, with only a handful making it past the two-month mark. Even the hardiest claims — CEO Romain, for example, says Dott’s scooters average just one year — pale in comparison to the average bike’s life cycle. If their disposability casts doubt on e-scooters’ environmental credentials, so too does their carbon footprint. A life-cycle impact study (which includes an assessment not only of carbon emitted while the device is in use, but also that released by manufacturing, transporting, and charging the vehicles and their batteries), conducted by scientists at North Carolina State University and published earlier this month in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that although e-scooters had less than half the total emissions of cars (202 grams of carbon dioxide per mile traveled for the former vs. 414 grams for the latter), their output was still dramatically higher than that of bicycles,whose life-cycle emissions only average 8 grams per mile. And while e-scooters do indeed offer an attractive alternative to automobiles (34% of riders surveyed said they would have made the trip by car had the devices not been available), the same study, conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina, shows that with an even higher percentage–49%–would have walked or biked. Those proportions roughly coincide with findings from Portland, Oregon’s bureau of transportation, which, in its own 2018 study, concluded that 45% of e-scooter rides would have been been made on foot or by bike. “Of course, moving people away from cars is a positive thing,” says Mindegaard. “But we have no hard evidence that e-scooters are doing that. We don’t have numbers yet on where the customers are coming from, but we know that tourists use them a lot, and young people. So it seems like [e-scooter riders] are probably coming from people who would have walked or biked than from people in cars.” Technically, e-scooters are currently illegal in Denmark, because national law requires any object placed in public space for commercial purposes to be licensed and no company has received a permit yet. But Lime, Voi, Tier and many others “moved into the streets before we got them through the permit process,” says Mindegaard, “It all happened so fast, and they grew so quickly that we didn’t see it coming.” The city of Copenhagen is currently conducting a pilot program that will grant permits for 200 e-scooters stationed in the historic city center, and another 3000 in the outlying neighborhoods. But in the meantime, many companies are blithely operating anyway because the legal requirements for enforcing the ban are complicated enough that police, who, according to Mindegaard, cite limited resources, don’t ticket them. They do, however, go after drunk e-scooter riders. After a report came out noting that since January, over 100 people had sustained injuries from e-scooters severe enough to send them to the region’s hospitals, Copenhagen police began ticketing users found riding under the influence. But safety remains a concern, as does the broader impact on health. In the greater Copenhagen area, where the number of sick days is reduced by one for every 745 miles cycled, there is concern among cycling advocacy groups like the Danish Cycling Federation that switching to passive e-scooters will result in more obesity and related diseases. All of those concerns–health, safety, the imposition on public infrastructure—are on activist Yael Bassan’s mind every day when she moves the e-scooters that inevitably crowd the area around her shop–and posts images to social media of herself doing it. But as the owner of Copenhagen Bicycles, she has an added worry: economic survival. Located in the picturesque neighborhood of Nyhavn, one of the city’s most popular tourist destinations, her bike rental business is losing what she estimates to be 5-10% a year to e-scooters, a decline that began last year. “Every scooter that takes one of my customers is 100 kroners I don’t get,” she says. “If there are 30 of those a day, that’s 3000 kroner a day, 30,000 a month, a quarter million in half a year.” There are roughly 300 bike shops in Copenhagen, and most of them also supply rentals; anecdotal information from a few owners confirms that they too are seeing revenues fall. But what is especially galling, Bassan says, is to lose money to companies so actively flouting the law. “I applied to get permission to put my bikes in the square in front of my shop, and was told it wasn’t possible,” she says. “If I put my bikes there, I’ll get a fine. But every day, there are 20 or more scooters parked there, trying to take my customers, and no one does anything. That’s why I started getting angry.” Since she started posting videos and photos of herself moving the scooters on Twitter, she’s gotten a lot of support from other Copenhageners tired, she says, of having to dodge the devices on sidewalks and in bike lanes. “Disruption is supposed to be such a positive thing these days. People are afraid to be annoyed at disruption because it makes you sound old or old-fashioned. But we need to ask, do we want this disruption? Is it good for us?” At the Danish Cycling Federation, director Klaus Bondam is wondering the same thing. Although he himself feels comfortable sharing lane space with e-scooters (“We go about the same speed,” he says with a smile), he knows that isn’t the case for seniors or parents with small children. He worries that those groups will simply stop cycling, just as he worries about the impact on Copenhagen life if public space succumbs to private businesses. “We’ve built a really good bicycle culture in Denmark,” he says. “Ruining that would be a terrible thing.”",https://time.com/5659653/e-scooters-cycles-europe/
New Miami Hurricane Hazard: Dockless Scooters as Projectiles,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2019,8,29,"New Miami Hurricane Hazard: Dockless Scooters as Projectiles. Florida is facing its first major storm in the age of dockless scooters. Miami -- home to a large proportion of them -- isn’t taking any chances. The city has told all rental services to get their conveyances off the streets by Friday lest they fly perilously through the air when Dorian reaches land over the Labor Day weekend, according to Ken Russell, a municipal commissioner. The mayor’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for additional information. Bird, Lime, Lyft, Spin and Uber all promised their scooters would be battened down. The vehicles have created a bitter backlash nationwide as scooter-haters carp about them impeding sidewalks and generally littering the streetscape. Until now, though, the threat has been confined to ground level. But Dorian, with winds that may touch 130 miles per hour, may weaponize what has so far been a scourge mostly confined to aesthetics.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/miami-s-new-hurricane-hazard-dockless-scooters-as-projectiles
Study finds nearly half of serious e-scooter injuries involved alcohol,Today,,National,2019,8,29,"Study finds nearly half of serious e-scooter injuries involved alcohol. Nearly 40 percent of those tested for alcohol after e-scooter incidents had a blood-alcohol level over the legal driving limit, the study found. Alcohol has become a major factor in rising electric scooter-related injuries as the popular motorized rides proliferate across in cities across the country. A new study published Thursday in Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open found that out of 103 patients treated at three trauma centers for e-scooter-related injuries, 79% were tested for alcohol and 48% of that group was found to have a blood-alcohol level of more than 0.08, which is the legal limit for drivers in most states. It's not just alcohol that has impaired scooter users and led to injuries. Sixty percent of the 103 patients in the study were also screened for drugs, and 52% of them tested positive. Some cities have already taken action to curb alcohol use and e-scooters. A 28-year-old man was prosecuted for driving under the influence in September 2018 after he struck a pedestrian while operating a Bird scooter in Los Angeles. Experts and doctors across the country have also stressed the importance of wearing a helmet while on an e-scooter, but it doesn't appear to be reaching most riders. The new study, which involves patients who were treated between Sept. 1, 2017 and Oct. 31, 2018, found that 98 percent of those injured were not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. The increase in accidents has also prompted lawmakers to take a look at proper use of scooters. New Jersey passed a bill earlier this year that regulates scooters like bicycles, requiring helmets to be used by anyone under 17. A Rutgers University study released in June found the number of nationwide injuries involving e-scooters climbed from 2,325 in 2008 to 6,957 in 2018, and 66% of those treated were not wearing helmets. The issue of e-scooter safety was spotlighted last month when YouTube star Emily Hartridge, 35, died in a scooter accident in London after colliding with a truck. A government official met with scooter sharing companies Lime, Bird and B Mobility about informing riders that e-scooters are not legal on public roads in the UK. ""That’s why every day we’re innovating on technology, infrastructure and education to set the standard for micromobility safety,” a spokesperson for Lime told TODAY in June. “We appreciate the attention on this very important issue, and we look forward to continue working with the industry, medical community and regulators to create a meaningful ecosystem for this new and evolving technology."" In the study released Thursday, researchers from the University of California San Diego Health System, Dell Seton Medical Center in Texas, Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego and the University of California-San Diego found that 65% of those injured were male. The average age of the patients was 37.1, and more than half (51%) had ""significant injuries,"" including intracranial hemorrhage and fractures requiring surgery. Those findings echoed those of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in May that 45 percent of accident-related injuries on e-scooters were head injuries. The authors noted, however, that the sample size was fairly small and did not include patients who may have had more minor injuries and were quickly discharged or treated at an urgent care facility and not hospitalized. Cities are also trying to determine where to allow scooter use. The dockless scooters are often used in densely-populated areas where services like Uber and Lyft aren't as effective because of bumper-to-bumper traffic. The Denver City Council voted earlier this week to ban them from sidewalks in the city, only allowing riders to use the street or bike lanes, according to NBC affiliate KUSA.",https://www.today.com/health/nearly-half-serious-e-scooter-injuries-involved-alcohol-study-finds-t161564
Miami Faces A New Challenge As Hurricane Dorian Approaches: Dockless Electric Scooters,NPR,NPR,National,2019,8,30,"Miami Faces A New Challenge As Hurricane Dorian Approaches: Dockless Electric Scooters. As officials in Miami work to clear the streets of hazards in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, they face something new: dockless electric scooters, scattered all over the city. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Hurricane Dorian is hurtling toward Florida and is expected to make landfall early next week, and as so often the case with these major storms, residents and city officials are busy preparing for the worst. AILSA CHANG, HOST: Already, stores are running out of water, canned foods and gas. Today Florida Governor Ron DeSantis underscored the need to be ready. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: The one thing that's been pretty certain is that this thing's been getting stronger very consistently and completely in line with all the forecasting. CHANG: Miami officials are scrambling to get ready. MANOLO REYES: We have been cleaning the drains. We have been collecting any debris or garbage that is on the street. We have our police and fire ready. And we have ordered ice and water (ph). They are coming from upstate. CORNISH: That's Miami City Commissioner Manolo Reyes. He says this year there is an additional step the city needs to take to protect its residents. REYES: This is the first time that we have to deal with scooters when a hurricane comes to South Florida because the scooters are a pilot program in the city of Miami. CHANG: Reyes is talking about those dockless electric scooters. You've no doubt seen them in your city. They're often abandoned on sidewalks, always in the way. Well, during a hurricane, those scooters are much more than an eyesore and an irritation. REYES: They could be missiles that can hurt people or break windows. CORNISH: The city of Miami has to get them off the streets before the hurricane hits. REYES: We ordered all the companies to pick up all the scooters because, as you well know, they are always littering and left on the sidewalks. CORNISH: Those companies include Bird, Bold, Uber, Lime, Lyft and Spin. REYES: All six companies has responded that they are picking them up, and they are taking them to their warehouse. CHANG: Reyes says he expects all of the scooters to be picked up and returned to the warehouses by the end of today.

Miami orders scooters removed from streets before Hurricane Dorian turns them into projectiles,CNBC,NBC,National,2019,8,30,"Miami orders scooters removed from streets before Hurricane Dorian turns them into projectiles. Electric scooter rental companies are told by the city of Miami that they have until noon on Friday to get their scooters off the streets, lest the devices become projectiles once Hurricane Dorian hits. Six companies operate fleets in the city, including Bird, Bolt, Uber’s Jump, Lime, Lyft and Spin. Hurricane Dorian, currently a Category 2 storm, is expected to make landfall in Florida this weekend and could produce winds of up to 130 mph if it reaches Category 4. The city of Miami has notified a number of companies that they must remove their fleets of electric scooters from the streets in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, lest the devices become flying projectiles. Officials told the six companies that operate fleets in the city — Bird, Bolt, Uber’s Jump, Lime, Lyft and Spin — to clear out their scooters by noon on Friday. The order is meant to prevent any potential hazards that could arise from the scooters being left out during the storm, including fears that the vehicles could be swept up in the storm’s dangerous winds. A number of scooter companies said they’ve also removed or reduced their fleets in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa and Orlando, which are also expected to be in the path of the storm. Hurricane Dorian, currently a strong Category 2 storm, is forecast to become a Category 4 storm with potentially “devastating hurricane-force winds,” the National Hurricane Center said on Friday. The storm is expected to make landfall on Florida’s east coast this weekend, before rolling inland toward Orlando early next week. Ken Russell tweet Should Hurricane Dorian grow into a Category 4 storm, it could produce winds of more than 130 mph. No one has been evacuated yet, but officials in Miami have taken a number of steps to ensure residents’ safety, including the removal of dockless scooters. “With Hurricane Dorian threatening to impact Miami, city leaders made the decision to have the companies pick up the scooters early today and leave them out of service until further notice,” said John Heffernan, a spokesperson for the city of Miami. A Lime spokesperson said the company is pulling its scooters in Orlando, Miami and Fort Lauderdale, as well as reducing its fleet size in Tampa, which amounts to almost 1,500 scooters and 500 bicycles. “We’re in touch with each city and will comply with any request to prioritize safety,” the spokesperson said. “We’re also communicating with our riders to let them know of these steps and to encourage them to follow the guidance of their local authorities and remain safe.” Lyft spokeswoman Kaitlyn Carl said the company has paused all scooter operations in Miami and expects to meet the city’s noon deadline. Lyft’s operations team is picking up each of the 244 scooters in the city and storing them in a warehouse until the storm passes. “We will resume operations only once conditions improve and will continue to follow the guidance provided by the City of Miami,” Carl added. Uber spokesman Javi Correoso said the company has suspended Jump scooter rentals in Miami and Tampa. “Our operations team is currently removing all of the scooters in both markets so that they do not become a hazard before any storm impacts are felt,” Correoso said. “This process will be completed by noon today.” A Bird spokesperson confirmed the company is collecting and storing its scooters in Miami. A spokesperson from Spin said all scooters will be “retrieved well before the storm is expected to arrive” and that it will keep riders notified with any updates. In a statement, a Bolt spokesperson said, “In anticipation of the storm and at the direction of the Miami officials we began taking our scooters off of the streets yesterday and will have the remainder of them removed ahead of today’s noon deadline.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/hurricane-dorian-scooters-removed-from-streets-in-florida.html
Scooters are a huge problem for cities. No one knows how to solve it yet,CNN,,National,2019,8,30,"Scooters are a huge problem for cities. No one knows how to solve it yet. Stewart Goodwin tried to put a stop to the constant flow of scooters into the plaza he oversees. He spoke to the government and scooter companies, but to no avail. ""We still find scooters in our fountains,"" Goodwin, executive director of the Indiana War Memorials in Indianapolis, told CNN Business. ""We find them in the canal. We find them strewn all over the sidewalks."" In the Wild West of transportation, no one knows what to do about scooters. They appeared suddenly in many cities, triggering complaints of clutter and blocked sidewalks. When ridden, scooters emerged as sidewalk bullies — fast enough to unsettle pedestrians and create safety issues. But force scooters into the streets and they are slow and vulnerable amid two-ton vehicles, not to mention potholes that can swallow small tires. Now, governments, communities and businesses — even the scooter companies themselves — are playing catchup on finding the right rules for scooters, and how to enforce them. Debates have emerged over when and where scooters should be ridden, and if the form of scooters needs to evolve, with bigger wheels, brighter lights or even a seat. ""It's definitely a learning experience,"" said Noelle LeVeaux, executive director of Uptown Dallas, a business improvement organization that manages the neighborhood's public spaces. ""We don't have a lot of good data. So much is anecdotal, that's the biggest issue."" None of this is what was supposed to happen. The inconsistent rules of the road As urban populations swell, cities and startups have been searching for fresh transportation solutions. Scooters are an obvious mode for experimentation: They offer an affordable and quick way to make short trips in congested cities, much like bicycles, but without anyone breaking a sweat. LeVeaux's group initially welcomed scooter riding on its sidewalks. They seemed like a safe place for new riders to use the scooters, LeVeaux said. But Uptown Dallas soon saw the pedestrian safety issues of sidewalk riding and flipped its position. Now it's reconsidering if scooters, which can reach speeds as fast as 15 mph, should be ridden at night. Atlanta banned nighttime riding this summer following a string of scooter deaths. Other cities have totally banned scooters, with lingering memories of how Uber stormed onto their streets and created long-lasting challenges for local governments. Scooter rules vary widely by city, and even by company. You may be able to ride to the art museum or football stadium in one city but not another. In Denver, you can park a Lyft scooter at the pro hockey or baseball stadiums, but not pro football. To park at pro football, you'll need to be on a Bird or Lime scooter. The restrictions are made by the companies, with input from governments and communities. Companies are quick to restrict sensitive or crowded areas, such as federal government buildings and large event spaces. Cities vary in their requests. Bolt, a scooter company, said Portland, Oregon, gave it a list of 400 areas to restrict. Some businesses nationwide that were contacted by CNN Business, including an art museum in Baltimore and a hospice in Raleigh, North Carolina, said they weren't even aware scooters had been blocked near them. Scooter companies enforce riding restrictions via GPS. If you go outside the bounds, your scooter may slow down and not allow you to end your ride. These restrictions impact businesses, sports stadiums, museums, even transit stops. Scooter companies sell themselves as an equitable form of transportation that connects residents to traditional public transit by addressing the ""last-mile problem."" Public transportation generally doesn't take people to their final destination, so the last leg of a trip can be slow or expensive. The companies view scooters as ideal for this final stretch. But that's not always how things have played out. Where the streets have no scooters Earlier this year, Scoot, a San Francisco-based subsidiary of Bird, restricted parking in Chinatown and the Tenderloin, a neighborhood with a significant homeless population. It said the decision resulted from narrow sidewalks, and concerns raised by the local community groups. Groups were divided over a ban. Fernando Pujals, spokesperson for the Tenderloin Community Benefit District, said he reached out to Scoot about crowded sidewalk concerns, but didn't want a ban. ""People should be given just as much access as somebody in an affluent neighborhood,"" he said. ""Our recommendation was how to bring scooters into the neighborhood in a thoughtful way that would encourage ridership."" Charlotte, North Carolina's government has tried to juggle promoting scooters as a complement to transit, while making sure scooters don't end up clogging stations full of pedestrians — or falling on tracks. It's had scooter companies use GPS to block off the stations. Some have gone further, including blocking nearby streets. Bird has even restricted parking around the city's downtown transportation center, which takes up an entire block and is adjacent to a light rail stop. Bird declined to explain the policy. In the Wild West of transportation, no one knows what to do about scooters Just because there are restrictions, doesn't mean they're actually enforced. Bird's app warns riders when they're in a no parking zone, and urges them to move out of it. But a rider can override the suggestion and still end the trip. Another limitation is GPS accuracy, which tall buildings can distort. Plus, if a scooter is moving at 15mph into a no-ride zone, the scooter may not realize and slow down until a rider is deep into a restricted area. Some organizations who have requested restrictions described the GPS technique as ineffective. Do scooters need to be regulated? One question in managing scooters is whether to treat them like bicycles or regulate them more strictly. Increasingly, distinctions are being drawn in response to more complaints and concerns about scooters than bicycles. Denver's 16th Street Mall, a pedestrian zone, welcomes bicycles on weekends, but not scooters. The Wharf, a waterfront development in Washington, DC, opened in 2017 with public spaces designed especially to welcome bicycles and pedestrians. Several roads are built without curbs, so that all forms of transportation mix on level ground, a European tactic proven to slow down cars. But then the scooters came. Monty Hoffman, CEO of Hoffman & Associates, which co-developed the Wharf, likes scooters enough to place two in his company's office for employees to ride to meetings. Scooters add to the city's ""urban theater,"" Hoffman said. But that theater has turned too dramatic, and he's asked for speed restrictions of 6 mph, and no-parking zones a the Wharf's piers. ""We embrace [scooters] and we want more, but we want it done the right way,"" Hoffman said. In classic scooter regulation form, company responses vary widely. Some have taken no action. Others have placed no-parking and no-riding bans over the entire Wharf, and nearby streets. All of these scooter problems are playing out at the same time investor interest has cooled as companies burn through millions. On top of regulatory woes, scooters aren't lasting long enough to make good business sense. Either companies find fixes that win over investors and the public, or history may remember shared scooters as a fad.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/30/tech/scooter-management/index.html
Electric scooters hit bumps in the road as they roll out across Europe,Cnet,,National,2019,9,7,"Electric scooters hit bumps in the road as they roll out across Europe. From Portugal to Paris to Poland electric scooters have invaded Europe, but it's far from a smooth ride. The searing heat in the Polish city of Wroclaw was turning one of my favorite hobbies -- walking miles on a self-designed sightseeing tour -- into a real chore. At every turn my eyes were drawn toward the clusters of electric scooters, their metal frames glinting in the sun. ""Rent me,"" they seemed to whisper furtively. ""It will be so much more comfortable than walking."" And so, as I wilted onto a shaded bench, I gave in and downloaded the Lime app. Once I'd started scooting, I realized how hard it would be to give it up. Everywhere I went that weekend, there was always a Lime scooter nearby whenever I needed one. The appearance of electric scooters on the streets of Wroclaw, Poland's fourth biggest city, is far from unique. I noticed a similar influx in Krakow, Poland, earlier this summer, in Paris in May and in Lisbon last November. Originating in the US, scooter invasions of big cities are nothing new, though in addition to Silicon Valley mainstays Bird and Lime, Europe has its own batch of competitors: Circ and Tier, both from Berlin, and Sweden's Voi. But these companies just scratch the surface of the scooter options available. When 24-year-old London-based VC firm Northzone decided to invest in an electric scooter mobility startup last year, it was spoiled for choice, General Partner Paul Murphy told me. In the end, his firm picked Tier after being convinced of the founder's commitment to environmentalism and previous experience building a company called Rebuy, which was all about giving used electronics a second life. According to Northzone's research, by far the biggest factor as to whether scooter companies can turn profitable over time (something none have managed so far) is their ability to make the scooters last as long as possible. Research published in May by Boston Consulting Group estimates most scooters have a life of around three months. A rough ride Longevity is a particular problem in Europe, where cities with ancient streets and varying levels of upkeep put scooters through their paces compared to the newer, smoother streets of California, where they first gained momentum. According to a Bloomberg report last month, Europe's cities are causing scooter companies to rethink aspects of their business models and improve the robustness of the scooters they're using. In Wroclaw, the two main hazards I encountered are features common to many European cities: cobblestones and tram lines. The only way I can describe the experience of traversing cobbles on a Lime scooter is to ask you to imagine the sensation of your brain rattling around haphazardly within your skull, sending your teeth chattering and causing your vision to blur so much as to render your eyes functionally useless. On several occasions, when sidewalks and roads were equally cobbled, I had no choice but to dismount, park and complete my journey on foot. Being new to the world of scooting, I couldn't be sure exactly what model of scooter I was using, but some of the newer ones do come equipped with bigger wheels and better suspension, which offers some semblance of damage control when on bumpy ground. According to Murphy, this'll only continue to improve as new models are developed. ""A lot of people look at scooters and think that that's kind of the end game, but it's really just the first incarnation"" he said. ""I think there's going to be lots of innovation around scooters that work well in rain, really cold climates, potentially when the roads are a bit slippery. This is really just phase one, in our mind."" Overcrowding During this first phase, everything has been in play, which has resulted in scooter companies descending into cities across the continent en masse. The worst victim of scooter invasion I've witnessed with my own eyes must be Lisbon. When I was in town for Web Summit last November, so were the CEOs of several Silicon Valley scooter companies -- and they'd brought their scooters with them. When the scooters first arrived, the city took an experimental attitude, which Murphy says was to its credit. Lisbon is a particularly hilly city, and on more than one occasion I found scooters abandoned partway up a steep incline, blocking the narrow pavement and forcing me to step into the street to circumnavigate the obstacle. With the cobbles, the hills and the tourists, the scooter situation quickly descended into chaos. It was, as Murphy described it, ""the perfect storm."" Scooter companies provide guidelines for parking the vehicles respectfully, but in reality many users don't follow the rules, which caused Lisbon to introduce fines earlier this summer. When I arrived in Berlin this week, the scooter situation seemed a tad more civilized. That's likely due to legislation Germany introduced in June, before allowing scooters to hit the country's roads and cycle paths. These included a maximum speed of 20km per hour, a lower age limit of 14 and very specific specifications for the scooters to meet. European cities have been burned before by startups such as Uber and Airbnb helicoptering into town and unleashing unforeseen havoc. Germany consistently has been one of the strictest countries regulating these companies. Murphy praised Germany's approach of deciding on the rules before opening up the market. ""It really meant everyone knew exactly what they had to do to be legal, to play,"" he said. But the rules haven't solved all the problems. According to AP, German police said last month that 38 people had been injured in scooter accidents since June. Safety last As I rolled around Wroclaw, busy pedestrianized areas made for perhaps the worst scooting in the city (after the cobbles and tram lines). People weren't yet conditioned to watch out for and move out of the way of scooters -- and I totally got it. The most instinctive human reaction when someone blunders into your path without looking where they're going is to be annoyed. I'm not immune to this, and yet when I was on a scooter, my sympathies were almost always reserved for the other party. As I wobbled perilously through the streets, my fear of accidentally hitting someone was very real. CNET has widely reported on accidents involving scooters in the US. Unsurprisingly, introducing the scooters into Europe's ancient and often narrow streets hasn't helped solve the problem that when the vehicles are traveling at speed, they pose a real risk to riders, cyclists and pedestrians. In Copenhagen, people are regularly arrested for drunk scooter driving. In Paris, where scooters are referred to as ""trottinettes,"" accidents caused by scooter collisions have caused politicians to criticize companies and call for them to be banned, or at the very least better regulated. The city already fines people for riding on sidewalks, and will soon introduce speed limits. Even Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who in trying to thin out the city's traffic has been a proponent of green alternatives, described the situation as ""not far from anarchy."" She's thinking of limiting the number of scooter operators to just three (from the current 12), and capping the number of scooters allowed in the city altogether to prevent the current 20,000 vehicles rising to an estimated 40,000 by the end of the year. Right now there's a huge question mark hanging over London, where electric scooters are currently banned (not that it stops some people from using them -- one scooter rider has already been killed in the city's traffic). The ban is a product of old laws currently being reviewed by the UK's Department for Transport, and could well be overturned to allow scooters into the British capital. If London decides to allow scooters on the road, it'll likely result in the biggest turf war between scooter companies that Europe has seen to date. With its congestion and air pollution problems, not to mention the size of the population and tourist industry, London presents a great opportunity for green transportation. But its ancient, narrow, overcrowded streets and relatively poor bicycle infrastructure also present a huge challenge. Following Berlin's example and regulating their use ahead of time would help to keep things orderly, but according to Murphy, a London resident, to make it safe the city also ""has to figure out how to get these cars off the roads."" He thinks that in the long run, as regulation comes into play, as companies invest in more advanced models and as cities continue to replace cars with new green forms of transportation, Europe's scooter problems will resolve themselves. What's more, he says that whichever companies manage to pull ahead in the continent's diverse tapestry of countries will eventually win the global market overall -- so the battle's really on. My brief flirtation with the scooting lifestyle in Poland allowed me to glimpse the good (the fun and convenience) and the bad (the discomfort, the messiness, the many perils) of electric scooters. I came away with the sense that scooters in Europe still have a long way to go until they overwhelmingly solve more problems than they create. Companies deploying them have a long, bumpy and oftentimes cobbled road ahead.",https://www.cnet.com/news/electric-scooters-hit-bumps-in-the-road-as-they-rollout-across-europe/
"E-scooter injuries rising, often involve drugs or alcohol",Reuters,,National,2019,9,13,"E-scooter injuries rising, often involve drugs or alcohol. As the popularity of electric scooters increases, so do injuries sending users to the hospital, a U.S. study suggests. Those injured riders are most often young men, without helmets, drunk or stoned, researchers found. The analysis was done at three southern California trauma centers. The authors found that since introduction of the devices in 2017 as shared rental transportation, injury rates have been climbing. The top injury types were broken bones in the body or the face, followed by bleeding in the head. Most of the injured were young men, and among those tested for drug or alcohol intoxication, half came back positive, the study team reports in the journal Trauma Surgery and Acute Care Open. “Anyone who lives in a major city knows the adoption of these new devices is significant,” Dr. Leslie Kobayashi of the University of California, San Diego, said in a phone interview. To assess the number and nature of injuries related electronic scooters, also called eScooters, Kobayashi and colleagues looked at data on 103 patients admitted San Diego area hospitals with injuries related to eScooter use from September 2017 through October 2018. The research team found that monthly admissions increased over time, peaking at 43 patients seen in October 2018. Most patients were men between ages 20 and 40, with an average age of 37. About 98% hadn’t been wearing a helmet. About four in five patients were tested for blood alcohol levels, and nearly half of these patients were found to be intoxicated. Of the 60% given a urine toxicology test, just over half were found to have drugs in their system, most commonly THC, methamphetamine and other amphetamines. The most common injuries were fractures in legs, ankles or forearms, followed by facial fractures, intracranial hemorrhages and concussions. About a third of patients required surgery. The average hospital stay was three days. Eight patients required ICU admission, and six patients were transferred to long-term acute care. No patients died. “We were surprised by the number of patients who were intoxicated with alcohol or illicit mind-altering substances,” she said. “After a night out isn’t the best time” to use these devices, she added. A limitation of the study is that the data came from Level I trauma centers, meaning they reflect the most severe injuries. A follow-up study is looking at emergency department and urgent care cases around San Diego that don’t lead to hospitalization, such as lacerations or fractures that can be fixed quickly, Kobayashi noted. Her teams is also planning a broader study to observe trends around the country. “If you look at the trend toward an increasing number of injuries through October 2018 and map it out toward today, we’re seeing more and more injuries. It’s a real-time issue we’re trying to get a handle on,” said Dr. Kate Douglass, director of the George Washington University Center for Injury Prevention and Control in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the study. Local factors in different cities, such as high-traffic areas and new motorized device regulations, lead to different trends in injuries, Douglass said. Some areas allow people to ride them on the sidewalk, but others require users to ride scooters on the street. Different limitations around when, where and how the scooters can be used, also affect what types of injuries occur. It’s important for users to know how to ride the devices before taking them on public roads, Douglass added. “We often see people who hit potholes or curbs and end up fracturing their arm or elbow because they fall,” she said in a phone interview. “Use a safety check and practice your brakes and turns. Make sure you know how to use it before you operate it.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-scooters-injuries-idUSKCN1VY1WQ
Uber To Pull Jump Bikes From Atlanta And San Diego,NPR,NPR,National,2019,9,13,"Uber To Pull Jump Bikes From Atlanta And San Diego. Uber's bright red Jump bikes will no longer be seen on the streets of San Diego and Atlanta. The company has confirmed it will soon pull its ride-share bikes from those two cities. Over the summer, both San Diego and Atlanta ratcheted up regulations on shareable bikes and electric scooters. The company's bikes are also temporarily unavailable in Providence, R.I., according to Uber spokesman Matthew Wing. The company also stopped bike-sharing in Dallas and San Antonio earlier this summer, after announcing it would close down in Staten Island, N.Y. The move comes at a tough time for Uber. The company laid off more than 400 workers earlier this week, as the ride-hailing company continues to struggle financially. At the same time, there have been clashes in many communities over shareable electric scooters and bikes from companies like Uber, Bird and Lime. Neighborhood advocates say the bikes and scooters clutter cities and cause public safety concerns. Some communities have banned the use of these scooters and bikes at night. Uber's Wing cited regulatory costs as part of the decision to end operations in San Diego. San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Bry had called for a temporary ban on electric scooters until a plan to protect public and environmental safety was developed. Uber will also pull electric scooters from San Diego as of Sept. 19, although their scooters will remain in Atlanta. The spokesman said Uber plans to work with the city to create ""sensible"" regulations. He said the company looks forward to returning to San Diego in the future. One way to regulate scooters and bikes could be to limit companies from growing their fleets until they can show the vehicles are being used multiple times a day, rather than clogging the streets, Wing said. Bike and scooter sharing has also made waves in Atlanta. Wing did not specify why bikes were being pulled from Atlanta, but the city has placed more regulations on them. In August, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms banned the use of dockless bikes and scooters at night, according to a press release. ""Sadly, we have seen a pattern in the recent and tragic fatalities involving scooters – they all occurred after sunset,"" Bottoms said in the release. ""This nighttime ban, while we continue to develop further long-term measures, will ensure the safest street conditions for scooter riders, motorists, cyclists, those in wheelchairs and pedestrians."" In Providence, Uber's Jump bikes have been temporarily removed because the bikes were being vandalized, Wing said. ""We remain committed to operating in Providence and plan to work with the city on a solution that will hopefully allow us to return some bikes this fall,"" Wing said.",https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760564667/uber-to-pull-jump-bikes-from-two-cities

Why Boulder Blocked Electric Scooters,City Lab,Bloomberg,National,2019,9,13,"Why Boulder Blocked Electric Scooters. The famously bike-friendly Colorado city has some of the best cycling infrastructure in North America. But electric scooters still aren’t welcome to use it. When micro-mobility companies dumped hundreds of scooters and e-bikes in cities around the country seemingly overnight, city officials in Boulder, Colorado, watched warily, expecting their famously bike-friendly city to be a target. In nearby Denver, for example, city officials swiftly ordered Lime and Bird scooters off the streets after hundreds of the tiny shared vehicles showed up last year. Then they crafted a series of regulations determining where and how the scooters could be used, parked, and collected. “The experience from the other cities where companies just dumped e-scooters overnight—we didn’t want to be faced with that dilemma,” said Dave “DK” Kemp, Boulder’s senior transportation planner. “We’ve seen the horror stories, and we’ve seen the success stories too.” So when the state passed legislation in May, 2019 that gave e-scooters permission to ride on the streets (removing them from the “toy vehicle” category), Kemp and others in Boulder leaped into action. Although commercial scooters weren’t yet operating in the city, the city council passed an emergency ordinance the same day that banned the issuance of commercial scooter permits within city limits. Over the next several months, the city will host a series of public forums to determine how, and if, commercial scooter-sharing should be allowed. “To do it right, you really have to make sure your community is on board to be able to address potential problems,” Kemp said. “Because we know there are some.” A slew of scooter companies have all expressed interest in entering Boulder. And no wonder—this is one of the bike-friendliest cities in North America. Within and immediately surrounding the city are more than 300 miles of bikeway, including 96 miles of bike lanes, 84 miles of multiuse paths, and 50 miles of designated bike routes. Within the city itself, on-street bike lanes, contra-flow bike lanes, designated bike routes, paved shoulders, multi-use paths and soft-surface paths all make up one of the most comprehensive urban bike networks in the U.S. “We’ve been working with a number of e-bikes and scooter companies,” Mary Ann Mahoney, the CEO of the Boulder Convention and Visitors’ Bureau, told CityLab. “We have a (dockless e-bike) pilot starting in the fall, to see how it’ll work.” But Boulder has been notably slow to embrace the charms of e-scooters. The resistance might look incongruous, given the outdoorsy Colorado town’s enthusiasm for other two-wheeled conveyances. But the region’s large and influential cyclist community has been less-than-enthusiastic about welcoming battery-powered interlopers: Legislation that gives scooters the same rights as bicycles is something that cycling advocates here say should be approached carefully, from a policy standpoint. “I think the scooter industry, this year was their year to update definitions of vehicle codes related to their products. In other words, there’s really no legal standing for electric scooters, so they basically went state by state—30 to 35 different states—where they updated the definition of an electric scooter so that they basically have the same rights to the road as a bicycle,” Morgan Lommele, director of state and local policy for the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association and the People For Bikes Coalition, which is based in Boulder but didn’t work on the Boulder bill. “What that really means is, e-scooters, unless banned from infrastructure, would be allowed wherever bikes would be allowed.” “There are a lot of old-guard Boulderites who want Boulder the way it used to be, and that did not include scooters.” In the broader conversation of mobility, the general camps are often divided between private cars and everything else. But in Boulder, lines are often drawn between people-powered modes, like walking and cycling, and motorized ones, which includes not only cars but also e-bikes and e-scooters. “There are two ways to think about it,” Lommele said. “One way is human-powered, active mobility: so bicycles, walking, running, and even pedal-powered e-bikes. That would exclude electric scooters, because if you’ve been on one, you know you’re not really moving your body and getting exercise. The other way to look at it is ‘anything but a car’—any micromobility to get around, or any alternative transit, which would encompass buses, e-scooters, and bikes.” In many cities, scooters are currently operating in something of a grey zone—often tolerated on sidewalks among pedestrians, as well as in bike lanes with traditional pedal bicycles. “The bike industry in general is kind of opposed to this blanket idea that scooters would be allowed wherever bikes would be allowed,” Lommele said. “Our position is, it needs to be a little more thoughtful than that.” In places like Boulder, with its extensive network of on- and off-street bike trails that are heavily used by avid cyclists, adding motorized scooters to the mix might be problematic. “For a city that has the best bike infrastructure for transportation and recreation in the country, I think they’re really, really cautious about the scooters, because there are a lot of old-guard Boulderites who want Boulder the way it used to be, and that did not include scooters,” Lommele said. “They’re worried about the safety implications, and I think that’s a valid conversation to have.” In Boulder, environmental concerns are also on par with issues of safety, planning, and permissions. While scooter companies often claim that their service offers a more greener alternative to driving, recent studies on their environmental impact are mixed. Not only are the vehicles themselves notably short-lived, thanks to vandalism, but in cities like Denver they’re driven around and collected each night, possibly offsetting claims of saved vehicle emissions. “The general environmental concern here is much higher than in other places, and I can see some benefits of not having scooters everywhere,” Eric Budd, a local cyclist and board member of Boulder Progressives, which advocates for housing, transportation and climate initiatives, told CityLab. “The idea of these things on publicly owned land is anathema. We have a clean and well-managed city, and people don’t want to see scooters defacing public space and to have companies making a profit off of it.” If 2018 was the year the scooter companies simply unleashed their products onto the streets of cities, unbidden, 2019 is the year that cities struck back with regulations that sought to bring scooters back under control. Cities like Nashville and Atlanta have banned commercial scooter-sharing services after complaints; other major potential markets, such as Boston, Seattle, and New York City, have never allowed them. And many others are closely monitoring pilot programs. Denver’s Dockless Mobility Pilot Permit Program was set to expire in July, but was recently extended. In the meanwhile, to align more closely with state law, the Denver Department of Public Works recommended to Denver City Council that based on observed rider behavior and resident feedback, electric scooters should be prohibited on sidewalks. “With the change approved in late August,” a Denver DPW statement said, “people on scooters now follow the same rules as people on bikes and electric bikes and should ride in the street and in bike lanes.” It’s difficult to say whether scooters will eventually find their way to Boulder when the moratorium expires. “It depends on whether electric scooters are a trend or here to stay,” Lommele said. “If they’re a trend, [scooter companies] might just drop Boulder as a priority area. If they’re here to stay, I bet Boulder will try to find a way for people to ride them on city bike paths.” For now, the city is content to sit out the micromobility revolution. Kemp says that the community forums on scooters will allow the city to be deliberate in the nuances of adopting the new devices. “So often, innovation is about ‘let’s try it and see,’” he said. “And I look at innovation as being proactive and ‘let’s do this right.’” Others aren’t convinced time will solve this debate. “If I had to bet, given the current state of Scooterville,” Budd said, “in a year from now, we still won’t have scooters.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-13/bike-friendly-boulder-isn-t-high-on-scooters
Nashville Mayor Proposed E-Scooter Ban; Then Council Changed The Rules,Forbes,,National,2019,9,16,"Nashville Mayor Proposed E-Scooter Ban; Then Council Changed The Rules. For anyone who doubted electric scooters are here to stay, consider what happened this past summer in Nashville. In June Mayor David Briley proposed banning the scooters after Brady Gaulke, a 26-year-old man, died following a late-night collision with an SUV. By the third week of August, however, the city’s Metro Council voted 29-1 to allow the “shared urban mobility devices” to return to Music City’s downtown streets. Bird and Lime, the two largest scooter companies in the U.S., lobbied aggressively for the legislation. Nashville’s approach underscores the evolution of e-scooters from brash transportation disruptors to a more responsible alternative designed to safely reduce vehicular congestion in city centers. There are new rules that, among other steps, reduce the number of scooter providers from seven before Gaulke’s tragic death to three. Where once as many as 4,000 scooters were available in Nashville, many of which were strewn randomly on sidewalks, impeding pedestrians and the disabled, now each provider will be allowed up to 500 scooters initially, with the possibility for expansion if local authorities approve. The three providers will pay an application fee of $500 for each scooter. If a scooter, or electric bike, is found parked on a public sidewalk, the company can be fined $25. Nashville transportation officials can ban scooters from being ridden on certain sidewalks. There also is a curfew. Scooters can not be used after 10 p.m. on weekdays or after 11 p.m. on weekends. Providers must have two employees on duty locally for every 100 vehicles to keep sidewalks clear, and they must establish 24-hour consumer hotlines so people can report scooters that are parked illegally or impeding sidewalks. “There are a handful of cities that, when scooters first came on the scene, allowed an almost unlimited number of scooters and operators and that created a chaotic situation,” said Adam Kovacevich, Lime’s head of governments affairs for the Americas. That chaos has also compromised safety. A study released in May be the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at scooter use in Austin, Texas between September 5 and November 30, 2018. During that period there were 936,110 scooter trips taken. There were 190 people injured while riding a scooter, or 20 injuries per 100,000 trips. One-third of the injuries occurred on the user’s first scooter ride. “We have launched something we call First Ride Academy,” said Lime’s Kovacevich. “We host these academies when we enter a new city.” Essentially, the academies are a quick review of what to do and not to do. Lime has also given away helmets to users attending the academies. Anyone picking up a scooter without benefit of the safety backgrounder likely won’t have a helmet. There needs to be more user education in the view of Rachel Weintraub, legislative director and general counsel for the Consumer Federation of America. “An alarming 19% of those injured in the Austin study blamed the scooter itself, believing the brakes or accelerator malfunctioned,” Weintraub said. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for regulating the safety of e-scooters. But with a budget of $125 million the CPSC has jurisdiction over a panoply of products ranging from infants’ cribs to toys to space heaters to all-terrain vehicles to kitchen appliances. “Overwhelmed would be the more accurate word,” said Mike Gentine, a Washington, D.C., attorney with the firm of Schiff Hardin and a former CPSC general counsel from 2014 to 2017, when asked to assess the commission’s resources to take on a relatively new product such as e-scooters. In the near term, the rules of the road for e-scooters will be hammered out in local transportation agencies, mayors’ offices and city councils. Already some providers have improved the design and durability of their scooters. “These are pretty early days for the industry,” said Lime’s Kovacevich. “We are not wedded to scooters in their current form.” Nearly a year ago Lime introduced the Gen 3 scooter that weighs between 40 and 45 pounds, or about 10 to 15 pounds more than the previous iteration. It has a 30-mile range per charge, up from about 25 miles on the older model, and a dual-suspension and larger wheels should smooth out bumps from small potholes or bricks. We’ve had enough experience with scooters to gather substantial data on their safety. In addition to the CDC-Austin study, Consumer Reports published data in June 2019 showing eight people have died while using rentable scooters since fall of 2017. Using data from 110 hospitals in 47 U.S. cities, CR tabulated that at least 1,500 riders have been injured in that same period. Channeling scooters away from sidewalks and onto designated bicycle lanes seems to be the approach in a number of cities. “A lot of these incidents are preventable,” said Weintraub of the Consumer Federation of America. “There is still a lot more work to do before we can ensure the best way people can operate these devices without too much risk to pedestrians and others.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2019/09/16/nashville-mayor-proposed-e-scooter-ban-then-council-changed-the-rules/
City Leaders Consider New Electric Scooter Regulations,U.S. News,,National,2019,9,22,"City Leaders Consider New Electric Scooter Regulations. City leaders in Salt Lake City are considering a new law that would cite people who ride electric scooter on sidewalks in certain parts of downtown. City leaders in Salt Lake City threatened to crack down on electric scooters amid a spike in injuries and growing complaints of sidewalk riders from residents. The City Council will consider an ordinance that would regulate the scooters in the coming weeks, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. ""There is a sense that scooter riders feel entitled to the sidewalk, even when the sidewalk is crowded and even when they are next to a dedicated bike lane,"" wrote John Larsen, the city's transportation director, in an email earlier this week to companies who provide the scooters. ""They either don't know or don't care about the rules. We've made it clear that this is an important issue to the city since last summer, but we have seen little to no progress."" Under consideration are citations for sidewalk riders in parts of downtown, mandatory slow zones and curfews, among other changes. City leaders are also discussing a limit on scooter vendors, prioritizing companies who show they can curb sidewalk scootering. There are no formal rules governing the scooters, only a ""temporary operating agreement"" between the cities and companies that dictates how many scooters can be in the city and where they can be parked. Scooter advocates have praised the mode of transportation for its ability to ease traffic and greenhouse emissions and calling it a safer, faster alternative to driving. Some have said sidewalk ridership shows a need for more bike lanes in the city, so people can safely ride on the streets. ""Respectfully, if you would stop prioritizing cars over other modes and build more bike infrastructure, this would be far less of an issue!"" Mike Christensen, executive director of the Utah Rail Passengers Association, tweeted to Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski. ""I wish this much concern was being shown to automakers and other auto-related industries for the constant threat posed to people walking, biking, and riding scooters in our community."" Still, many are wary of sidewalk scootering. Emergency rooms have seen a drastic spike in injuries involving electric scooters including from broken noses, facial lacerations and blunt head trauma. Several scooter companies currently operate within the city's boundaries. Two of those companies, Lime and Spin, told the Tribune they were working to address sidewalk ridership with in-app reminders and warning stickers on the scooters. Despite the challenges, city leaders ""want the scooter program to work,"" Larsen told the Tribune. ""They're a popular thing and they're still incredibly safe compared to a car.""",https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/utah/articles/2019-09-22/city-leaders-consider-new-electric-scooter-regulations
Uber is trying everything to make bikes and scooters a profitable business ,CNN,,National,2019,9,26,"Uber is trying everything to make bikes and scooters a profitable business. Uber announced a number of changes to its bike and scooter business Thursday as the company faces pressure to become profitable. Uber will give its rentable bikes and scooters more prominence in its app next month in an attempt to increase ridership. In 2020, it will introduce swappable battery kiosks in cities, which will allow Uber (UBER) riders, drivers and couriers to exchange batteries on Jump-branded vehicles. Like all bike and scooter companies, Uber faces significant costs to charge and maintain its fleet. The company has increased rental prices this year. It's expensive to hire workers to travel around cities replacing dead batteries, so having riders swap batteries could reduce how many people Uber needs to pay. ""We're focused on ensuring this becomes an economically viable business over the long term,"" Rachel Holt, who leads new mobility at Uber, told CNN Business ahead of the event. ""We've seen tremendous improvements over the course of this year in that regard and a ton of efforts underway that will continue to improve that over next year."" Uber made the announcements at an event in San Francisco, which included updates on its ridesharing, food delivery, freight hauling businesses and some incremental safety features. Uber has been the subject of a slew of negative headlines lately, including big losses and rider safety issues. It also faces increased pressure to be profitable since its initial public offering in May. It reported record losses in its most recent financial quarter, and its stock price has dropped roughly 30% since going public. The company has gone through two rounds of layoffs, with the bike and scooter team impacted. Uber's Jump electric bikes, which propel a rider forward depending on how hard they pedal, has been a pioneer in the space; competitors have followed to offer their own models. Uber acquired Jump in April 2018. But Uber has pulled its electric bikes out of five markets this year, including San Diego, Dallas and Atlanta. The company described the exits as being decided on a case-by-case basis as it aims to make bikes and scooters a sustainable part of the transportation ecosystem. It will launch scooters in San Francisco next month after receiving government approval this week. Holt said Uber remains committed to bikes and scooters. ""We're definitely in rapid expansion mode, not contraction mode,"" she said. ""We believe this is part of the future of how people are going to get around. That is what makes us bullish."" As part of the strategy, Holt said Uber would pivot bikes and scooters away from cities with low ridership to other markets. Uber's increased promotion of bikes and scooters fits its goal to be the transportation company for everyone, no matter how they're traveling. Previously, Uber users had to toggle to a different screen in the app to see bikes and scooters. Now they'll see the small vehicles displayed in the map on Uber's home screen. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has talked of becoming the ""Amazon of transportation,"" alluding to how Amazon started as a bookstore before expanding to selling nearly everything. This summer, Uber experimented with promoting bikes and scooters prominently on the map on its app's home screen in two cities, and was pleased with the results, according to Holt. ""Choice is at the crux of our approach and strategy and what we're seeing — again it's early days — when you give consumers choice they engage more across our entire platform,"" Holt said. Uber also said Thursday that its bikes have been ridden 1 million times in Paris since launching five months ago.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/26/tech/uber-jump-app/index.html
The great electric scooter backlash,CBS News,CBS,National,2019,9,29,"The great electric scooter backlash. In the spring of 2018, the citizens of several American cities awoke to find something new: Thousands of electric scooters, mysteriously deposited all over town, unannounced. They were put there by a new breed of well-funded companies with one-syllable names (like Bird, Lime, Scoot, Spin and Jump) that want to introduce a cheap, fast, clean way to get around cities like Santa Monica, California. By using an app, a person can find any scooter nearby, charged and available. You point your phone's camera at the scooter's bar code and scan it, and you're ready to go. The scooters are simple to operate, and give users the freedom of a car, and the fresh air of a bicycle, for the price of taking the bus. The crazy part, said correspondent David Pogue, is that when you arrive at your destination, there is no dock or rack where you'd park the scooter. You tell the app you're done, and you just leave it for the next person to find. ""You put somebody on a scooter for the first time, and there's not a person that doesn't come off smiling; I love that,"" said Joe Kraus, the president of Lime. Its scooters have provided over 100 million rides so far, in more than 120 cities, in 30+ countries. ""What are the problems cities have?"" Kraus said. ""Pollution. Congestion. We drive around in these boxed aquariums on wheels. Scooters put you out in the world. They reduce congestion by taking cars off the road. And they're certainly incredibly efficient in terms of carbon emissions."" But somebody's got to recharge all those scooters every night. So, the scooter companies employ an army of freelancers, like William Neher in Washington, D.C. ""I've been able to make anywhere between $100 to $300 a night,"" Neher said. ""And then you're responsible for getting them back out on the street the next morning?"" asked Pogue. ""That is one big part of it. I'm about to load up at least maybe a dozen in my Prius ... I call it a clown car for scooters, quite honestly!"" An app tells Neher where to put the scooters back on the streets, and he releases the scooters at the drop points. The scooter companies insist on considerate, attractive placement. ""You don't want the scooters to be an eyesore,"" Neher said. ""You don;t want them to be in the way of sidewalks, we're not blocking fire hydrants."" Pogue asked, ""What are the benefits of having this kind of job as opposed to a 9-to-5 desk job?"" ""There's so much independence that I've gained from this. And I've never been skinnier, and my wallet's never been fatter! It's been remarkable."" What an amazing development, these scooters – good for us, good for our cities, good for the world! So, why have so many cities banned them? John Mirisch is the mayor of Beverly Hills, California, where the scooters are not allowed. ""They arrived overnight, and [are] dumped on people's lawns and all around the city,"" he said. ""And none of the scooter companies had talked to anyone at the city – they just kind of appeared. And for a lot of our residents, it was litter. ""There are other cities that are also upset that these companies just came and dumped their product, and we'd all collectively be left to deal with the impacts of what they were doing."" Yes, the impacts. People can leave the scooters anywhere, and sometimes that's in the middle of the sidewalk or on people's lawns. That carelessness infuriates other citizens to the point that scooter vandalism has been an ongoing problem. And then there's the other kind of impact: Catherine Lerer, a Los Angeles personal-injury lawyer, says people have suffered terrible injuries: ""Head injuries, broken bones, surgeries – injuries which are going to affect them for a lifetime. ""The calls that I get from riders who are injured, they are injured when the scooter malfunctions,"" she said. ""Do you get the impression that they malfunction much?"" asked Pogue. ""Very much, all the time,"" Lerer said. ""The scooters die mid-ride. The brakes lock up. The handlebar post collapses. The handlebars detach. They were never intended to be like rental cars, commercial fleet usage, you know, use after use after use every day. And that's why they have a lifespan of only 30 to 45 days!"" ""Do you think helmets would help?"" ""Yes, I think helmets are so, so important,"" Lerer replied. ""In California, we did have a helmet requirement."" And then came Bird, another scooter-sharing company, which sponsored a bill, signed into law, that removed the helmet requirement as of January 1 of this year. So, Pogue asked, ""You think this problem is fixable?"" ""I mean, it has to start with not only the helmets, but also inspecting these scooters on a daily basis,"" said Lerer. The great scooter backlash, and reports of at least eight rider deaths, seem to have humbled the scooter companies. According to Lime co-founder Toby Sun, the days of dumping scooters in cities are over. ""I think working with the city is very important,"" Sun said. ""We're in markets for the long run, right? So, I think building that trust and collaborative approach will get us a lot longer serving the cities and users."" Pogue asked, ""There are problems with accidents and parking and vandals and cities who don't get it. What percent confident are you that you will get through all of this, and scooter sharing will become a standard thing?"" ""My confidence level is 120%,"" Sun replied. ""I'm fully confident that this is going to be revolutionary."" That will happen only if cities agree to accommodate the scooters – for example, by designating places to ride them and park them. Lime's Joe Kraus thinks it will happen. ""it's happened before. By 1917, nine years after the introduction of the Model T, the last horse-drawn trolley was taken out of New York. In nine years, we took a city that was based around human and horses, and we transformed it into an urban landscape centered around cars. ""These periods of change can happen rapidly when there's big problems, in our case congestion [and] pollution, and there's a great solution. In that case, the Model-T. And I would argue today in the case of an incredibly efficient magic carpet that you can drive around for about three bucks a ride!""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-great-electric-scooter-backlash/
A man in Florida was arrested for cutting brake lines on dozens of electric scooters,CNN,,National,2019,10,2,"A man in Florida was arrested for cutting brake lines on dozens of electric scooters. A man in Florida has been sneaking around his neighborhood tampering with electric scooters parked on the streets, police say. Fort Lauderdale police posted a surveillance video Tuesday showing a man walking up to an electrical scooter on the street, slapping a white sticker on its QR code, and cutting its brake lines, essentially rendering it impossible to use. Police say that more than 140 scooters have been disabled and vandalized in a similar way in the southeast part of Fort Lauderdale since April 5. Officers had already homed in on 59-year-old Randall Williams as a possible suspect, and the majority of the acts of vandalism happened within two blocks of his apartment. Caught in the act Hoping to nab the saboteur, cops staked out the area over the weekend. In the early hours of Saturday and Sunday, police say they saw Williams leave his apartment on his nightly rounds of scooter sabotage. He ""walked the neighborhood in a stealthy fashion, utilizing the shadows and the alleyways to conceal his movements,"" according to their report. Police say they saw him vandalize seven scooters on Saturday, and an additional nine on Sunday. When they arrested Williams, he had with him two sets of wire cutters, a pair of hand-held lock pliers, and he was wearing a glove, the police report says. Police estimated the cost to fix each scooter at $70. For the total of 20 scooters to which they've linked him so far, the bill comes out to about $1,400. A spokeswoman for police told CNN that multiple brands of scooters were affected. The cost estimate for the vandalism doesn't take into account lost revenues from rentals while the scooters are inactive. Williams did not return CNN calls for comment Tuesday. According to the police report, Williams wanted to limit what he told authorities because he ""didn't want to dig himself into a grave."" He was booked on charges of criminal mischief, resisting officers, and loitering or prowling. He was released Monday after posting $500 in bond, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office. To help protect riders from jumping on a faulty scooter, a company operating the scooters, which authorities didn't name, deactivated all its scooters in the neighborhood, the police report says. Spokespeople for Lime, Bird and Bolt told CNN that they're grateful to authorities for taking action. Lime said that they'll seek ""appropriate legal action against those that damage or vandalize our property."" ""We have zero tolerance for vandalism and aggressively address it when it occurs,"" a Bird spokeswoman said. And Bolt co-CEO Sarah Haynes told CNN in a statement that the company had full-time teams with mechanics to ""continuously monitor"" and ""identify any cases of potential vandalism.""",https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/01/us/florida-scooters-vandalized-trnd/index.html
Florida man arrested for cutting the brakes on over 100 electric scooters,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,10,2,"Florida man arrested for cutting the brakes on over 100 electric scooters. The suspect offered no motive, telling police he ‘did not want to dig himself into a grave’. A 59-year-old resident of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was arrested and charged with criminal mischief after police caught him tampering with a couple of Lime electric scooters. After further investigation, police discovered a total of 20 scooters in the nearby area with their brakes cut, and they have linked the suspect, Randall Thomas Williams, to dozens more. There has been a rash of scooter vandalism in Fort Lauderdale, with police saying more than 140 two-wheelers have been damaged since April 2019. A majority of the incidents occurred near East Broward Boulevard, which is near Williams’ residence. All included severed brake lines. Williams offered no motive for the vandalism, telling police he “did not want to dig himself into a grave,” according to the SunSentinel. Typically, he set out before sunrise with a single glove, wire cutters, and pliers, searching for the popular yet controversial electric scooters, police said. Police notified Lime and other scooter operators about the damaged devices. The companies are proactively removing the scooters from service to avoid rider injury, they say. Police aren’t sure whether anyone was injured while riding the damaged scooters. Last year, Fort Lauderdale awarded a one-year permit to Lime, Bolt, and Bird. Those permits expire next month, at which time the city plans to discuss the impact scooters have had on transportation patterns and quality of life. Vandalism and depreciation are taking their toll on the scooter business. Companies are scrambling to roll out tougher, longer-lasting scooters in order to turnaround their cash-losing business. Encouraged by social media and a growing “techlash,” anti-scooter types have knocked them into the streets, thrown them off parking garages, or even doused them with lighter fluid and set them on fire.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20895028/scooter-brake-cut-vandalism-fort-lauderdale-fla
"Bird raises new funding at a $2.5 billion valuation, thanks to longer-lasting scooters",The Verge,Vox,National,2019,10,3,"Bird raises new funding at a $2.5 billion valuation, thanks to longer-lasting scooters. VCs aren’t done pumping money into e-scooter rental companies. Bird, a startup that rents out electric scooters, is being valued at $2.5 billion in a new funding round led by CDPQ and Sequoia Capital, the company announced at TechCrunch Disrupt on Thursday. The company says it raised $275 million in its Series D round, which it claims is a testament to the company’s effort to improve its unit economics. Bird’s new pre-money valuation was first reported earlier this summer by TechCrunch and The New York Times. It’s a slight increase over the company’s $2.3 billion valuation from last year, but it’s still a sign that venture capital firms aren’t done pumping money into e-scooter companies, despite reports of steep cash losses and rampant vandalism of the scooters. But the temperature around scooter sharing has definitely cooled down: Bird raised $418 million in financing last year. That may have something to do with grim reports that emerged earlier this year about the financial instability of scooter sharing. Bird lost nearly $100 million during the first quarter of 2019, while revenue shrank sharply to only about $15 million, according to The Information. In the spring, the scooter startup was down to about $100 million left in cash. Bird says it’s been able to woo investors, thanks to its renewed emphasis on unit economics. That’s how much revenue each individual scooter brings in for the company. One of the most important numbers to consider is the lifespan of each scooter. The more trips and miles a single scooter can cover, the better it is for scooter companies that have to recoup the cost of each vehicle before they can start making money. But reports suggested that electric scooters were breaking down before the companies were even able to recoup their costs. Last year, Quartz published an analysis based on numbers provided by the city of Louisville, Kentucky, that found the average lifespan of a scooter to be 28.8 days. Early models purchased off the shelf from Chinese manufacturers were breaking down under heavy fleet use, spurring the companies to design newer, better scooters. Bird CEO Travis VanderZanden told The Verge last March that each scooter needed to stay in service for six months for the company to break even. Since then, the company has rolled out not one, but two new scooters: Bird One in May and Bird Two in August. Both scooters, the company says, are designed to be more durable and longer-lasting. Bird One has an average lifespan of 15 months, while Bird Two has not been widely distributed yet. “Nearly a year ago, we recognized that the world was changing,” VanderZanden said in a statement. “Gone are the days when top line growth was the leading KPI for emerging companies. Positive unit economics is the new goal line. As a result, we pivoted from growth to unit economics as the top priority for the company.” According to sources familiar with the company, the new funding will be used to chart a clear path to profitability as well as continued vehicle research and development, which Bird believes is a contributing factor to positive unit economics.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20895798/bird-scooter-fundraising-valuation-unit-economics
Scooter Startup Bird Raises $275 Million In New Funding Round,Forbes,,National,2019,10,3,"Scooter Startup Bird Raises $275 Million In New Funding Round. Bird is refreshing its coffers and has raised an additional $275 million in Series D funding, the company announced Thursday. The new funding raises Bird’s post-money valuation to nearly $2.8 billion. Launched in 2017, Santa Monica-based Bird became the fastest company to ever reach a billion-dollar valuation, snagging “unicorn” status in a little over a year. It’s now raised a total of around $700 million in funding, including the latest round led by previous investor Sequoia and Quebec pension fund CDPQ. TechCrunch had previously reported that Bird was raising a round. Despite the initial craze, investor sentiment towards scooters has cooled. The scooter company has faced stiff competition from Lime, and entrants like Lyft and Uber. Uber has retrenched, removing its Jump bikes from markets like Atlanta and San Diego. Bird laid off 5% of its staff in March and continues to face pressure over whether scooters can be a sustainable business at all. Bird’s CEO and founder Travis VanderZanden acknowledged in the company’s funding announcement that the market had changed: “Gone are the days when top line growth was the leading KPI for emerging companies. Positive unit economics is the new goal line.” It’s a shift in sentiment that larger tech companies are facing as they head into the public markets. Consumer tech IPOs, from Uber to Lyft to Peloton, have all seen falling stock prices since their market debuts as public market investors hesitate to invest in their unprofitable business models. For now, Bird is able to continue swaying private market investors, like Sequoia and CDPQ, but it will have to do more with its new $275 million than just subsidize a money-losing business.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/10/03/bird-raises-275-million-series-d-funding/

Venture capital has enabled a boom in micromobility. How do you get around the city? More than half of the world’s 7.7 billion people live in urban areas. The United Nations says 2.5 billion more people could join them by 2050. That means traffic and congestion fees. For many of the short trips city dwellers make, cars aren’t necessary or practical. Which explains the boom in bikes and scooters, privately owned or shared. A growing number are electric. “We’re seeing a tremendous push, enabled by venture capital but not always, to spread and sprinkle around the world hundreds of millions of potential vehicles,” Horace Dediu, founder of research firm Asymco, said at the BloombergNEF San Francisco event this year. “Once they’re available, the bet of micromobility is that they will be picked up and used.” One luxury option is the foldable Gocycle, created by a former designer for the race car maker McLaren.

Hundreds lose their driving licenses during Oktoberfest e-scooter mayhem,CNN,,National,2019,10,7,"Hundreds lose their driving licenses during Oktoberfest e-scooter mayhem.  German police have revealed that hundreds of electric scooter users lost their driving licenses after riding while drunk at the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich. A total of 414 people were caught riding an e-scooter while under the influence, and 254 lost their driving licenses as a result, according to a police statement released Monday.  In 32 cases, police patrols intervened to prevent drunk driving. In Germany, e-scooters, which were only legalized in June, are categorized as motorized vehicles.  This means that drink-driving laws apply to riders -- as some found out the hard way during the world's largest beer festival. Police identified e-scooters as a new challenge during the 16-day Oktoberfest -- an annual festival of traditional German food, dancing, beer and clothing that ran from September 19 to October 4 -- working to keep the festival grounds clear of the vehicles.  To stop riders abandoning their e-scooters in the grounds, they were prevented from logging out of the scooter hire app while on site, and clusters of abandoned scooters were removed each night from around the city. Authorities around the world are currently grappling with how to deal with scooters. As urban populations swell, cities and start-ups have been searching for fresh transportation solutions. E-scooters offer an affordable and quick way to make short trips in congested cities, much like bicycles, but without anyone breaking a sweat.  However they can be a nuisance -- piling up in roadways and at popular destinations -- as well as dangerous. After a spate of injuries, city authorities in Austin, Texas, asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate e-scooter-related crashes and injuries. The study, published in May, found that one in three injured riders were hurt on their first trip, and about 63% had ridden nine times or fewer before their injury. The researchers concluded that additional training may be necessary for e-scooter riders.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/oktoberfest-police-report-scli-intl-grm/index.html
"Uber, Spin, and Lime scooters are now legal in San Francisco, but Skip is out",The Verge,Vox,National,2019,10,15,"Uber, Spin, and Lime scooters are now legal in San Francisco, but Skip is out. The balance of scooter power in SF shifts. San Francisco announced recently that it was expanding its permit program to include Uber’s Jump, Ford’s Spin, and Lime — companies that were previously barred from operating scooters in the city. But the expansion of the city’s scooter operators isn’t all good news: Skip, one of the companies that was part of San Francisco’s original pilot program, wasn’t granted a permit and just sent a message to customers saying that it would cease service. “Starting today, October 15, Skip scooters will no longer be rentable as part of SFMTA’s Powered Scooter Share Program for 2019-2020,” the company said in a message to users, which was obtained by The Verge. “Over the last year, it’s been a privilege to serve you and invest in our hometown, the city of San Francisco. We hope to see you again soon.” Skip was one of two companies that was awarded a permit under San Francisco’s original pilot program in August 2018. (The other was Scoot.) But with the appearance of 2,500 additional scooters on the city’s streets this past week, Skip is calling it quits. The company still operates scooters in Washington, DC, San Diego, and Austin. In a statement to The Verge, Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor laid much of the blame at the feet of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). “Skip was one of two operators in the San Francisco pilot for scooter sharing this past year,” he said. “However, we were the sole existing operator not selected for the upcoming year’s expansion. The past two weeks have been both humbling and awful for our team.” Dastoor said Skip repeatedly sought guidance on SFMTA’s decision regarding its permit renewal to no avail. “Unlike permit grantees, we did not receive news that we were not admitted into the program until we read it in the press,” he said. “This show of thoughtlessness and disrespect left us scrambling to respond to our panicked employees.” SFMTA “dodged and denied” the company’s request for meetings, Dastoor claimed. And now, as a result of the permitting decision, Skip will have to lay off dozens of employees, he said. “We respect SFMTA’s authority to administer a program how they see fit,” he concluded. “That said, we believe Skip is the best operator positioned to serve San Francisco and for the past 12 months, we’ve demonstrated this admirably. We also ask that, pending our appeal, SFMTA grant our company a stay to allow us to continue operating and employing our team in San Francisco.” A spokesperson for SFMTA did not immediately return a request for comment. Under the expanded program, Jump, Lime, and Spin are allowed to operate 500 scooters each, while Bird’s Scoot will have 1,000, down from the 1,250 scooters it was permitted to operate previously. (The company, which was acquired by Bird earlier this year, remains in “good standing” with the city, despite the fleet reduction.) The limit for new operators will increase to 750 scooters on December 15th and to 1,000 on February 15, 2020, as long as they are compliant with the terms of the program. The city is also initiating a “more stringent” process for tracking complaints and scooter scofflaws. In a blog post, the SFMTA said: The new Powered Scooter Share Permit includes a more stringent complaint tracking process through a shared complaint database. Operators will be required to track all complaints (and the resolution of these complaints) and provide this information to SFMTA on a regular basis. Operators will also be required to take proactive measures to ensure that their customers are aware that sidewalk riding is both unsafe and illegal and implement deterrent measures, including graduated monetary penalties and suspensions for those who engage in unsafe riding behavior.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20916089/uber-jump-spin-lime-skip-scooter-san-francisco
Scooter Startup Ignores Uber Lesson in Luxembourg Night Raid,Bloomberg,Bloomberg,National,2019,10,16,"Scooter Startup Ignores Uber Lesson in Luxembourg Night Raid. Ride-hailing companies including Uber Technologies Inc. and Bolt Technology OU learned the hard way that turning up unannounced doesn’t work in Europe. Now one e-scooter startup seems keen to make the same mistake. Late on Oct. 7, the mayor of Luxembourg City received an email from U.S. startup Bird Rides Inc. saying it would roll out its service overnight. The next morning, dozens of electric scooters lined the pavements. Just over a week later, on Thursday, Bird was forced to pause its service. “It was a cloak and dagger operation Monday night, without anyone having really been informed,” said Dany Frank, spokeswoman of the Luxembourg Transport Ministry. “The way in which it was done wasn’t great.” One of the EU’s smallest nations, Luxembourg has been promising to make public transport free of charge. City bikes, called Vel’OH!, and car-sharing services have existed for years, but adding electric scooters wasn’t planned. Mayor Meeting The mayor, Lydie Polfer, has rejected requests by seven scooter firms over the past two years, her office said in an email. This included San Diego, California-based Bird, which was told in early June there was no interest in its services. The two sides met on Thursday, after which Bird said in a statement that it was ""working to address the mayor’s concerns."" “We are temporarily pausing our service while we make these changes,” the company said. “While we know this is disappointing for the thousands of people who have already used Bird, we believe it is best to work closely with the cities we operate in, so we will make these changes first, before resuming the service.” More than 2,000 people had already downloaded the app and taken a ride in the city, Bird said earlier. The smash and grab attempt by Bird mirrors early attempts by Uber to expand across Europe, only to be banned by cities including Barcelona and Dusseldorf. Bolt was also turfed out of London for failing to have the correct license. Scooter companies have spread across Europe, targeting tourist spots such as Paris and Lisbon, raising hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital funding in the process. Bird is one of the world’s largest, and said earlier this month it had bagged another $275 million of financing to continue growing. Lime is another billion-dollar scooter behemoth whose bright green two-wheelers are a familiar site in many capital cities. More Accidents? Judith Pretty, a British-Luxembourg national who’s lived in the country for 25 years, has mixed feelings about the scooters that are scattered across pavements just a few blocks from where she lives. She’s worried it will cause “a massive increase in accidents.” Luxembourg’s population has grown rapidly in recent years to just over 600,000. Added to that, 200,000 commuters from neighboring France, Belgium and Germany travel in and out Luxembourg every day, meaning the few roads that lead to the center are choked with traffic mornings and evenings. For now, Luxembourg City refuses to say whether it will try to send Bird packing. While the commune said it welcomes initiatives that boost mobility, it “doesn’t appreciate the lack of information,” which raise “important questions of management and security.” Ruben Costa, 23, likes the sudden addition to Luxembourg’s pavements. Freshly arrived from Portugal to do a five-month internship in the city as a translator, he says scooters “are all the rage” back home in Lisbon and “will certainly help with getting around traffic here too.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-17/scooter-startup-ignores-uber-lesson-in-luxembourg-smash-and-grab
San Francisco Opens New Office to Prevent Another E-Scooter Debacle,Observer,,National,2019,10,22,"San Francisco Opens New Office to Prevent Another E-Scooter Debacle. San Francisco: I love you. And I hate you. I used to live in the City by the Bay, and I witnessed the whole trajectory course of run amok tech that ignited a fury amongst citizens only seen this side of a Google bus protest. Sure, Market Street in downtown San Francisco, is now the home of Twitter Dolby, and Uber headquarters, but mere blocks away homeless people are living in mass in tents on the streets of the Tenderloin. This dance of the haves-and-the-have-nots—existing side-by-side—creates a cacophony of smug entitlement vs. screaming at the midday sun in anger. And I’ve seen it happen. Take the roll-out of sharable electric scooters. In March of 2018, the idea was for an alternative form of public transportation, allowing San Francisco citizens to merrily roll along to their million-dollar startup jobs with the grin of a moron plastered on their faces. Bird, Spin and Lime were three companies that wanted to jumpstart the San Francisco sharable scooter craze. These dockless scooters appeared almost overnight. The only problem was that the scooters became a pure public nuisance. “GET OUT OF THE WAY!” idiots would often yell, as they illegally rode on the sidewalks. The scooters cluttered sidewalks and blocked pedestrian walkways. A great allegory for this reckless tech roll-out; it was reported that homeless people were setting the scooters on fire, along with throwing them in the San Francisco Bay. The “haves” had their irritating scooters; the “have nots” were lighting them into flames. The San Francisco scooter craze was a pure train wreck. The thrill was gone. All three companies received cease and desist letters from the city attorney. Further, because of these dumb scooters, the city also passed a law, demanding that these devices must have a permit What did San Francisco learn from this debacle? How would the city prevent electric scooter history from repeating itself? Just last week, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Norman Yee had a cunning plan. He unveiled a proposal to create an Office of Emerging Technology. Yee told KQED News that the office would be the first of its kind in the country. In summary, the purpose of the office would be to prevent another reckless tech roll-out—like what was seen with the electric scooter fiasco—making sure the next wave of tech services obtain the proper permits to operate on San Francisco’s streets, sidewalks and other infrastructure. And Yee has already secured $250,000 from San Francisco’s current fiscal year budget to fund the new office. Besides issuing permits, the Office of Emerging Technology will also weigh the potential impact of proposed technology before giving pilot projects and/or product launches the green light. So a tech company that has developed, say, a robot dog walking service (actually not a bad idea), can’t just pop up overnight and roll out its tech service on the city streets—without getting the green light and proper permits. Some of the recent tech roll-outs just trumpet problems that need to be addressed. In 2017, Knightscope K5 autonomous security robots were deployed on the streets of San Francisco to ward off homeless people emcampments. But some of these robots were being operated in public without permits. And people hated these security robots; there were reports of folks knocking them over or dousing their sensors with barbecue sauce. One poor robot was veiled with a tarp. Another was covered in poo. (Ewww!) And the irony? The cost of the five-foot-tall, 400-pound Knightscope K5 security robot could have been put toward opening additional, and well-needed, homeless shelters. Meanwhile, its good to see the City of San Francisco spend $250,000 on making sure people aren’t annoyed by electric scooters while they whizz by the city’s increasing homeless population.",https://observer.com/2019/10/san-francisco-emerging-technology-office-electric-scooter-debacle/
In the Van With the ‘Juicers’ Who Round Up and Recharge Lime Scooters,New York Times,,National,2019,10,25,"In the Van With the ‘Juicers’ Who Round Up and Recharge Lime Scooters. Michelle and Gonzalo Cabezas begin their nightly scavenger hunt at 10. That’s when they start looking for the Lime scooters that people rent and ride by the minute — and leave wherever they please. “People take them to the darnedest spots,” Mrs. Cabezas said from the passenger seat of her husband’s cargo van in northeast Los Angeles. The Lime app was open on her iPhone, navigating toward the night’s first bounty, a sideways scooter a few houses from their own driveway. They’d earn $4.50 to pick up and recharge it. Drive down most major streets in Los Angeles and it’s an obstacle course of Skittles-colored mobility devices: green Limes, yellow Bolts, red Jump bicycles. Eight on-demand e-scooter and e-bike companies are permitted to operate in the city, and after a handful of rides, they all need juice. Mr. and Mrs. Cabezas are among Lime’s army of “juicers”: independent contractors who sign up to charge scooters through the same app that riders use to rent them. Out on their mission, Mr. Cabezas scanned the scooter’s QR code with his wife’s phone and loaded the Lime in the van. Then they were off to the next one, two blocks away in an alley. And another, around the corner in a public park. They picked up 16 scooters in an hour to charge at home, earning $67. San Francisco-based Lime hires about 60,000 freelance juicers in the 100 markets where it operates. The company pays $3 to $10 per scooter that is retrieved, recharged and then released in “deployment zones” of its choosing. Across the country, in dozens of cities, start-ups are conducting a grand experiment in two-wheeled, electric-powered urban mobility. And nowhere is that experiment more grand than in Los Angeles, where Lime operates 5,000 of the 37,500 scooters and e-bikes that the city is testing as part of the country’s largest dockless mobility program. Robert Cartwright is a charger for Bird, a Santa Monica company that started the e-scooter craze two years ago. It operates in 100 cities worldwide and, like Lime, farms out its recharging to anyone 18 or older with a smartphone and a willingness to do it. He moved to Los Angeles from Ohio a month ago in pursuit of a music career and started working as a charger “to make a lot of money fast,” he said. “If you do it every day, you can make $40,000 a year.” Mr. Cartwright doesn’t own a car. He uses a Bird scooter to gather other Birds, sometimes riding five at a time stacked like a pinwheel to take them back to his apartment for recharging. Once their batteries are full, he borrows a friend’s car to drop them off in the “nests” where Bird needs them. For each one, he makes about $6. He also does “move tasks” for $2 each, riding a scooter from an obscure place to a more in-demand spot near public transit hubs or along walkable thoroughfares with well-trafficked businesses. In total, he makes about $160 a day. That’s comparable to an Uber driver, “only you don’t got to deal with people or talk to people,” Mr. Cartwright said.

But it’s proving lucrative for some of the thousands who do it; some chargers report making as much as $50 an hour. It isn’t without its complications. On my drive with Mr. and Mrs. Cabezas, they used the app to find two Lime scooters at an apartment building, only to discover them locked behind a gate. Another scooter was being loaded into a pickup truck just as the couple drove up. There are also hoarders, who drive around picking up scooters knowing that they will eventually need recharging, even if the scooter company hasn’t yet posted them to the app. And then there are the scooters that have a flat tire or are somehow broken and require a special trip to a fix-it location. The job requires more than just figuring out the app. Making it profitable means understanding the city well enough to know if a tantalizing cluster of scooters is in a dangerous area. Also knowing where to park, because there’s no easier way to wipe out a night’s earnings than getting a costly ticket. There’s also the upfront equipment cost. New juicers pay Lime $10 per charger. Mr. and Mrs. Cabezas said they had spent about $250 for the two dozen chargers they used, many bought secondhand. Still, Mr. and Mrs. Cabezas said it was worth their time. Working three or four nights a week, the couple have made about $5,000 since May, with little spent out of pocket. They said that their electricity bill had risen about $10 a month and that they spent about $5 in gas each night. As much these gigs may be a boon to the workers, there are questions about the mobility programs’ environmental and economic sustainability. A recent study from North Carolina State University found that driving around to pick up, recharge and release the scooters accounted for 40 percent of a scooter’s total greenhouse gas emissions. On average, chargers drive between a half mile and two-and-a-half miles per scooter, said Jeremiah Johnson, one of the study’s authors. About 17 percent of the scooters picked up for recharging didn’t need it; they still had 95 percent of their charge. “The charging itself, the electricity when you plug it in, is actually pretty small — just 5 percent of the total burdens,” he said. And then there are the economics. It costs less than 10 cents to recharge a scooter, according to ARK Invest, an investment management company focused on disruptive innovation. ARK researched the viability of the scooter economy this year and found that the real expense in charging wasn’t electricity but moving the scooters to prominent spots. ARK found that scooter companies were generating $2.43 per mile in revenue but spending $2.55 per mile to keep the scooters operating. If companies used drivers for Uber and Lyft to move scooters, they could save $1.03 a mile, ARK said. Uber and Lyft offer scooters through their ride-hailing apps, and both companies handle their own recharging. A Lyft official said its system “means that our team directly controls and oversees all aspects of operations, including drop-off, pickup, charging, cleaning and fixing — all within a local warehouse.” Cities’ embrace of scooters has not always been smooth. Since September 2018, Santa Monica has been operating a pilot program with 3,000 permitted scooters. A year earlier, when Bird kicked off the scooter revolution by leaving them parked without permission, there were some “initial complaints about people pirating electricity on occasion,” the city manager, Rick Cole, said. “People who said, ‘Hey, somebody plugged into my outlet.’” Those issues were minor, he said, and handled on a case-by-case basis. The larger concern has been ensuring that the recharged scooters aren't left in areas where they’re a hazard. In Los Angeles, the struggle is putting more scooters in low-income communities underserved by public transit. “Are they deploying in a way that’s not over-deploying in some neighborhoods and underserving others?” said Seleta Reynolds, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. The agency forecasts 16 million e-scooter and e-bike trips in the city this year, and is working with the companies to make sure the scooters are left in appropriate locations. “It’s not perfect by a long shot,” Ms. Reynolds said. “These companies are learning in real time just as we are.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/business/lime-bird-scooters-rechargers.html
LA suspends Uber’s scooters and bikes permit after company refuses to share data,The Guardian,,National,2019,11,4,"LA suspends Uber’s scooters and bikes permit after company refuses to share data. The corporation rents electric vehicles via Jump and has until Friday to appeal or their permit will be revoked. Los Angeles has suspended Uber’s permit to rent electric scooters and bicycles because the corporation refused to follow the city’s rules on data sharing. The temporary suspension could result in the city confiscating scooters and bikes of Uber’s subsidiary Jump. It marks the latest conflict between local governments and the rideshare company, which has repeatedly flouted traditional transportation regulations. Out of eight companies granted permits to operate scooters in LA, Uber is the only one that has refused to provide its data to the city, Colin Sweeney, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) spokesperson said Monday. The city suspended Uber’s permit last week, and if the company does not appeal the suspension by Friday, the permit would officially be revoked, he said. Uber and its subsidiary Jump, which operates the scooters and bikes, have threatened to sue the city over the dispute. “Our permit specifications are important … so that we can ensure the safety and livability of our neighborhoods, and so we can manage the companies and ensure they are abiding by the rules,” Sweeney told the Guardian. “Jump is the only one that is not in compliance.” The LA suspension follows months of debate over a policy that requires the companies to provide data to the city on the trips each vehicle takes. The city argues that information helps it track the number of scooters and bikes in use and where they are being parked in an effort to address concerns about the electric vehicles clogging sidewalks and neighborhoods. Uber and some privacy groups, however, have raised concerns about surveillance and have argued the tracking could allow for the misuse of personal data. “We believe that LADOT’s requirements to share sensitive real-time location data compromises our customers’ expectations of data privacy and security,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement Monday. “Independent privacy experts have clearly and repeatedly asserted that a customer’s geolocation is personally identifiable information.” The statement said Uber had no choice but to “pursue a legal challenge”, adding, “We sincerely hope to arrive at a solution that allows us to provide reasonable data and work constructively with the City of Los Angeles while protecting the privacy of our riders.” The city has strict privacy and confidentiality standards, and the data is not subject to public records requests, said Sweeney: “It’s held in the highest confidence. The city only collects data on scooters, not riders.” Uber received multiple warnings about the potential suspension before it went into effect. Users in LA can still rent Jump bikes and scooters this week while the permit is suspended, but if it is formally revoked, it will no longer be lawful for the company to operate. At that point, the bikes and scooters would be subject to confiscation, said Sweeney. Jump’s permit allows for 5,500 scooters and bikes, and the company currently has more than 2,000 on the streets of LA. The city approved a total of 36,170 dockless vehicles across LA, including permits for Uber, Lyft, Lime, Bird, Spin and several others. The arrival of scooters in cities across America has prompted a number of legal battles. In Santa Monica, California, the city filed a criminal complaint against the company Bird after scooters appeared on the streets overnight before legislation had been adopted. San Francisco initially banned scooters after a chaotic rollout. Over the years, Uber has also defied regulations surrounding self-driving cars, and in 2016 was forced to remove them from San Francisco.",http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/uber-los-angeles-permit-data-privacy
Singapore joins France in banning e-scooters on sidewalks,CNN,,National,2019,11,4,"Singapore joins France in banning e-scooters on sidewalks. Singapore has banned the riding of e-scooters on sidewalks in the city-state from Monday, November 4 after a growing number of accidents involving the motorized devices, including at least one fatality. Senior Minister of State for Transport Lam Pin Min said in parliament Sunday that there would be an advisory period until December 31, involving warnings for riders. But after January 1, 2020, there would be ""strict enforcement"" of the new laws. ""Those caught riding on e-scooter on footpaths will be liable for a fine of $1,472 (SGD$2000) and, or, jail up to three months,"" Lam said. It is expected that other personal mobility devices (PMDs), like hoverboards and electric bikes, could fall under the ruling as well. The move came shortly after the death of a 65-year-old woman who collided with an e-scooter while riding her bike in late September. According to the Straits Times, she died in the hospital from a brain injury several days after the accident. Lam said that the calls for a ban had been getting louder after an increasing number of road accidents and continued abuse of e-scooter regulations. He added the laws would not extend to people with disabilities, as wheelchairs are a kind of PMDs as well. Singapore is not alone in banning the motorized scooters from its sidewalks. The devices are no longer allowed on sidewalks in France, after thousands of e-scooters began to cause tensions with residents. But the fines there are almost a tenth of the size of Singapore's, coming in at just $150 (135 euros). Minister Lam said that the convenience of e-scooters for commuting and food delivery services had led them to grow rapidly to almost 100,000 devices across the city. He said they'd tried to regulate them by putting in place safe-riding programs, speed limits and licenses for riders, but it hadn't been enough to curb accidents. ""We continue to encounter errant riders who use non-compliant devices and ride dangerously,"" he said. Lam said 370 offenders were caught on average a month violating e-scooter regulations, leading to an increasing number of accidents. ""This ban of e-scooters from footpaths is a difficult decision but it is a necessary step for pedestrians to feel safe again on public paths,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/singapore-e-scooter-ban-intl-hnk/index.html

Riding While Drunk and Other Dangers of the Electric Scooter Craze,New York Times,,National,2019,11,6,"Riding While Drunk and Other Dangers of the Electric Scooter Craze. Get ready, New York. Hoboken shows what happens when the scooters come to town. A new state law may soon bring electric scooters to the streets of New York City. But a mile away in New Jersey, Hoboken already offers a test case of the promises and the perils of the electric vehicles, which have taken hold across the world. Hoboken was the first city in New Jersey to allow riders to rent motorized, two-wheeled scooters, joining a long list of cities that have embraced them in the past few years, including San Francisco, Chicago, Paris, Barcelona and Sydney, Australia. The scooters have been a big hit in many places because they offer an inexpensive alternative on congested streets and can be picked up and dropped off on almost any block. But they have also drawn increasing criticism about the recklessness of some riders. And there have been complaints that the scooters are carelessly tossed aside on sidewalks, parks, plazas and even lawns. In Hoboken, the problem has gotten so bad that the city has had to hire two officers whose job is to police unruly riders. Some riders have even been caught scootering while drunk. “The rollout in some cities has been rocky,” said Steven Pedigo, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. “We’ve had safety issues. We’ve had too many scooters in some cities.” But if managed well, he added, scooter-sharing programs can reduce car traffic and help solve the “mobility crisis” that many cities are facing. In Hoboken, the scooters are so coveted that commuters line up to claim them on weekday evenings. Residents returning from work in Manhattan simply point their smartphones at a scooter to unlock it, hop on and slip into street traffic at speeds of up to 18 miles an hour. Each ride costs $1 plus 15 cents a minute. But not all of the riders obey the rules. The scooters are intended to be parked out of the way of pedestrians and other traffic, but can be left practically anywhere. Some users break the rules by riding on sidewalks or after patronizing the bars and clubs that make Hoboken a hot spot for nighttime revelers. On a recent weekend, the Hoboken police charged a 34-year-old woman from Jersey City with scootering while intoxicated. A few days before that, they arrested a 26-year-old scooter rider after she collided with a car and fell to the ground. A breath test showed that her blood-alcohol content was twice the legal limit, the police said. That was the third time the Hoboken Police Department had arrested someone for riding a scooter while drunk, Chief Kenneth F. Ferrante said, adding that offenders “face the same penalties as if they were operating a car.” To take some of the burden off the police, Hoboken hired two “micromobility code enforcement officers” who can ticket scooter riders for failing to obey traffic laws, said Ryan Sharp, the city’s director of transportation and parking. The money to pay the officers will come from a revenue-sharing deal the city struck this summer with Lime, the company operating the scooter system. Hoboken authorized the scooters as a six-month pilot program. The city has hired a consultant to assess the program, which ends in late November. “Over the next four weeks or so, we’ll be figuring out how we want to proceed,” Mr. Sharp said. “All options are on the table.” Hoboken is an ideal candidate for a scooter program, Mr. Sharp said, because 60 percent of its residents commute to work, mostly by train or ferry from Hoboken Terminal. Practically all of them live within one and a half miles of the terminal. But Janna Chernetz, the deputy director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, says many cities are suitable for scooters if their residents and elected officials see them as a legitimate form of transportation, not just vehicles for joy rides. “It’s a cultural mind-set change that you need to share the road,” Ms. Chernetz said. Lime, which has scooters in cities around the world, is the exclusive provider in Hoboken. The pilot program started with a second provider, Ojo, but the city dropped it in September after a 13-year-old boy crashed one of the company’s scooters into a woman who was pushing her 3-month-old son in a stroller on a sidewalk. The woman, Kate Cohen, testified at a City Council meeting that neither she nor her baby was seriously injured. “I am so lucky that this wasn’t more serious, but I am haunted by the potential risk that remains,” she said. Ms. Cohen did not call for a ban on the scooters, but said the city needed to do more to enforce the rules, including a prohibition against riders under the age of 18. At that meeting, the Council voted to ban the scooters from parks and the Hudson River waterfront, limiting their use to roadways and bike lanes. In some cities, the reaction to scooters has been more drastic. In June, Nashville’s mayor abruptly ended a pilot program that involved Lime and several other scooter providers, including the ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft, after a rider who had been drinking was killed in a collision with a car. In an August letter to the Metropolitan Council, the legislative body for the consolidated city-county government in Nashville, Mayor David Briley, a Democrat, wrote that the safety of residents, workers and visitors “remains at risk with more than 2,000 scooters still zipping through our streets and littered across our sidewalks.” But the Council voted against banning scooters altogether, deciding instead to reduce each company’s fleet by half. In New York, lawmakers in Albany passed a bill this year that would legalize electric-powered bikes and scooters, with one notable exception. The bill singled out Manhattan as the only place in the state where scooters would not be legal. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not yet signed it into law, so New York City has not yet authorized their use in any of its other four boroughs. “New York City is one of the places that, without the prohibition, the companies would have launched in long ago,” said Juan Matute, the deputy director of the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies. “It has density, the ability to pay, a preponderance of short trips. And people are looking for an alternative to the subway.” In the meantime, New Yorkers who want to try a rental scooter would have to cross the Hudson to Hoboken, Asbury Park or one of a few other places in New Jersey where they are available. Despite the accidents and arrests in Hoboken, the scooters have been firmly embraced. On a recent weeknight, commuters leaving the PATH train station at the south end of the city waited impatiently as two young men unloaded 73 Lime scooters from a packed van. Within minutes, all but a few were gone. Phil Jones, a senior director for government relations at Lime, said more than 30,000 users had taken a total of more than 500,000 rides on the company’s scooters in Hoboken in five months. Lime started out with 250 scooters there in May and now has more than 300 in Hoboken, a compact city with about 50,000 residents. Mr. Jones said Lime had canceled the accounts of more than 500 people for violations of its rules, such as allowing children to ride or carrying passengers. Others have been warned or fined for lesser offenses, he said. “We try to give everyone a chance to correct their behavior,” he said. One regular rider, David Polinchock, said he was annoyed when he saw others riding scooters on the sidewalks. “What Hoboken did really, really well for us is they put in the bike lanes first,” Mr. Polinchock said. “I get frustrated when I see people zipping down the sidewalk next to the bike lane.” A former Brooklyn resident who used to bike to work in Manhattan, Mr. Polinchock said riding scooters in Hoboken was low-risk by comparison. “I got doored, I got cut off, there were potholes galore,” he said, rattling off the hazards of biking on the streets of New York. Now living in Bloomfield, N.J., he rides the scooters between Hoboken Terminal and his office on the border of Jersey City, an inexpensive way to shorten his daily commute. But, he added, not every city can handle them. Mr. Polinchock described the harrowing scooter rides he took this summer while he was in downtown Los Angeles for a conference, and said he couldn’t imagine the vehicles ever making sense in Manhattan. “It’s a nightmare,” he said of the notion.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/nyregion/lime-scooter-hoboken.html
Paris Ends an E-Scooter Melee With New Rules of the Road,Wired,,National,2019,11,8,"Paris Ends an E-Scooter Melee With New Rules of the Road. France is moving to crack down on scooter sharing, but questions linger about how micromobility affects cities and citizens. It’s hard to find a city where e-scooter services have launched without causing some commotion, and Paris is no exception. The shareable rideables first appeared in the French capital in June 2018. By summer 2019, a dozen companies were competing for a share of the market, with a combined fleet of 20,000 scooters. The result has been scooters littering sidewalks and lining the bottom of the River Seine. Crashes were inevitable. In June of this year, a 25-year-old rider was hit by a truck and killed. As in other swamped cities, these scooters have been operating in a legal gray zone. And like other cities and states, France has moved to change that. In the coming weeks, national regulations will come into effect limiting scooter speeds to 15 mph and mandating that riders stick to bike paths. In the meantime, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo has worked with the scooter companies on a code of conduct for riders, and is setting up hundreds of dedicated parking spots to end anarchic parking. She also plans to reduce the number of providers down to three for a combined fleet of 15,000, starting in January 2020. That’s not all bad news for the scooter companies. The free-for-all made survival tough, and six operators voluntarily left the market over the summer. Having too many scooters in service decreased profitability and led to more damages on idle vehicles, Henri Capoul, Bolt’s France country manager, told WIRED in an email. Bolt pulled out in June, and intends to come back by bidding for one of those permits. “What Paris now needs is a clear framework for deploying scooters in a smart way, making sure they fit the public space and transportation services,” he wrote. While other sharing economy companies like Uber and Airbnb have made a habit of defying regulations, many e-scooter startups are actively working with European municipalities to define new legal frameworks. “The legal limbo doesn’t work in our favor at all. What works is to set clear rules, and that those who want to use them know how to use them,” says Emeline Chicha, Lime’s head of communications for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. For e-scooters to thrive, Chicha says, they need a combination of existing infrastructure, regulations, and behaviors. Germany has been receptive to e-scooters because of a clear regulatory framework and an openness to alternative modes of transportation. Companies were able to launch smoothly in Tel Aviv, whose dry climate and long, flat bike lanes make a near-perfect setting for scooters. “If there is no awareness of micromobility, and the city has been built only for cars, it cannot work,” Chicha says. Hidalgo is a progressive mayor with a bright green streak. She has pedestrianized Paris’ riverside expressways and launched an ambitious plan to develop the city’s biking infrastructure. But like the leaders of most metropolises, her administration failed to anticipate the rise of micromobility—not just e-scooters but also electric bicycles, electric skates, hoverboards, and the like—and the many new startups that are banking on their shared use. In an interview with Le Monde last year, Hidalgo said her team should have seen dockless bike sharing coming, before they finished upgrading Vélib’, the city’s massive bike-share system. The new fleet includes electric bikes, but users still have to pick up and return their rides at the docks around town. E-scooters, too, were a surprise. “The city was a little overwhelmed because it didn’t want to appear anti-innovation or anti-novelty,” says Jean-Sébastien Catier, who heads Paris en Selle, a citizen association that campaigns for increased biking infrastructure in Paris. “By the time they reacted, it was a little too late.” Now, with little data on e-scooter usage and few examples from other cities as to what role micromobility could play in the overall urban transportation landscape, Paris must regulate e-scooter usage and invest in new infrastructure to make its citizens safe. The French capital is likely to be a crucial market for shared e-scooter operators to capture. Its high density translates into higher scooter usage, increasing cost-effectiveness. Around the Louvre museum in Paris’ first arrondissement, Lime scooters stay idle for less than one minute per day, Lime’s Chicha said. If Lime and its competitors can figure out their economics—most likely in cities with the right sort of weather, topography, and density—they’ll have plenty of happy customers. But for cities like Paris, that brings up another question: Are scooters good for urban mobility as a whole? The early data we have isn’t entirely promising. In a survey on shared e-scooter use in Paris, 30 percent of “local” users (residents, as opposed to visitors) said they would have made their last trip using public transportation had shared e-scooter services not existed. Studies show that ride-hailing apps have contributed to a drop in transit ridership in some American cities. Scooters could do the same. And despite claims that shared e-scooters can offer an alternative to driving (“the final objective is to take people out of the cars,” says Lime’s Emeline Chicha), the Paris survey showed that almost half of shared e-scooter rides by locals replaced walking. Just 8 percent replaced trips made by car. Signs also point to a consolidation of the shared mobility market through partnerships or acquisitions, with e-scooters being part of a broader service offering that gives user flexibility and convenience, and reinforces the company’s value proposition. This is likely why Uber acquired Jump and Lyft bought Motivate. Such consolidation could fuel private transportation. Public transit authorities need a sustained revenue from ridership in order to maintain infrastructure and keep servicing low-income people. With quality of service declining, more people would hit the roads and congestion would increase. In that scenario, no one benefits. On the other hand, startups could benefit from integrating public transit into their offering, which seems to be what Uber was after when it partnered with Denver’s Regional Transportation District for a pilot project, and Lyft and Uber moved to integrate public transit information into their apps. In Paris, they will soon be competing with a new multimodal app to be launched in 2020 by Île-de-France, the administrative region Paris belongs to. Mobility as a service will be good for users, but unless Paris finds a way to lure them back into public transit, or at least divert some revenue from shared private transportation back into public infrastructure—last year Bird announced it would help build and maintain protected bike lanes in cities where it operates—e-scooter companies will not contribute to a long-term vision for sustainable mobility.",https://www.wired.com/story/paris-escooters-regulation/
Uber Challenges Los Angeles’s Suspension of Its Scooters,Wall Street Journal,,National,2019,11,14,"Uber Challenges Los Angeles’s Suspension of Its Scooters. Company requests hearing with city officials, buying it more time during which it can continue renting the vehicles. Uber Technologies Inc. has requested a hearing with Los Angeles officials after the city suspended its permit to rent out electric scooters over a data-sharing dispute. The move, made last week, buys Uber more time during which it can continue renting its Jump-branded scooters to customers. The hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet. At the heart of the issue is Los Angeles’s requirement for companies to share real-time information on such rentals. The city says it needs to track the movements of about 39,000 rental scooters and bicycles in order to manage its streets effectively and to ensure companies are sticking to restrictions on the number of vehicles they operate. All seven other dockless scooter providers operating in Los Angeles have complied, city officials note. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation gave Uber 10 days to request the hearing after issuing a temporary suspension Oct. 30. Uber argues the requirements are invasive and could threaten public safety. “By demanding real-time information about people’s movements, LADOT is an outlier among hundreds of cities around the world—and independent privacy experts and advocates raised the alarm more than a year ago that LADOT’s misguided technique poses serious risks to consumer privacy,” an Uber spokeswoman said. The city has said that it anonymizes the data it collects, but privacy advocates and Uber have argued that geolocation data in itself is personally identifiable. The Center for Democracy and Technology, for instance, has suggested that if such data were to be compromised by hackers or misused by officials, it could enable stalking or surveillance. The hearing won’t focus on data-privacy issues. Instead, it will examine whether the Department of Transportation acted properly in issuing the temporary suspension, the department’s general manager, Seleta Reynolds, said in an interview. Compliance with these requirements, she said, was a condition of granting Uber its permit in the first place. “In their defense, they can bring up whatever they would like to explain why they did certain things or did not do certain things. But the parameters of the hearing are really just about whether LADOT acted properly in our regulatory authority by suspending their permit,” Ms. Reynolds said. The Uber hearing will be conducted by an independent officer selected at random from a pool of specialists, who are typically lawyers, city officials said. If the hearing comes down in favor of her department, Ms. Reynolds said, Uber can appeal its suspension to the city’s Transportation Commission, but the department has the right to disagree with its findings. The Transportation Commission is a board of appointed officials from the public, private and academic sectors that has regulatory powers over vehicles for hire and that reviews proposed ordinances affecting city streets, such as speed limits, among other areas. Out of eight dockless scooter providers in Los Angeles, including Lyft Inc. and Bird Rides Inc., Uber is the only company that hasn’t complied with the real-time data-sharing requirements of the Mobility Data Specification, an open-source platform built by Lacuna Technologies Inc.’s Ellis & Associates business, city staff and others. Ms. Reynolds said she agrees there needs to be more discussion about data privacy, although she disagrees with Uber’s assertions. The problem with a wider conversation, she said, is that the topic of data-sharing for scooters is unlikely to attract a representative audience at a public town-hall meeting. Instead, the city is creating an advisory board, comprising community organizations and other stakeholders, which will discuss the technical aspects of the data-sharing platform and publish its findings. Ultimately, she said, these findings could form the basis for a set of standards governing data collection and usage that could apply to both the public and private sectors. This is important, as many cities consider the Los Angeles system a template they can use to manage services including those provided by Uber and Lyft, standardizing such data transfers rather than developing individual systems. Over a dozen major U.S. cities are members of the Open Mobility Foundation, which governs the development of the MDS platform for use beyond Los Angeles. “In the past, what happened is that private companies were able to pick cities up and pit us against each other, because we weren’t really coordinating very well,” she said.

Lyft is pulling its scooters from cities across the US,CNN,,National,2019,11,16,"Lyft is pulling its scooters from cities across the US. Electric scooter enthusiasts in Nashville, San Antonio and Columbus, Ohio, will have one less brand to ride starting next week. Lyft is ending its scooter service in six cities, the company said in a statement provided to CNN Business. The decision has resulted in 20 layoffs in its bikes and scooters team, which consists of about 400 people. In Atlanta, the e-scooter end date is November 23, according to a message sent to customers. ""We're choosing to focus on the markets where we can have the biggest impact. We're continuing to invest in growing our bike and scooter business but will shift resources away from smaller markets and toward bigger opportunities,"" the company said in its statement. The other cities losing their Lyft scooters are Dallas and the Phoenix area. The decision in Atlanta left customers like Ryan Colburn, a master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology, disappointed. Colburn has ridden Lyft scooters a few times a week and used to ride the Jump electric bicycles before the Uber subsidiary pulled them out of the city. ""Lyft scooters were the next best thing, and I loved riding them. They have the best acceleration and braking of any other scooter I've tried here,"" Colburn told CNN through Twitter. ""For me, so many of the trips I need to make are too far to walk most of the time, but also a bit too short for me to want to deal with my car. They are especially nice when going up the hills here in Atlanta (something that isn't fun on a normal bike). I'm super sad to see them leave. Other scooters aren't as nice to use or are more expensive."" Scooters have been a controversial topic around the country following reports of injuries and deaths. Since May, four people have been killed in Atlanta while riding an e-scooter, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The city has since imposed a nighttime e-scooter and e-bike ban and prohibited the issuance of additional scooter permits.

Lyft will end e-scooter operations in 6 cities and lay off around 20 staff members,Business Insider,,National,2019,11,18,"Lyft will end e-scooter operations in 6 cities and lay off around 20 staff members. US mobility giant Lyft will end e-scooter operations in six US markets and lay off around 20 staff members in its bike and scooter department, according to TechCrunch. The company said the end of its scooter operations in the impacted markets — Nashville, San Antonio, Atlanta, Phoenix, Dallas, and Columbus — is part of a strategy shift to focus only on areas with the greatest opportunity for growth. This shift comes as the company is aiming to be profitable — Lyft posted a $464 million net loss in Q3 2019. Lyft isn't alone in refining the scope of its micromobility operations as the industry faces hurdles to success. Earlier this month, Lime notified Tallahassee, Florida that it was pulling out of the city's e-scooter pilot program. And in September, Uber confirmed plans to remove its dockless electric bikes from Atlanta and San Diego, while it pulled out of Dallas and San Antonio in June. Meanwhile, e-scooter company Gotcha announced its exit from Atlanta in June, citing a saturated market. Here are two reasons why companies may pull out of some markets: Shifting local regulations can threaten to upend operations. For instance, in Nashville, the city's mayor proposed an e-scooter ban following a fatal e-scooter accident. While the mayor's proposal failed, the city council did end up limiting e-scooter deployments in August 2019. The same month, Atlanta banned the use of e-scooters and electric bikes between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. following several fatal nighttime accidents. Not every market is right for e-scooters or dockless bikes, which can lead to poor unit economics. For instance, suburban or rural areas could limit the number of rides made using a scooter each day, as distances between locations are farther, likely requiring units to be recharged, serviced, or relocated more often. Additionally, operating scooters in markets with harsh climates, like severe cold, can increase the wear and tear on a scooter or bike and even limit their use to certain seasons. Automakers interested in microbolility should take heed of companies like Lyft reallocating their resources. Micromobility is attractive to automakers because it enables them to drive revenue from consumers who may not be able or want to own a car. In July 2019, US automaker Ford revealed it would expand the presence of its e-scooter company, called Spin, with 15,000 new scooters in eight cities. Meanwhile, German automaker BMW unveiled its personal e-scooter solution in May 2019, and auto giant Volkswagen has at least six separate e-scooter or e-bike products in development across its subsidiary brands. Automakers should take note of what markets micromobility players are entering or abandoning to identify what works and what doesn't before expanding their presence in the growing segment — in the US alone, consumers took 84 million shared micromobilty trips, over twice the number taken in 2017.",https://www.businessinsider.com/lyft-pulls-escooters-from-6-cities-2019-11
Bird will give you free scooter rides if you take a selfie while wearing a helmet,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,11,19,"Bird will give you free scooter rides if you take a selfie while wearing a helmet. It’s the company’s plan B to improve safety. Bird says it will start giving out free rides to customers who take selfies of themselves wearing helmets in an effort to promote safety while riding electric scooters. How to get customers, who often take scooter rides impulsively, to wear helmets has been one of the more intractable problems of the shared electric scooter industry. According to a recent study, only one in 190 people injured while riding e-scooters was wearing a helmet. Researchers calculated that there were 20 individuals injured per 100,000 e-scooter trips taken during a three-month period in Austin, Texas. As scooter companies grow, the need to ensure that customers are taking their own safety into account has become a central challenge. Initially, Bird tried to attack this problem by simply giving away free helmets in the cities in which it operates. The company ended up giving away 75,000 helmets over the last 18 months alone, but it found that these pop-up events didn’t result in increased helmet adoption (and likely were costing Bird a hefty sum). So its plan B is to offer credit to customers who demonstrate helmet use. The Santa Monica, California-based company is updating its app to invite customers to submit a photo of themselves wearing a helmet at the end of each trip. People can also post their selfies on social media using the hashtag #BirdHelmetSelfie. Bird says it will use machine learning to successfully recognize which riders are really wearing helmets. “Riders who demonstrate helmet usage will receive incentives such as future ride credits,” the company says. The debate over helmet use is heating up after a federal safety panel recommended mandatory helmet laws for all 50 states. While helmets have been shown to reduce traumatic brain injuries, requiring their use has also been proven to discourage cycling. Most experts agree that the best way to protect bike and scooter riders is by building protected infrastructure, reducing car speeds, and supporting policies that improve road safety for all users.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972447/bird-free-scooter-rides-selfie-wearing-helmet
16-Year-Old Scooter Rider Killed by Tow Truck in New Jersey,New York Times,,National,2019,11,21,"16-Year-Old Scooter Rider Killed by Tow Truck in New Jersey. The accident in Elizabeth comes just a few weeks after the city started a shared scooter program. A 16-year-old boy became the first person killed while riding a shared electric scooter in New Jersey when he collided with a tow truck in Elizabeth on Wednesday night. The boy, identified by a city official as Nelson Miranda Gomez, was riding one of 150 Lime scooters that were made available for public rental in Elizabeth just three weeks ago, according to the city’s mayor, J. Christian Bollwage. The mayor said a large tow truck was making a right turn from Elizabeth Avenue onto Spring Street at about 8:05 p.m. when it struck the boy, a local resident, who died shortly after the collision. The driver, who stayed at the scene and called for help, has not been charged, a city official said. Even as scooter-sharing programs have become increasingly popular across the country, deaths are still relatively rare. In Nashville, city officials ordered Lime and several other scooter providers, including the ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft, to reduce their fleets by half after a rider who had been drinking was killed in a collision with a car. In Elizabeth, the minimum legal age for riding the scooter is 18, but they are available throughout the city and can be unlocked by anybody with a smartphone. The mayor said in an interview that the City Council would discuss potential changes to the scooter program to make it safer, or possibly decide to terminate altogether. Mr. Bollwage said the council had unanimously agreed to try the pilot program, but “tragedies always have a way of stimulating an emotional response to an issue.” He added: “This is the first issue we’ve had, but it’s naturally the worst issue you can have. It’s just tragic.” The mayor said there had been more than 15,000 rides on the Lime scooters, which can be parked anywhere at the end of a ride, in Elizabeth in the first three weeks. He said the city had approved as many as 400 scooters, but only 150 were available for rides so far. The city shares in the revenue from the scooters, which cost $1 per ride, plus 20 cents per minute. Russell Murphy, a spokesman for Lime, said the death was the first involving one of the company’s scooters in New Jersey. “We are absolutely devastated by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the victim’s family and friends during this incredibly difficult time,” Mr. Murphy said. “We are in close contact with Elizabeth officials and stand ready to assist in any way we can.” In late October, Elizabeth became the third city in New Jersey to offer a shared scooter program when it started a six-month pilot program with Lime. Hoboken started a pilot program in May that ended on Wednesday amid a heated debate about the safety of the scooters. Scooters will no longer be available while the City Council decides whether to renew the program. Several riders were arrested or given tickets in Hoboken for riding while drunk or riding on sidewalks. On the final day of the pilot, a scooter rider had a minor collision with a car that was making a right turn off Hoboken’s main artery, Washington Street, a city official said. In August, Asbury Park, N.J., started a 10-month pilot program with SPIN, a company that competes with Lime. Lawmakers in New York passed legislation this summer that would allow the use of electric scooters everywhere in the state, including New York City, except in Manhattan. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has until years end to sign that bill into law. At least one community leader in Elizabeth wants the scooters off the streets. Salaam Ismail, director of National United Youth Council, a social services agency in Elizabeth, said he was calling every member of the City Council, urging them to suspend the scooter program immediately. Without bike lanes or the providing of helmets, he said, riding the motorized scooters in street traffic was too dangerous, especially if teenagers can gain access to them. “They didn’t think this thing out,” Mr. Ismail said in an interview. “This city is just not equipped for it. Look, New York don’t even want it in Manhattan because it’s too cluttered. It’s the same situation here in Elizabeth.” Correction: Nov. 21, 2019 Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of Nashville’s pilot program.

"E-scooters suddenly appeared everywhere, but now they're riding into serious trouble",CNN,,National,2019,11,22,"E-scooters suddenly appeared everywhere, but now they're riding into serious trouble. Brussels. San Diego. Bogotá. Walk around any major tourist destination these days, and you'll see them. Electric scooters, gliding silently around city center streets, zipping through traffic signals, or abandoned -- lying on the street, propped up against trees or, in some cases, dumped in rivers. Scooter-sharing systems similar to city bike schemes have sprung up in more than 100 cities worldwide as their popularity has grown. But this tiny-wheeled transport revolution could be about to end as quickly as it began. While they've attracted admirers for their convenience and fun, they've also incurred the wrath of those annoyed at having to leap out of people riding across sidewalks or step over scooters lying in their path. There are also mounting safety concerns and questions about environmental claims made about using them. This month, Singapore announced a trial prohibition of e-scooters on sidewalks that could become an all-out ban next year. It took the decision, says Lam Pin Min, senior minister of state for transport, following the death of a cyclist who collided with an e-scooter. Local news reports said one Singapore hospital had reported six deaths of scooter riders in 2019. Meanwhile in France, a sidewalk scooter ban was enforced in September, three months after a rider was hit by a truck and killed. In the UK, scooters are also banned from all public roads, sidewalks and cycle lanes -- although that hasn't stopped them being a regular presence on all three. The UK now insists that retailers including Amazon put safety warnings on packaging, a measure introduced in October, after a YouTube star, Emily Hartridge, was killed riding an e-scooter in London in July. 'Disproportionately affecting' those with disabilities The scooter revolution has been billed as a green way to get around big cities, with rental apps acting in the same way as city bike schemes. You pick them up, pay by the minute and drop them off at your destination. Where some city bikes often have docking stations -- to which the bikes must be returned for the fees to stop -- scooters can be picked up or dropped off anywhere. And while that may be handy -- apps like Lime, Bird and countless local spinoffs have live maps showing users where the nearest scooters are -- it's causing issues for other road users. Simon Minty, a disability and diversity consultant who presents the Ouch disability podcast for the BBC, was in Brussels this summer when he came across abandoned scooters blocking the sidewalks. ""I predict these two wheeled electric scooters will become very annoying,"" he tweeted. ""They seem to be abandoned, in the middle of the pavement, everywhere I go. I saw three from the station to my hotel."" Minty says that a friend who'd been to Paris said the situation in the French capital before the September ban was ""exactly the same."" People with disabilities are ""disproportionately affected,"" he says. ""You're going to hit these, and you'll be absolutely stuffed."" Proponents of scooters say that they're environmentally friendly. ""Cruise past traffic and cut back on CO2 emissions,"" trumpets Bird's website. But an August 2019 paper by researchers from North Carolina State University found that they may not be as green as you'd think. In fact, traveling by scooter has a higher carbon footprint than going by bus or moped -- as well as on a bike or on foot, according to Jeremiah Johnson, an associate professor at NCSU who led the research published in the Environmental Research Letters journal. Instead of looking at scooter carbon footprint per journey, Johnson and his team looked at the entire lifecycle of scooters -- crucial because they are notoriously short-lived, he says, with customers mistreating them. The materials used to make the scooters -- an aluminum frame, lithium battery and rubber wheels -- all result in an environmental burden, he says. As does the manufacturing. ""They have a really short lifetime, especially in this application of them,"" he tells CNN. ""Aluminum doesn't provide much service. They only last several months."" What's more, because users can ditch them wherever they like, rental apps pay third parties to round up the scooters every night, grouping them more sensibly for the morning's customers, he says. ""They receive compensation per scooter, so there'll be folks doing this as a side hustle, students trying to make money -- it's a prime source of income,"" he says. ""It's very competitive and done in a very short window, and they're largely driving their personal cars to pick them up. That's a pretty big share of the impact."" Lime scooters are taken to warehouses each night by a local operations team, said a spokesperson. Senior director at Bird, Caroline Hazlehurst, said that Bird's scooters are collected ""regularly, but not always every day... How we collect them changes from country to country."" But she added: ""Every town and city throughout the world suffers from the same two problems: too many cars creating congestion which in turn leads to poor air quality."" Of course, they also need to be charged overnight. And the final thing to take into account is what method of transport they're replacing. If you're scootering to work instead of driving yourself solo, the scooter is a ""clear environmental win,"" says NCSU's Johnson. But, he says, many people surveyed in Raleigh, where the university is based, said that pre-scooter, they'd cycle or walk to work. While many people in the US drive to work -- and Johnson is clear that ""in moving away from car ownership it's almost certainly a win for environmental performance"" -- in European cities, where public transport is the norm, using a scooter is therefore relatively less green, he says. The upshot? ""Scooters look innocuous but people tend not to think about the unseen cost,"" Johnson says. Hazlehurst says that Bird has changed its scooters from ""consumer grade"" to a ""vastly different"" and ""rugged"" version since they launched. Its ""Bird One"" model now has a lifetime of around 18 months, she said, while its latest model Bird Two can last two years. Lime says that its third generation model is ""demonstrating a lifespan of more than 12 months."" Its spokesperson says that Johnson's study ""raises important issues"" but ""doesn't capture Lime's approach today."" ""We've already taken steps to reduce our environmental impact, including streamlining our charging operations, powering our scooters with 100% renewable energy, offsetting the emissions from fleet vehicles, and establishing a robust repair and reuse program to extend the life cycle of our products,"" the spokesperson said. Where are scooters legal? Rules on e-scooters vary around the world. In the UK, riding one on a road can net users six penalty points on their driving license. Riding them on the sidewalk, cyclepath or footpath is subject to a £300 ($385) fine. A report by the UK House of Commons Library in August suggested that things could change in the future, but a spokesperson for the Department for Transport declined to comment, citing rules around the upcoming UK election. In Paris, while you can ride them on the road, using them on the sidewalk can incur a €135 fine, while dumping them in a doorway, on a crosswalk or in another antisocial place incurs a €35 fine. ""Pavements are only for pedestrians,"" mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted in March this year. Germany approved e-scooter use this year, though not on sidewalks unless in ""exceptional"" circumstances. Bird's Caroline Hazlehurst says that ""especially in Europe, we're seeing cities and countries change laws to specifically allow scooters to operate."" In Sweden, where scooters are classified as bicycles and allowed on sidewalks or footpaths, 241 accidents have been registered this year alone including one death. Tomas Eneroth, the Swedish minister for infrastructure, has called the situation ""a mess."" The law in Spain was changed this year. E-scooters can no longer be used on sidewalks. Additionally, they are banned in Barcelona. Madrid authorities in October refused to grant licenses to ride-sharing companies Bird, Lime and Voi. In the United States, over 100 cities have e-scooters, and Americans took 38.5 million trips on them, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Portland, Oregon, is midway through a year-long trial, following a four-month pilot in 2018. The 2018 program ""raised concerns about people riding e-scooters on sidewalks, in violation of state traffic laws, creating conflict with people walking and people with disabilities,"" says a statement from the Portland Bureau of Transportation. The PBOT will ""evaluate the program"" following the pilot. It used to be illegal to use the scooters in New York City, but a law change in summer 2019 means that you can use your own, if you have one -- although ride-sharing rentals are still banned. And in LA, authorities this month suspended Uber's permit to rent e-scooters because of its failure to share ride-tracking data with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. Seven other companies are licensed to rent scooters in LA though. And in San Francisco, the scooter companies were dubbed ""spoiled brats"" by Aaron Peskin, one of the legislators who voted to clamp down on the companies when they were introduced in 2018. In April 2019, however, the city granted permits to four companies: Jump, Lime, Spin, and Scoot, the last of which had previously been operating. San Diego struggles to cope San Diego has been at the forefront of scooter wars since the machines arrived in February 2018. The city is awash with more than 19,000 scooters, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune -- with almost 15,000 complaints about them to the city authorities over the summer, 3,700 scooters impounded for parking violations, and almost 500 riders receiving traffic tickets. Since April, the city has instated ""corrals"" -- designated parking spots by the roadside for scooters, outlined with paint on the road. Riders can be fined for dumping a scooter on the street in a block that has a corral. In April, the council introduced new restrictions on scooters, including speed limits in pedestrian-heavy places like Balboa Park, and a parking ban in places with speed limits below 8 mph, including beachfront boardwalks and in Little Italy. Council member Barbara Bry, a vocal critic of the scooters, called for a moratorium in July, although it has not been approved. In December, the council will debate banning scooters on the beach boardwalks entirely. ""Throughout the city, I continue to see riders using the sidewalk, multiple riders on one scooter, and scooters strewn about the sidewalks, rather than in designated corrals,"" she tells CNN. ""San Diego was slow to respond when scooters started showing up on our streets. While it has been inactive, other cities like Portland and Santa Monica have issued requests for proposals that include a fee structure, operational standards, data sharing and insurance requirements."" She said the City has ""let a technology overtake us rather than assist and empower our communities with safe and sustainable micro-mobility options,"" and said that ""all of downtown is experiencing cluttered sidewalks."" ""The corrals are overflowing with scooters that leak out into the road and automobile parking spaces,"" she said. The mayor of San Diego was not available for comment. Victims of scooter crashes are cashing in Catherine Lerer, a personal injury attorney based in Santa Monica, where scooters were introduced to the United States, says that over the past 18 months, she's spoken to around 400 victims of scooter injuries -- both riders and pedestrians. She believes them to be more accident-prone than bikes because of their smaller, more solid wheels and a more precarious center of gravity for users. ""It's imperative that cities get ahead of any e-scooter rollout, otherwise they will be hamstrung in terms of regulating the scooters and sanctioning the operators,"" she tells CNN. Authorities should ban nighttime use, sidewalk riding and allowing the scooters on roads that have a speed limit of more than 25 mph, she argues in a list of 25 recommendations. She says authorities should also insist that riders wear helmets, prohibit sidewalk parking, install tech that alerts the companies if a scooter isn't upright, and fit the devices with lights, reflectors, turn signals, kickstands and identification numbers. She says the devices should emit noises that can be heard by nearby pedestrians, to help those with disabilities. For its part, Lime says it is tailoring its scooter roll outs so that they work with specific destinations and urges careful consideration before new legislation is introducted. ""Lime is committed to partnering with cities to build the right shared mobility program for each community,"" a spokesperson said. ""We know the positive impact micromobility can have on communities around the globe... and we're dedicated to collaborating with our city partners to tackle these challenges together. ""We support regulations that promote safety and greater transportation access without stifling innovation or consumer choice."" Scooter fans still keen Despite the issues, though, the enthusiasm of scooter fans show no sign of waning -- and for some, replacing a putative car journey feels like the right thing to do. Cyndi Hutchenson, a copywriter from South Florida, commutes via scooter most days -- a journey of around 10 minutes. She has a monthly pass, costing $15, which allows her 30 minutes of scootering per day. ""I don't have a car, and I don't really want one,"" she says. ""I live downtown, and everything I want to reach is a relatively cheap Uber Pool away, if it's outside scooter limits. And I'm new to the city, so I want to get to know it better. ""I'm conscious of the environmental impact difference of riding an electric scooter versus riding in a car every day. I also know that, were I to have a car, I'd be making more unnecessary trips or traveling farther outside my neighborhood for things I can easily have a range of within a scooter ride ""The buses are not convenient (in terms of timing, cleanliness, safety, and payment methods) in my city and don't even go to my workplace."" The future of e-scooters But as cities continue to clamp down, and the accidents mount up, scootering around the globe might not be free and easy forever. ""I don't want to be a killjoy, they do look a lot of fun,"" says Simon Minty. ""They're exciting, new technology, they mean fewer cars on the roads -- but people have to realize that there's responsibility that comes with them. ""It's not just people with disabilities. Parents with prams, older people -- a whole bundle of people will be affected if we have to navigate round these scooters. ""I don't quite understand how people can just leave them in the street. It just blows my mind a little bit.""",https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/electric-scooter-bans-world/index.html
Why electric scooters are illegal in New York and London,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,11,25,"Why electric scooters are illegal in New York and London. The laws, regulations, and politics working against them. Spend any time in New York or London, and you’ll inevitably come across dozens of people whizzing along each city’s streets on electric scooters. Yet, despite their popularity, e-scooters are technically illegal in both places, and the politicians with the power to change things are in no rush to do so. In London, e-scooters are illegal because of Britain’s national laws, some of which date back to the Victorian era. Meanwhile, in New York City, the legislation exists to legalize them at a state level, but the state governor has yet to sign the bill that would allow electric scooters to officially move in. The situation has left New York City and the UK’s populous capital London in a weird bind when it comes to e-scooters. It’s easy to buy them and start using them on the roads, but any cop who sees you is technically within their right to pull you over. Yet, people continue to buy and use e-scooters in these cities in droves. They’re relatively cheap, they’re easy to ride, and they’re great at getting around congestion. Importantly for cities, they’re also very environmentally friendly compared to making a journey in a car, and their impact on traffic congestion is minimal. Clearly, there’s a need for change in both cities, but local and national regulations need to find a balance. They need to balance the obvious enthusiasm people have for e-scooters and the ambitions of e-scooter rental companies with the need to keep roads safe for scooterists and everyone else who shares the road with them. Join us as we examine what it’s going to take for the situation to change.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20977840/electric-scooters-illegal-law-legislation-micromobility-london-new-york
Scooters vs. People,New York Times,,National,2019,12,2,"Scooters vs. People. Get them off the sidewalks. “A 75-year-old man tripped over an abandoned scooter in San Diego and shattered his knee,” The Washington Post’s Avi Selk has reported. “A 7-year-old boy near Los Angeles reportedly had his teeth knocked out by a scooter rider. A 44-year-old woman was hit by a Bird scooter in a Cincinnati intersection.” Peter Holley, also of The Post, has written: “There are no official numbers illustrating how frequently pedestrians are injured by scooters, but doctors interviewed in five cities say badly injured pedestrians are showing up in trauma centers multiple times a week.” And Wally Ghurabi, medical director of the Nethercutt Emergency Center in Southern California, told Holley: “I’ve seen pedestrians injured by scooters with broken hips, multiple bone fractures, broken ribs and joint injuries and soft tissue injuries like lacerations and deep abrasions.” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] More weeks than not, I need to move out the way of a speeding scooter on a Washington sidewalk. Officially, downtown Washington doesn’t allow electric scooters on sidewalks, but the law is widely ignored and rarely enforced. “There’s no cop on the beat,” Steven Reichert, a Washington resident, told WJLA, a local television station. Amid everything else going on, I’m not going to claim that the dangerous use of electric scooters — which began appearing in major cities in 2017 — is the country’s biggest problem. But it’s at least a problem we can easily fix. Sidewalks simply are not a place for rapidly moving, heavy objects, be they mopeds, bicycles or scooters. Scooters belong in the street or, even better, in dedicated bicycle lanes where those exist. For more … An American Medical Association analysis: “Scooter injuries documented in this study were mostly minor, but could also be severe and costly, with 6.0% of patients admitted to the hospital, and 0.8% admitted to the intensive care unit.” After a fatal accident in August, the Denver City Council banned scooters from operating on sidewalks unless they are traveling less than six miles per hour. Arlington County, in suburban Virginia, has set the same speed limit and also mandated that scooter riders use bike lanes where one is available. (I worry that places with speed limits won’t enforce them, as seems to be happening in Denver.) Many claims of scooter manufacturers deserve extreme skepticism. They seem to be marketing more than anything. Bird, for example, has claimed that its devices can reduce pedestrian deaths by reducing the number of cars on the road. But as CityLab’s Sarah Holder has reported, it remains unclear whether the scooters are any safer than more traditional modes of transportation. Other claims scooter companies have made about their devices — that using them is eco-friendly, for example — appear to be unsupported, as well. “Yes, there are good arguments for these vehicles,” Margaret Renkl wrote in The Times. “Nevertheless, the arguments in favor of electric scooters are nothing compared to the problems they cause.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/opinion/electric-scooters.html
"Singapore Hits the Brakes On Electric Scooters, But That Doesn’t Stop Renegade Riders",Wall Street Journal,,National,2019,12,6,"Singapore Hits the Brakes On Electric Scooters, But That Doesn’t Stop Renegade Riders. New law confines devices to designated bicycle routes and a few mixed-use paths; Fans are figuring out workarounds. SINGAPORE—Sarah Alatas’s morning commute used to be a breezy, 20-minute zip along tree-lined lanes on her Electrowolf Cyclone—a lightweight, foldable electric scooter that can whisk her across 50 miles of pavement on a single battery charge. But since the Singapore government banned e-scooters on the city’s sidewalks last month and instructed patrolling transport officers to keep a lookout for errant riders, her mornings are more like elaborate scenes from a spy thriller. First come the phone calls from close friends and e-scooting neighbors giving her the all-clear for an immediate half-mile radius. Next, the texts pour in on the messaging app Telegram where hundreds of fellow aficionados use special group chats to share maps and detailed instructions on how to avoid detection. Then she sets out, like a fugitive, throwing a paranoid glance over each shoulder each time she turns a corner. “We’re all in this together; if anybody spots an officer they alert everybody,” said Ms. Alatas, a 22-year-old security guard at a condominium. She said she sometimes gets a thrill out of knowing the officer positioned at the mouth of an underpass has no idea she’s whizzing by on a sidewalk overhead after a tip-off. “We’re not going to stop scootering,” Ms. Alatas said. “We’re just going to find another way.” In November, Singapore hit the brakes on e-scooters, confining them to designated bicycle routes and a few mixed-use paths where people walk, run, bike, e-scoot, unicycle and use hoverboards. Scooters have swarmed city streets and sidewalks around the world in recent years as an economical and environmentally friendly way to get around, but officials in Singapore said the sudden surge has put pedestrians in peril. The government said that despite its “significant efforts,” such as lowering the speed limit and banning models that don’t meet international safety certifications, errant riding and accidents remained on the rise. Other countries have faced similar struggles with the ubiquitous devices. France banned their use on city sidewalks in October, confining them to bicycle lanes or roads, where they can be ridden alongside cars, trucks and motorcycles. Regulations are still in the works across the U.S., where e-scooter makers have lobbied for legalization. New York is close to amending its traffic law to grant e-scooter riders similar rights to drivers of vehicles. Under Singapore’s new rules, riders must dismount and walk, sometimes well over half a mile in the punishing heat, to the nearest government-sanctioned path. For now, lawbreakers are being let off with a warning, though riders say officers have begun recording names of offenders in some areas. Once the ban comes into full effect in January, those caught e-scooting on sidewalks could be fined up to nearly $1,500 and imprisoned for up to three months. “When I heard the news I was like, ‘Man, no way!’ and my kids were like, ‘Nooooooooooooo!’ ” said 38-year-old Zumba instructor Domenica Sarka. “I guess there were a few people who got hurt. The government was just like: done.” Mrs. Sarka switched to a more primitive kick scooter, without a motor, which is allowed on sidewalks. At first she considered an electric bike, but found it too bulky and ill-suited to her active lifestyle, viewing it as more suitable for senior citizens. She opted for the folding kick-scooter model recommended most by the online scooter community, but she said it leaves her heart “only about half full.” Some riders, like Fazilah Jamal, tried making the switch to a bicycle but found it impractical. Ms. Jamal, who at 25 years old had never before ridden a pedal bike, ended up with a leg injury upon her very first try. Pointing to the wound on her left calf, she said there are people like her who “really, actually, really just can’t ride a bike.” The e-scooter has divided public opinion in Singapore, with many questioning the new rules of the road. Ron Tay, a scooter retailer who deals in both the kick and electric varieties, said there are “just a few bad apples” causing undue reputational damage to scooter users everywhere. “I’ve seen a guy walk right into a pole because he was looking at his phone. Even walking can be dangerous if you don’t do it right,” Mr. Tay said. For the uninitiated, an electric scooter is an L-shaped apparatus with two wheels and a narrow deck with handlebars on the front. But the ban in Singapore is broad, outlawing all electric “personal mobility devices,” or PMDs, unless it is a mobility aid ridden by someone with a physical disability. That includes an array of modified vehicles, some resembling miniaturized motorcycles, others looking more like skateboards with seats. Singapore’s wide, gently sloped sidewalks proved to be a conducive habitat for PMDs. According to government figures, there are nearly 100,000 registered PMDs in Singapore, many used for commuting to work and school, or to and from subway stations in expansive residential neighborhoods. Also banned on sidewalks are “seated e-scooters,” a preferred mode of transport among the freelance workers who deliver food to the city’s apartments and office towers. The Singapore government has set aside roughly $5.1 million to help them switch to conventional or power-assisted bicycles. Edwin Lim, a 40-year-old building manager, admits he became something of an e-scooter addict. For him, one scooter wasn’t enough; he kept buying new ones—faster, more stylish models—until he ended up with eight. “When this thing came out, I was so amazed, like, this is something very new to me,” Mr. Lim said. “So I just kept getting new ones.” Now he is giving up his collection piece-by-piece, trading in each scooter for a government voucher worth a fraction of the thousands he spent over the past three years. “Yeah, it’s sad,” he said as he watched a team of e-recyclers haul away scooter number five. Opponents of the ban have flocked to local government meetings and formed online communities where they seek out loopholes in the law. In one video shared widely on social media, a rider zips across a patch of manicured lawn between a street and sidewalk saying, “Footpath cannot, grass can!” After online commenters warned that this, too, was an illegal place to scoot, a second video turned up of a rider coasting across a covered culvert, claiming the government hadn’t expressly outlawed riding on drains. In another desperate and dubious attempt to circumvent the law, a young man was filmed riding on top of an awning-like shelter built to cover the length of a sidewalk. He was promptly arrested after the video went viral. “What he did was bad for our cause,” said Ms. Alatas, who believes scooter riders will one day convince the government to change its mind. “We’re fighting the long fight.”",https://www.wsj.com/articles/singapore-hits-the-brakes-on-electric-scooters-but-that-doesnt-stop-renegade-riders-11575649591
Scooter Companies at Odds With Atlanta Over Impounds,U.S. News,,National,2019,12,7,"Scooter Companies at Odds With Atlanta Over Impounds. Atlanta is now charging fees to transportation companies when it picks up their abandoned or improperly parked rental scooters. Atlanta is now charging fees to transportation companies when it picks up their abandoned or improperly parked rental scooters. City officials say they're no longer simply releasing the scooters without receiving impound fees. Public Works Commissioner James Jackson Jr. ordered that the fees be collected. The change was made after it was revealed last month that the city failed to collect at least $200,000 in scooter impound fees since summer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. But one scooter company says the city has provided inconsistent evidence the impounded devices were illegally parked. The latest dust-up between the city and the companies raises questions about how the Atlanta Department of Public Works collects the scooters and informs companies of violations. City Council members questioned Jackson last week about the process of documenting illegally parked scooters and raised concerns that companies received incorrect violations. Jackson acknowledged the city had initial issues with enforcement because the team tasked with collecting scooters — the Solid Waste Education Enforcement Team — is also responsible for enforcing sanitation regulations such as illegal dumping, recycling, and solid waste disposal. Councilman Amir Farokhi said the city needs to make sure the impoundment process is set up in a way that is legally sound and enforces the rules the city has in place. “I think it’s a reasonable expectation, whether you’re getting a speeding ticket as a driver or you have a scooter that runs afoul of city law, that the violation is documented and that proof is provided to the vendor in order to ask for a payment,” Farokhi told the newspaper. City officials are still working on scooter legislation to present to council members. An updated plan is to be presented to the city council's transportation committee on Dec. 11.",https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2019-12-07/scooter-companies-at-odds-with-atlanta-over-impounds
"Unicorn, e-scooter startup from co-creator of Tile, shuts down with no money for refunds",The Verge,Vox,National,2019,12,7,"Unicorn, e-scooter startup from co-creator of Tile, shuts down with no money for refunds. ‘I am upset he basically robbed everyone of his customers and is closing without delivering any scooters.’ Unicorn, the electric scooter startup from the co-creator of gadget tracker Tile, is shutting down operations after blowing all its cash on Facebook and Google ads but only receiving 350 orders for its glossy white e-scooters, it claims. In an email to customers, the company says it lacks the resources to deliver any of its $699 two-wheelers, and won’t be issuing refunds “as we are completely out of funding.” In a remorseful email, Unicorn CEO Nick Evans said the company had “totally failed as a business” and has also “spread the cost of this failure to you, the early customers that believed in us.” Unicorn emerged six months ago as part of a new crop of scooter startups hoping to capitalize on the popularity of dockless rental services like Bird and Lime, while also pitching itself as an affordable alternative to shared scooters. In addition to having a striking profile — the all-white look was really something — the scooter was loaded with a lot of high-tech bells and whistles, like GPS tracking and smartphone-enabled locking. Naturally it included integration with Tile, Evans’ other company, which uses Bluetooth to track lost items, like a wallet, keys, or phone. But now Unicorn is no more. The company claims it sunk all its money into advertising and marketing, as well as loan repayments and other expenses, with little leftover for production and deliveries. Evans wrote: We could have continued moving forward and taking more orders and that would continue to fund the business, and if we did that might have been able to deliver the product, but we also may have not been able to sell enough Unicorns, so by doing that we would be risking more people’s orders. So we made the very, very difficult decision to stop. A large portion of the revenue went toward paying for Facebook ads to bring traffic to the site. A portion also went to our manufacturer in the form of a down payment to build the scooters, but unfortunately that down payment cannot be redeemed for a portion of the scooters that we were planning to order. Unfortunately, the cost of the ads were just too expensive to build a sustainable business. And as the weather continued to get colder throughout the US and more scooters from other companies came on to the market, it became harder and harder to sell Unicorns, leading to a higher cost for ads and fewer customers. The company is working on selling its remaining assets in order to give partial refunds, but Evans warns that even this is “looking unlikely.” “We are so, so very sorry,” he concludes. Customers, as you can imagine, are pissed. “I am upset he basically robbed everyone of his customers and is closing without delivering any scooters,” Rebecca Buchholtz wrote in an email to The Verge. “This was my daughters Christmas gift and now I cannot get her any gift.” “I find it shocking that someone like Nick Evans who has name recognition and clout in the tech community due to Tile, would operate in such a fraudulent way,” wrote Matt Furhman. Another customer, who said he is now out $998 after ordering two Unicorn scooters, called Evans “a thief.” Customers are advised to contact their credit card companies and dispute the charges from Unicorn. In an email to The Verge, Evans said the company had received only around 350 orders. “I feel horribly guilty that we left people with no scooters and no refunds,” he said. “We are working on something, but, yes, this seems unlikely.” Unicorn isn’t the only electric mobility startup to fall on hard times. Inboard Technology, an electric skateboard startup from Santa Cruz, California, is currently liquidating its intellectual property and assets after attempting to pivot to electric scooters. All 24 employees have been laid off. Other startups appear to have found some success through a more old-fashioned method of marketing: celebrity endorsements. Unagi’s e-scooter apparently is a hit with musicians like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, Halsey, Steve Aoki and teen pop megastar Billie Eilish — which has helped it raise $3.5 million in venture capital. The scooter boom has been uneven for many startups. Big companies like Bird and Lime were able to stay afloat despite an unprofitable business model thanks to large infusions of capital from investors. But terrible unit economics, and the seasonal nature of the business, has made it difficult for smaller startups to gain a foothold. Companies like Unicorn, which sought to partner with China’s Segway/Ninebot on manufacturing (and whose Segway ES2 the scooter closely resembles), find themselves facing enormous upfront costs that are difficult to recoup without a swell of customer preorders. It’s also an example of how difficult it is for scooter companies who just take Chinese-made vehicles, paint them and give them a new badge, and some fancier add-ons, and then try to sell it in the US at a markup.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/7/21000094/unicorn-electric-scooter-shut-down-refund-tile
Today in Christmas miracles: a failed electric scooter company is getting bailed out,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,12,23,"Today in Christmas miracles: a failed electric scooter company is getting bailed out. Unicorn was going out of business with no money for refunds, until rival Unagi rode to the rescue. It’s a Christmas micromobility miracle! Failed scooter business Unicorn is getting bailed out by rival company Unagi, after Unicorn had to shut down recently without any money leftover for refunds. David Hyman, CEO of Unagi, told The Verge that he can offer a $1,000 Unagi electric scooter to any of the 350 people who bought Unicorn scooters. Nick Evans, CEO of Unicorn and co-creator of gadget tracker Tile, confirmed the deal, and said he will offer refunds to anyone who doesn’t want the Unagi scooter and just wants their money back. “We put together a creative solution,” Evans said. “I’ll be paying out of pocket personally to get this done, and it’s been pretty challenging, but I definitely want to do right by everyone.” “It will cost us some money,” Hyman said, “but it’s some Christmas good will too.” Unicorn emerged last summer as part of a new crop of e-scooter startups hoping to capitalize on the popularity of dockless rental services like Bird and Lime. It pitched itself as an affordable alternative to shared scooters. Unicorn’s all-white vehicles were rebranded Segway ES2 scooters with some high-tech add-ons, including integration with Tile, Evans’ other company, which uses Bluetooth to track lost items, like wallets, keys, or phones. The Unicorn scooters were priced at $699, which is about $100 more than the ES2. The problem was not enough people wanted to buy one, according to Evans. “We put out a scooter that was not interesting to people,” he said. “You’ve got to put out something really interesting.” In an email sent to customers earlier this month, Evans said he spent all the money on advertising and marketing, as well as loan repayments and other expenses. That meant there was little leftover for production and deliveries. The company would have to shut down without any money leftover for refunds. “We started Unicorn to make peoples’ lives easier,” Evans said, “and we absolutely did the opposite.” Customers were irate, calling Evans a “thief,” a “fraud,” and accusing him of ruining their holidays. For his part, Evans says it was the “toughest two weeks” of his career. “I am a Grinch,” he admits. Unagi has managed to avoid the same pitfalls that have befallen Unicorn. It’s $1,000 electric scooter is based on a Chinese-made prototype call SWAN that never went into production. Hyman took over the rights to the design globally and funded it to completion. It’s also apparently a big hit with musicians like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, Halsey, Steve Aoki and teen pop megastar Billie Eilish — which has helped Hyman raise $3.5 million in venture capital cash. Hyman said that Evans reached out to him a month ago over LinkedIn to talk about the scooter business. “He said it looked like we were kicking ass, and that he wished he could say the same,” Hyman said. A few weeks later, he learned that Unicorn would be folding. Hyman thought maybe he would buy Unicorn’s domain name and then reroute customers to Unagi’s website. But after further discussion they arrived at a different arrangement. First, Evans would wire an undisclosed sum into Hyman’s account. (Neither Hyman nor Evans would say how much.) Then, customers who bought a Unicorn scooter can choose one of two options: a free Unagi scooter or a full refund. “I want this to end up with people better off than if they’d got a Unicorn scooter,” Evans said. Hyman says he risks pissing off the several thousand people who bought an Unagi scooter at full price, but it was worth to spread a little holiday cheer. “Here comes Hanukkah Harry on the electric scooter,” he said.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035846/unicorn-unagi-electric-scooter-bailout-price-deal
E-bikes show distinct pattern of severe injuries,Reuters,,National,2019,12,25,"E-bikes show distinct pattern of severe injuries. E-bikes and electric scooters are becoming increasingly popular in the United States, but the powered bikes carry a higher risk of severe injuries than traditional bicycles and a different pattern of injury risks compared with scooters, a recent study finds. The authors analyzed emergency department data collected from 2000 to 2017 by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission’s National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), on injuries involving all three types of vehicles. While people riding e-bikes were more likely to suffer internal injuries and be hospitalized compared to the other riders, powered scooter users had higher rates of concussion. E-bike injuries were also more than three times as likely to involve a collision with a pedestrian than either scooter or traditional bike injuries, the researchers report in the journal Injury Prevention. “We don’t know a lot about the overall risks and benefits of electric-powered scooters and e-bikes,” Charles DiMaggio, the study’s lead author, said in an email. Most significantly, the study found injuries from e-bikes in particular were more serious, said DiMaggio, who directs the injury research program in the division of trauma and surgical critical care at NYU Langone Health in New York City. Of more than 245 million injuries reported in the study period, 130,797 involved powered-scooter accidents, accounting for 5.3 per 10,000 U.S. emergency department injuries. There were 3,075 e-bike injuries, or 0.13 per 10,000. In addition, about 9.4 million pedal bicycle injuries accounted for 385.4 per 10,000 of all emergency department injuries. People injured by e-bikes were older, averaging 31.9 years old compared with 29.4 years with powered scooters and 25.2 years with traditional bikes. Indeed, the largest proportion of people involved in e-bike accidents were in the 18-44 and 45-64 age groups, the authors note. Ten-to-14-year-olds made up the largest group of those injured with powered scooters. Males were more likely to be injured overall, accounting for 83.3% of e-bike injuries, 60% with powered scooters and 72.4% with pedal bicycles. Powered scooter accidents were nearly three times more likely to result in concussions than e-bike injuries, and more likely to result in fractures. But 17% of e-bike accident victims suffered internal injuries compared to about 7.5% for both powered scooters and pedal bikes. “With the power assist engaged, e-bikes are capable of speeds well over 20 miles an hour,” DiMaggio pointed out. “By contrast, average speeds for more traditional bikes like the New York City (rental) Citi Bikes are less than 10 miles an hour. This near-doubling of potential speeds may be why e-bike injuries can be more serious,” he said. This, and the lack of proper biking infrastructure. Anne Lusk, a research scientist at Harvard Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who has worked on bicycle environments for 38 years, said the study findings could be used to inform how to design the built-environment to increase safety for e-bike and scooter users, cyclists, pedestrians and car drivers. “Climate change has been elevated to emergency status, and solutions include encouraging people to walk and bike,” Lusk said. “But, the biking environment is not safe.” For example, Lusk said, in the absence of bike lanes, powered-scooter users were riding on sidewalks and roads. There is potential for greener alternatives to traditional transportation, DiMaggio said. “With that potential comes the need to introduce them in a safe and responsible manner, asking questions about possible need for urban design and built environment modifications like docking stations or dedicated lanes, policy changes mandating helmets and education initiatives.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebike-injuries-idUSKBN1YT0MV
Electric bikes and scooters will stay illegal in New York thanks to Governor Cuomo,The Verge,Vox,National,2019,12,26,"Electric bikes and scooters will stay illegal in New York thanks to Governor Cuomo. He just vetoed a bill that was overwhelmingly passed in June. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has vetoed a bill that would have made electric scooters and bikes legal in the state, citing the lack of a mandatory helmet requirement and other safety concerns. The veto means e-bikes and e-scooters will continue to remain technically illegal across the state, and will further delay any adoption of popular (if polarizing) shared mobility services like Lime or Bird. The bill to legalize e-bikes and e-scooters was passed in June with overwhelming support, clearing the state Senate by a 56-6 margin and the state Assembly by a 137-4 margin. But state lawmakers reportedly waited to send the bill to Cuomo until this week out of concern that he would try to stand in the way of the proposal. Cuomo has voiced support for legalizing e-bikes and e-scooters in the past, but reportedly soured on the bill after he was criticized by one of its co-sponsors earlier this year. While the bill would have broadly legalized both modes of transportation across the state, it was also designed to give cities control over e-bike and e-scooter sharing services. Cities would have been allowed to use permits as a tool to control the influx of these sharing companies, which would help prevent them from being inundated like some other cities around the world. It also would have given these local governments leverage to help negotiate their own regulations around shared e-scooters and e-bikes. Crucially, the bill would have helped take pressure off food delivery workers in New York City, many of whom use e-bikes to get around despite technically being illegal. Instead, those workers will continue to be subjected to $500 fines, confiscations, and occasional NYPD enforcement sweeps that at best feel like dog-and-pony shows and at worst unfairly target these workers. Nily Rozic, a New York State Assemblywoman from Queens, and one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a statement that Cuomo’s veto represents a “missed opportunity” to “deliver economic justice for thousands of delivery workers across New York City, and bring safe, viable options to transit deserts across the state.” Phil Jones, the senior government relations director at Lime, called the news “disappointing” in a statement, but said he’s “hopeful that the administration will work swiftly with legislative leaders to improve mobility for all New Yorkers early in the New Year.” “Governor Cuomo has been a strong advocate for innovative and sustainable mobility options, and in the upcoming session, he should make New York a national leader for alternative transportation,” Jones said. “Cities around the world are embracing e-scooters as an environmentally-friendly, inexpensive way to get around, especially in transit deserts. New Yorkers are ready,” a spokesperson for Bird said in an email. “We are encouraged with the overwhelming support we received from the legislature and from the environmental community. We look forward to bringing micro-mobility choices to New Yorkers next year.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21038257/electric-bikes-scooters-veto-illegal-new-york-andrew-cuomo-ban
"I rode an electric scooter from every company operating in LA, and saw exactly why American cities aren't ready for them",Business Insider,,National,2019,12,29,"I rode an electric scooter from every company operating in LA, and saw exactly why American cities aren't ready for them. Review Electric scooters are a polarizing new mode of transportation that is taking over American cities. I rode electric scooters for the first time during a trip to Los Angeles, and my experience was harrowing, thrilling, and freeing. Ultimately, scooters became my new favorite mode of transportation. I tried all the brands I saw, including Lime, Uber, Lyft, and Bird. Of the scooters I tried, Lyft's was by far my favorite. However, my experience also taught me that the public safety infrastructure for riders and those who share the road with them needs to be built before scooters can fulfill their revolutionary potential.

Electric cars, electric bikes, and now electric scooters? Scooters are a staple of childhood. Many a '90s kid fondly remembers scooting about on their Razor scooters before coming home to a snack of flavor-blasted X-treme cheddar Goldfish and maybe some sliced apples. So it's not astonishing that when electric scooters entered the scene, they generated confusion and ridicule as well as enthusiasm. No one asked for electric scooters. We were content with our buses and our trains and our cars, and some of us with our bikes. But then, the electric scooter quietly slipped onto our streets. They proliferated in our urban spaces with the promise of a mode of transportation that was more personal, eco-friendly, and fun. But with new mobility, they also brought new danger. Urban spaces aren't built for electric scooters, but they're filled with them anyway, leading to numerous accidents, injuries, and deaths. As a regular subway rider, I'm pretty nervous about how I move about in public spaces. I refuse to ride bikes in cities because I'm afraid of getting hit by a car. Driving scares me. I have a driver's license, but I've never owned a car. But on a recent trip to Los Angeles, I refused to rent a car and found myself without much in the way of public transit. As a result, I used scooters to make distances meet.

"Electric scooter injuries in the U.S. climb to nearly 40,000 in four years",USA Today,USA Today,National,2020,1,9,"Electric scooter injuries in the U.S. climb to nearly 40,000 in four years. Electric scooter injuries have surged along with their popularity in the United States, nearly tripling over four years, researchers said in a study published Wednesday. Nearly 40,000 broken bones, head injuries, cuts and bruises resulting from scooter accidents were treated in U.S. emergency rooms from 2014 through 2018, the research showed. The scooter injury rate among the general U.S. population climbed from 6 per 100,000 to 19 per 100,000. Most occurred in riders aged 18 to 34, and most injured riders weren’t hospitalized. For the study published in JAMA Surgery, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed U.S. government data on nonfatal injuries treated in emergency rooms. “Improved rider safety measures and regulation” are clearly needed, the researchers said. Media reports have linked the stand-up electric scooters with more than a dozen U.S. deaths within the past few years. The trend follows the emergence of rental companies in cities around the world that let customers rent scooters through smartphone apps and drop them off anywhere in the same city. Some cities have adopted nighttime bans and other restrictions amid rising injuries and complaints about scooters traveling or parked on sidewalks. “Scooters promote active commuting,” could help spur wider public transit use and could lead to less traffic congestion, said lead author Dr. Benjamin Breyer. “We hope to raise awareness that riders should wear helmets and ride safely.”",https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/01/09/electric-scooter-injuries-sent-nearly-40-000-u-s-er/4421041002/

Those cities include: Atlanta; Phoenix, Ariz.; San Diego, Calif.; San Antonio, Texas; Linz, Austria; Bogota, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Montevideo, Uruguay; Lima, Peru; Puerto Vallarta, Mexico; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and São Paulo, Brazil. ""While the vast majority of our 120+ markets have adopted micromobility transportation solutions quickly and are profitable, there are select communities throughout the world where micromobility has evolved more slowly,"" Bao wrote.

E-scooters are leaving people with disabilities behind. Lime wants to fix that,Fast Company,,National,2020,1,13,"E-scooters are leaving people with disabilities behind. Lime wants to fix that. 8% of Lime riders have either a temporary or a permanent disability, so Lime designed an e-scooter for them. But is an accessible e-scooter an oxymoron? If you live in the Bay Area, you may soon spot a new type of scooter cruising down the street: one with a seat. The e-scooter company Lime is testing an updated scooter for people with disabilities in pilot programs in Oakland and San Francisco. This comes on the heels of news that Lime has exited 12 markets and laid off about 100 people, or 14% of its workforce, as it aims to become profitable in 2020. So why invest in accessible scooters? On one hand, an accessible scooter is as oxymoronic as it sounds. Even for able-bodied people, scooters—with their high center of gravity and small wheels that hit bumps hard—can be tricky to ride. The rise of e-scooters has come with an accompanying rash of hospitalizations from scooter-related injuries, and these injuries are head-related at twice the rate they are for bike riders. On the other hand, as Sean Conner, Lime’s Accessibility Policy Lead, explains to me, a lot of people with disabilities are riding Limes, anyway. After surveying 18,000 Lime customers in 80 countries across the globe, his department discovered that 8% of Lime riders currently have either a temporary or a permanent disability (which can range from a broken leg to an autoimmune disease that makes standing tiring). Dangerous or not, people with limited mobility use Lime’s product to solve their “last mile” problem—to get from home to a bus or a train and vice versa. The new scooter is built upon Lime’s third-generation scooter design, which features larger wheels than its predecessors to roll over bumps better. The physical modifications include the seat that you can’t miss, along with a wider handlebar for better balance. The other accessibility improvements are invisible—baked into the performance of the product and even the Lime service itself. The scooter can be turned off by the user to save power (a typical Lime is always on), which ensures that people with limited mobility will never be stranded during their rental control. It’s also necessary because the scooter is designed to be rented for a day at a time rather than merely for a short jaunt. For $32 a day (or $16 for those on public assistance), the scooter will be dropped off at your home for your dedicated use. It’s impossible for anyone outside the program to book it. Conner tells me the Lime team plans to use this early testing to improve upon the hardware. But he admits that it doesn’t adequately address the needs of users with disabilities, and it isn’t anywhere near the complete vision that Lime has for the future of mobility. While 8% of Lime users report having a disability, that figure is already highly self-selecting—compare it to the 15% of all people around the world who are living with disabilities. Scooters, even seated ones, ignore people who need wheelchairs and people who are blind, for instance. And if Lime is to realize its mission to provide last-mile solutions to the entire world, the company will need new products that haven’t been invented yet, and that are more stable and even self-driving.",https://www.fastcompany.com/90450211/e-scooters-are-leaving-people-with-disabilities-behind-lime-wants-to-fix-that
"Scooter Startups Take Steps to Curb Inefficiencies, Address Safety Concerns",Wall Street Journal,,National,2020,1,24,"Scooter Startups Take Steps to Curb Inefficiencies, Address Safety Concerns. Lime, Bird revamp global supply chains and operations as they take stock of soaring costs. Shared-electric-scooter startups have blazed into cities across the world over the past two years. Fueled by roughly $1.5 billion in venture capital, industry leaders Bird Rides Inc. and Lime raced to set up sprawling networks of scooter fleets that users can rent with an app. Over the past year, that breakneck pace of global growth—which has enabled users in more than 200 cities across the world to rent a scooter for a few hours and pay with their phones—has caught up with these companies. Lime and Bird’s ambitious expansions outpaced operations set up essentially on the fly, according to more than a dozen current and former employees. The spotty logistics of their networks have weighed on the companies’ efforts to become profitable and led to safety concerns that this could endanger riders, these people allege. Meanwhile, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is conducting two previously unreported probes into Lime’s scooters, according to Robert Dalton, an attorney adviser at the agency. A commission representative declined to provide further details. A Lime spokesman declined to comment on the probes. Lime and Bird have spent much of the past year revamping global operations in a bid to cut costs. Lime, whose legal name is Neutron Holdings Inc., said earlier this month it would lay off 14% of its workforce and pull out of a dozen markets in the U.S. and overseas. In October, Bird said it would turn its focus from growth to shoring up losses. “Two years ago, the industry didn’t exist and there were definitely mistakes made along the way. But our level of precision, our level of control, is so dramatically better than three months ago, six months ago and a year ago,” said Wayne Ting, Lime’s global head of operations and strategy, in an interview. Bird’s Chief Vehicle Officer Scott Rushforth said in a statement that Bird quickly learned from operations and supply chain forecasting challenges. The startup has created a logistics management system and developed vehicles that use fewer parts and require less repair, Mr. Rushforth added. The renewed focus comes as the pair face pressure to transition from cash-hemorrhaging startups to profitable businesses after public investors hammered a string of highly valued but money-losing technology companies last year. Investors, including prominent Silicon Valley firms, have plowed roughly $3 billion into Bird, Lime and a handful of smaller scooter startups since 2017, according to data provider PitchBook Data Inc. Investors have valued Lime and Bird at roughly $2.5 billion each. Collectively, Bird and Lime’s expansion has been dramatic. Founded in 2017, the startups dropped scooters into metropolitan areas in the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. But operational problems soon arose. Parts and scooter shortages in the companies’ dozens of repair warehouses around the world have caused Bird and Lime to rush components and vehicles by air from manufacturers in China at roughly 10 times the cost of regular shipping, according to current and former employees. Alfredo Huerta, who worked as a Milwaukee-based Lime mechanic until October, said the scooter-rental service purchased more than 100 new vehicles at roughly $1,000 each last summer after a tool shortage prevented mechanics from repairing about 200 scooters that needed a simple fix involving the tightening of screws. Mr. Ting said Lime, in general, has turned a corner on such inefficiencies. “That is antithetical to what we stand for as a company. It’s not just bad operations, that is bad ethics and bad corporate citizenship,” Mr. Ting said. The companies have found it difficult to forecast demand, in part because of inventory systems that offered limited visibility across networks of regional warehouses, said Christine Chang, who worked on Lime’s logistics and supply chain team until last summer, and other current and former employees. Mr. Ting said Lime has improved its ability to forecast demand by implementing software that tracks inventory at its warehouses. This has reduced parts shortages and enabled the company to stop shipping parts and scooters by air, he said. These improvements, which include a personnel shake-up of his operations team and more sophisticated use of data analytics, are critical to the company’s efforts to turn a profit this year, Mr. Ting added. Expansions into new markets also have been costly. The startup was forced to delay its Brazil launch last summer by over a month because it didn’t have enough scooters on the ground there. To fix the problem, Lime shuffled in scooters from other countries, paying extra in custom duties, according to Ms. Chang and a person familiar with the matter. Lime is set to retreat from Brazil as well as a handful of Latin American cities this year. Bilal Zuberi, a partner at Lux Capital, a venture firm that focuses on investing in startups developing and operating physical technology, said he passed on investing in the sector, in part out of concern the logistics challenges of operating scooter fleets across continents would be significant. “If the assumption early on is that something isn’t going to be a big cost, and then that changes on the ground—that’s a problem,” Mr. Zuberi said. Bird also has turned its attention to tackling similar problems. The continuous rollout of new scooter models designed to be more durable made it hard to establish a reliable supply chain for spare parts, while higher-than-expected shipping costs and duties weighed on Bird’s bottom line, according to a person familiar with Bird’s finances. “The reality is these challenges look more like what an automotive or industrial company face,” said Kenneth Schlenker, the company’s managing director in France until last fall. Bird has since implemented new forecasting software, clamped down on the use of air shipping and trained more of its focus on smoothing out logistics inefficiencies, Mr. Schlenker said. Also riding on Bird and Lime’s ability to remake their operations is the issue of safety. Mechanics for both startups say parts shortages affected markets suddenly and would often force them to scavenge parts—including brakes, wheels and throttles—from other broken scooters to make fixes. Brian Kotts, who worked as a Boise, Idaho-based Bird mechanic until September, said mechanics there, facing shortages, routinely fixed scooters using old parts with unknown structural integrity. “We were told: ‘If we didn’t have it, make it work,’ ” Mr. Kotts said. Last summer, during peak scooter season in Los Angeles, a trend caught on where riders skidded scooters along the pavement by slamming on the brakes. Lime’s repair warehouse in the region became inundated by scooters with flat spots worn into the back wheel, said Jordan Van Loy, one of the lead mechanics there at the time. Mr. Van Loy said the repair team tried to order spare wheels. “Like 200 arrived. But we needed 2,000,” he said. Mechanics used old wheels from broken scooters that had piled up in the warehouse. Lime’s inventory systems made determining their age or if the parts previously had been involved in an accident difficult, Mr. Van Loy said. Another shortage last year left mechanics to use their feet to bend several hundred bent scooter forks back into place, Mr. Van Loy added. Mr. Ting said that Lime doesn’t compromise on safety and has checks and balances in place, such as an anonymous hotline that employees, including mechanics, can use to report safety concerns. “I don’t know of an instance where we said we don’t have a spare part and we put the scooter on the road,” Mr. Ting said. “That has never ever happened on my watch, and I will never permit that to happen.” “We never compromise the safety of our vehicles, riders or the communities we operate in,” Bird’s Mr. Rushforth said in a statement, adding that Bird’s logistics team works to ensure its service centers are properly stocked and each vehicle gets reviewed before being redeployed.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/scooter-startups-take-steps-to-curb-inefficiencies-safety-concerns-11579863600
Bird expands its scooters in Europe and Middle East with Circ acquisition,Cnet,,National,2020,1,27,"Bird expands its scooters in Europe and Middle East with Circ acquisition. In the competitive world of electric scooters, Bird aims to get an edge with a new acquisition and $75 million funding round. Bird's stronghold has been the US, but the scooter company appears to be branching out further into the international market. On Monday, it announced that it acquired the European scooter company Circ, along with getting a new investment of $75 million. That means Bird's scooters will now be available in more than a dozen countries.In 2018, Bird was the first company to scatter its scooters across city streets in the US. Since then, the electric scooter market has exploded, with more than a dozen companies operating around the world. Bird has raised $350 million in investor funding and its biggest competitor, Lime, has raised $765 million and has scooters in roughly 30 countries. Still, the scooter business has yet to see a profit as the companies deal with the high costs of operating scooters and surviving regulatory battles. Bird, Circ and Lime have all laid off staff over the last year.""Investors today are looking for financially disciplined companies with a clear path to profitability,"" Bird CEO and founder Travis VanderZanden said in a statement. Regarding Circ, he said he likes ""their laser focus on treating cities as their number 1 customer and their mindset of prioritizing profitability over growth."" Circ has operations in 12 countries, including Germany, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. With the acquisition of Circ, Bird will add more than 300 employees to its European operations. Bird declined to disclose how much it paid for the company.In June, Bird acquired the San Francisco-based electric scooter and moped company Scoot for $25 million. Through that deal, Bird was able to nab one of only three permits to operate in San Francisco. Under the terms of the acquisition, Scoot continues to operate as Scoot but it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bird.",https://www.cnet.com/news/bird-expands-its-scooters-in-europe-and-middle-east-with-circ-acquisition/
"In Tel Aviv, Green, Electrical Shared Scooters are a Blessing—And a Curse | Opinion",Newsweek,,National,2020,1,27,"In Tel Aviv, Green, Electrical Shared Scooters are a Blessing—And a Curse. In 1965, when I visited Tel Aviv for the first time, it sported the newly completed Shalom Tower. The majestic skyscraper stood 34 floors high and was said to be the tallest building in Israel and the Middle East—a distinction the tower maintained until 1996 when the Azrieli complex was completed. Notably, during the last 10 years, Tel Aviv has been transformed. Today, there are dozens of skyscrapers, with more being built all the time—even if the claim to the tallest building has long ago been conquered by the Gulf. Tel Aviv went from a relatively small city, the financial capital of Israel, to one of the world's major technology development hubs—with over 2,000 startups and other high-tech companies residing within its municipality. In the past five years, the amount of commercial real estate in Tel Aviv has doubled, as tower after tower has shot up. But there remains a problem: moving around a rapidly growing city becomes ever more difficult. In 1973, the Israeli government approved the building of a subway in Tel Aviv. Work began immediately but was soon halted. Since then, four alternative proposals have been submitted to construct a subway, none of which ever went anywhere. Work on a light rail project began five years ago, but all denizens of Tel Aviv have seen to date is large-scale disruption of traffic. With nearly no mass transit solution, other than a decent bus system (but one challenged by the increasingly crowded streets), Tel Avivians began to improvise. There have always been a fair number of bicycles in the city, which is mostly flat. About five years ago, many Tel Avivians began to purchase electric bikes, as well as more exotic forms of transport, including various electric skateboards. Three years ago, personal electric scooters began to appear as well. None of these new forms of transport received much publicity. Newsweek subscription offers > All that changed in August 2018, when the scooter-sharing service, ""Bird,"" arrived in Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv was one of the first two outside the United States chosen by Bird. According to Bird Israel CEO, Yaniv Rivlin, Tel Aviv had several important characteristics, including the negative distinction of being ranked the 4th most congested city in the world. According to Rivlin, Tel Aviv is the perfect last mile city: you can get anywhere in town by scooter. Moreover, Tel Aviv is a city of Millennials (over 40 percent of the residents are under 40.) In typical Silicon Valley fashion (i.e., first, do and ask questions later), Bird began to operate in Tel Aviv without asking anyone's permission. Rivlin noted: ""On the first day, we put out 50 Birds [scooters]. There was immediate demand, so we put out more Birds"". Bird quickly recruited a small army of employees, to collect the scooters every evening and recharge them. Bird was quickly followed by three additional companies — Lime, Wind, and Leo. Users were thrilled, pedestrians and the city authorities, less so. When the scooters initially arrived, I was a little too nervous to rent one. I even rode together with my son the first time. But after that first outing, I was hooked. It transformed my mobility. I live in central Tel Aviv and often have to go to the Jaffa Port, a trip that either took 75 minutes on foot, or cost $14 for a cab ride, which would take between 20—40 minutes, depending on traffic. Suddenly, I was able to get to Jaffa in 20 minutes, consistently, at a cost of a little under $5. There was, however, a predicament. Users were leaving shared scooters everywhere— blocking sidewalks, entrances to buildings, wherever they fancied. In addition, residents complained that they were regularly being hit by speeding scooters, in many cases resulting in serious injuries to pedestrians and riders alike. The city had a dilemma. On one hand, the shared scooters caused a certain amount of chaos. On the other hand, as Deputy Mayor for Transportation Meital Lahavi said: ""The arrival of the shared scooters corresponded with two of the city's goals— first, to eliminate ownership of means of private transportation. Accordingly, the city had been supporting in several [vehicle sharing] initiatives. Second, where ever possible, to move the city away from four-wheel vehicles toward two-wheel ones."" Nevertheless, despite all the definitive benefits scooters provide, the city still had to identify strategies to contend with the chaos they generate. So, the city instructed companies operating shared scooters that they would have to meet several conditions going forward. According to Lahavi, the scooter companies were required to: ""serve all parts of the city, give the city data so it could plan better, and institute safety programs."" Lahavi went on to say that in a month, it would be no longer acceptable to park scooters randomly on the side of sidewalks, scooter parking would only be permitted in designated parking areas. Three scooter companies agreed to the city's terms: Bird, Lime, and Wind. And the city's plan worked! Thanks to the technology incorporated into the scooters, companies were able to force users to park almost exclusively in authorized zones. Users continue to love using shared scooters, as Dan, a high-tech worker from Herzliya (originally from New Jersey) affirmed: ""I find the scooters incredibly convenient. I own my own scooter, but when I am going places where it's not convenient to leave my scooter, I rent a shared scooter. It's the best way to get around the city."" The relative success of the shared scooters in Tel Aviv has not been cost-free. As more and more people began to ride, more and more reports of injuries caused by electric vehicles (they did not break out scooters, electric bikes, and other electric vehicles) emerged from the city's Ichilov Hospital. So much so, that The Marker (a respected economic newspaper) ran a daily count of casualties caused by these vehicles. As Dr. Yigal Yachini, a senior internist at Ichilov Hospital asserted: ""It took me a while to convince my grown children never to ride the scooters. They are dangerous."" Yachini went on to say that the number of injuries seems to keep growing. The city has responded to the outcry over injuries by working with the police to enforce the law requiring people on electric vehicles to wear helmets. Furthermore, TLV has now become the first city in the world to demand scooter-share companies provide helmets for all riders. That regulation is scheduled to go into effect June 15, 2020. However, the scooter companies have yet to find a way to implement the requirement. Today, there are close to 8,000 shared scooters in Tel Aviv, which according to the city, average 24,000 rides per day. The problem of injuries is real, but most of the more serious ones occur when scooters and other electric vehicles ride in the street with cars and trucks. The city's attempt to enforce the laws against riding on sidewalks — except where there are delineated bikes lanes — has forced many riders into the streets and traffic. The city has many bike paths but was no doubt caught by surprise by the rapid growth of the scooter enterprise. Now they are playing catch up, allocating NIS 30 million this year to build new bike lanes. Sadly, until enough new lanes can be earmarked to separate two-wheel vehicles from the four-wheels, the accident toll will continue to grow. It seems scooters are here in Tel Aviv to stay, but they will only continue to succeed with the proper private-public partnerships.",https://www.newsweek.com/tel-aviv-electric-scooters-blessing-curse-1484253
At least 29 people have died in electric scooter crashes since 2018,Quartz,,National,2020,2,7,"At least 29 people have died in electric scooter crashes since 2018. Eric Amis, Jr. hopped on a Lime electric scooter for the last leg of his commute around midnight on May 16. The 20-year-old was headed home from his hotel job in Atlanta, Georgia. He had just pulled out of the local metro station parking lot when he was struck and killed by a Cadillac SUV. The driver later told investigators she wasn’t able to avoid him. Amis was one of four people to die while riding an e-scooter in metro Atlanta last year. Each victim died after a collision with a motor vehicle—a car, a truck, and in one case, a county bus. It’s unclear if any of the riders was wearing a helmet. By Quartz’s count, more people have died on e-scooters in Atlanta than in any other city worldwide. At least 29 people have died in e-scooter accidents since companies like Bird and Lime popularized rentable shared scooters in 2018, according to a Quartz analysis of global media reports. Most of the victims were male and were riding the scooter, though a handful of pedestrians have also died after being hit by scooters. Rider fatalities overwhelmingly involved a collision with a motor vehicle. Twenty-nine deaths isn’t many, relatively speaking. In 2018, there were more than 36,000 motor vehicle fatalities in the US, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That included more than 6,000 pedestrians and 857 cyclists. In 2019, there were 29 cyclist deaths in New York City alone. Ride-hail company Uber wrote the growth-oriented playbook that scooter companies like Bird and Lime used in their early days: Launch first and ask permission later. Sometimes neither the city nor the company were ready. Lime in 2018 was forced to repeatedly pull scooters from service, first after discovering batteries in some were liable to catch fire, and then again after identifying a manufacturing defect that could cause scooter baseboards to suddenly break apart while in use. A new and unregulated industry Scooter companies maintain safety is their top priority. Over the past year, as investors soured on cash-burning companies, many scooter companies also shifted their focus from growth to building sturdier hardware and sustainable operations. This focus on safety and responsible growth has become all the more important as cities look to regulate the nascent micromobility industry. “The key thing is safe infrastructure,” said Harry Porter, a spokesman for Santa Monica-based Bird. “I think the best thing we can do is make sure that infrastructure in cities is created in a way that means the Bird users or cyclists or pedestrians are segregated from the big metal boxes that drive around.” Deaths of e-scooter riders have been met with both calls for safer streets and demands to take scooters off the road. Some companies recommend riders wear helmets—and require them for minors—but in practice many riders go without. Atlanta banned new scooter permits after its second scooter death, and set a nighttime curfew for riders after the fourth. The city says it hasn’t had a scooter fatality since, but several operators—Gotcha, Lyft, Lime, and most recently Bolt—have also fled under stricter regulations. Bird and Uber-owned Jump are among those still renting scooters in Atlanta. Because the e-scooters industry is relatively new and unregulated, there aren’t good systems in place for tracking incidents related to them. The data Quartz collected on scooter deaths is almost certainly incomplete, but we couldn’t find a better count. The best estimates come from a handful of studies, like a recent report in JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association that observed a “dramatic increase” in injuries and hospitalizations associated with e-scooter use in the US from 2017 to 2018. A joint study from Austin Public Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last May estimated 20 rider injuries per 100,000 trips. Companies can also resist sharing data, something cities have increasingly sought in exchange for operating permits and to help inform planning decisions, such as where to build new bikes lanes and parking corrals. This general tension around data-sharing makes tracking sensitive information on deaths and injuries even more difficult. Traffic school for scooter riders Lime, a San Francisco-based scooter company, for instance, contested Quartz’s tally that its devices were involved in more reported scooter deaths—11 of the 29 we found—than those of any other firm. (Nine of the reported deaths didn’t identify the type of scooter involved.) Lime said Quartz’s count of deaths linked to Lime scooters was “very close” but declined to provide its own figure. “You have no idea how many fatalities the other companies have had,” Nick Shapiro, Lime’s global head of trust and safety, said in an interview. “If it didn’t make press you wouldn’t know about it.” Stockholm-based Voi, a scooter company founded in August 2018, recorded its first and so far only fatality in May 2019 when a 27-year-old man crashed into a car in Helsingborg, Sweden. Voi spokeswoman Kristina Nilsson said the company believes any accident is one too many. Voi operates an online “traffic school” that lets users take quizzes on subjects like parking, traffic rules, and general scooter knowledge in exchange for ride credits. Completing the test isn’t mandatory to rent a scooter. To date, Nilsson said around 200,000 of Voi’s roughly 4 million users have completed the tests. The UK could soon legalize e-scooters following a government review of how to regulate them. Though not currently approved for use on roads or in cycle lanes, scooters are widely sold in the UK and it’s not uncommon to see them ridden. In July 2019, Britain recorded its first e-scooter fatality when YouTube personality Emily Hartridge died in a crash between her e-scooter and a truck in southwest London.",https://qz.com/1793164/at-least-29-people-have-died-in-electric-scooter-crashes/

Bird Pay tries to appease local businesses plagued by scooters,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,2,25,"Bird Pay tries to appease local businesses plagued by scooters. Money fixes everything. Bird, the electric scooter company, is testing a new in-app purchase capability called Bird Pay. It’s a move that’s meant to appease local business owners plagued by hoards of scooters dumped in front of their stores. The idea is to somehow coax more Bird riders into shops where they can buy chips and soda at the beginning or end of their rides. According to Bird, 58 percent of Bird rides either start or finish in front of local businesses. Here’s how Bird Pay cashless payments work: Open the Bird app and hit Ride, as though you were about to rent a nearby scooter However, instead of scanning a scooter’s QR code, you scan the shop’s code Enter the amount Swipe up to pay using payment information already shared with Bird “Store owners in the community often tell me, ‘Birds outside bring business inside,’” said Bird CEO and founder Travis VanderZanden in a written statement. “This phenomenon paired with our commitment to community resulted in Bird Pay which helps drive even more customers to local businesses. ”That’s a noble cause that could help reduce company complaints, but there doesn’t seem to be much incentive for riders to enter the store and use the Bird Pay app. Bird Pay doesn’t sound any easier to use than Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay, especially in shops with contactless readers. Riders would surely be incentivized to enter local businesses and pay with Bird Pay if the app offered discounts, but none are mentioned by Bird in the announcement. Businesses that sign up for Bird Pay are promised “lower fees” and visibility inside the Bird app for nearby riders to discover. Still it’s early days. Bird Pay is currently in limited testing with select local businesses in Bird’s home of Santa Monica and throughout the Los Angeles area.

Shared bikes and scooters have proliferated in cities large and small in the last few years.

The president of Ford's scooter company says this is just the beginning. Bikes and scooters exploded in recent years, and not just literally.

Electric scooter riders are often forced to choose between breaking the law and endangering themselves. Here's how to change that.,Business Insider,,National,2020,3,9,"Electric scooter riders are often forced to choose between breaking the law and endangering themselves. Here's how to change that. Electric scooters have the potential to change how we move. But they're also woefully dangerous. Since 2018, at least 29 people have died in e-scooter accidents, the majority of them riders. Thousands more have been injured. E-scooters are more inherently dangerous than other vehicles because they're lighter and smaller than anything else on the road. This makes them less stable and more vulnerable to potholes and cracks in the road. And as the smallest vehicle on roads, e-scooter riders stand to be the loser in any accident with another vehicle. Cities have attempted to mitigate these hazards by passing laws requiring riders to wear helmets and protective gear. But adding helmets to rideshare systems presents a major infrastructure challenge. And rideshare users, who often choose rideshare for its convenience, are unlikely to want to carry around their own helmets in the off-chance they might use a scooter later. These laws have faced pushback from scooter and bike advocates, who say mandatory helmet laws will make it less likely for people to use bikes or scooters. And the limited protection that helmets provide doesn't make it easier for e-scooter riders to share a road with two-ton metal beasts that can, and want to, go much faster than e-scooters can. Moreover, the laws governing where riders are allowed to go are unclear and counterintuitive. A 2018 Consumer Reports survey found that over a quarter of riders were unsure of what traffic laws to follow. Many cities recently banned e-scooters from sidewalks, requiring riders to ride in the street instead. But riding on roads is much more dangerous for riders. While motor vehicle accidents account for only 10% of e-scooter injuries, they account for 24 out of 26 reported rider deaths since 2018. Sidewalks are much safer than streets for riders, but it's illegal to ride an e-scooter on sidewalks in many cities because of the danger to pedestrians. Therefore, e-scooter riders are faced with a seemingly unsolvable dilemma: endanger themselves or endanger others. What might make scooters safer Standardizing laws, infrastructure, and promoting educated riding may prevent a scooter-pocalypse. E-scooters are currently available to anyone with a smartphone and a credit card, but the low barrier of entry may be endangering first-time and inexperienced riders. But mandatory training for new riders may be key to protecting both riders and pedestrians. Moped rideshare company Revel offers free two-hour training classes for new riders as well as a short training video. The company also provides helmets in two sizes with each rental, which are sanitized several times a week — a potential solution to the helmet problem. Requiring training for first-time e-scooter riders could also significantly reduce the likelihood of accidents. A CDC study in Austin found that first-time riders accounted for a third of all e-scooter injuries tracked by the study. Mandatory education for inexperienced riders would lead to safer riding practices and address pedestrians' concerns about sharing sidewalks with unruly riders. Another simple solution for many cities is to treat e-scooters as bicycles. In 2019, Calgary passed new e-scooter laws allowing riders to ride e-scooters on sidewalks, pathways, and bike lanes. In contrast to many American cities, which force riders to stay on the road, Calgary prohibits riders from being in roads at all. Helmets are strongly encouraged rather than mandatory, and riders can be fined for interfering with pedestrians. In many places where bike infrastructure doesn't yet exist, sidewalks may be the safest place for e-scooter riders. Opening sidewalks to e-scooters would lead to to fewer fatal injuries, since it would distance riders from motor vehicles, the cause of almost all rider fatalities. Eventually, if the proper steps are taken, e-scooters will simply occupy another niche in our transportation ecosystem. But before that can happen, e-scooter laws need to work for riders, not against them. The sooner cities realize that, the more painless that transition will be.",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-e-scooters-safer-sidewalks-training-and-time-2020-2
How the novel coronavirus is speeding the scooter apocalypse,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,3,13,"How the novel coronavirus is speeding the scooter apocalypse. The scooter sharing industry is getting killed by COVID-19, but something better may emerge. Public transportation is on life support, as the pandemic makes people less inclined to want to cram themselves into underground metal tubes with poor air circulation and nonexistent social distancing. The weather is getting nicer and some states are taking tentative steps toward reopening, even shutting down certain streets to car traffic to make more room for walking, biking, and scootering. So why isn’t the micromobility industry — shared electric bikes and scooters — thriving right now? The novel coronavirus has brought the shared scooter and bike business to the brink of financial collapse. Demand has evaporated — an analysis of credit card data by The New York Times found that spending on scooter rentals had fallen the most of all transportation modes, by nearly 100 percent — companies are laying off employees en masse, and their previously sky-high valuations have been almost wiped out. Rather than basking in the sun and delighting in the reduced car traffic, the scooter industry is looking at end times. “The big scooter companies are losing so much money right now,” said Courtney Ehrlichman, former deputy executive director of Carnegie Mellon University’s mobility research institute. “They’re just trying to hold their pants on. I don’t see them being really strategic. And who’s gonna throw money in to do that right now?” There are some early signs that shared mobility could survive the crisis, even come out looking better than before; one of those “it’s always darkest before dawn” kind of things. But before that happens, the scooter industry as a whole will need to shrink, as it already was doing before COVID-19. And a lot of people will probably lose their jobs. Many already have. Bird and Lime, the two biggest companies in terms of fleet size and valuation, both just went through mass layoffs in recent weeks, eliminating around 580 full-time positions. Most recently, Uber offloaded its shared bike and scooter business Jump on Lime as part of an investment that would see Lime’s valuation drop by nearly 80 percent. Most of Jump’s 400-plus employees are reportedly on the chopping block. Globally, the scooter and bike industry has shed over 1,000 full-time jobs in the past few months, according to online tracker Layoffs.fyi. “They’re not going to weather it well,” said Ehrlichman, who now runs her own strategic advisor firm for mobility companies, of the big scooter companies. “They’re focused on return on investment. They’re not focused on enhancing mobility.” But some could survive the crisis, especially if cities are willing to take a radical step. She thinks rather than imposing fees on scooter operators and limiting the size of their fleet, cities should just start subsidizing them. “I think we’re gonna see community-owned [bikes and scooters],” she said. “Not everybody can afford an e-bike. But if you pooled your money, and those e-bikes were maintained for you, you could have a fleet in your community.” Others agree. In a recent op-ed in CityLab, Harvard Kennedy School visiting scholar David Zipper and transportation planner Marla Westervelt argued that public funding for scooter companies could help fill the gaps where bus and train service has been cut. “Should a micromobility mode that’s famous for amusing tourists and angering sidewalk users really be a priority right now?” they write. “A number of signs say yes.” Unsurprisingly, there aren’t any cities that currently fund micromobility. Even New York City’s enormously successful CitiBike program, which is owned by Lyft, operates without a dime of public funding. But there are early signs that some cities may be willing to underwrite scooter sharing in order to stave off their disappearance. Cities like Denver, Tampa, and San Francisco have classified e-scooter businesses as essential. And Portland, which has said it will open up 100 miles of street space, is offering incentives to keep e-scooter sharing in operation. The city announced a unique deal with Spin, in which Portland would temporarily waive daily scooter fees of $0.20 per scooter and $0.25 per trip in exchange for Spin reducing the cost for a ride by 50 percent. In an interview, Spin’s co-founder and president Euwyn Poon said that despite this arrangement, he doesn’t see taxpayer subsidies as a necessary part of Spin’s future. “We’ve enjoyed our relationships with cities,” Poon said. “And it’s not financial subsidy that we’re asking for from cities, but rather, working with us … in designing sustainable operating models.” Even more important than direct subsidies is a fair way to limit how many scooter companies operate in each city, Poon says. San Francisco, for example, allows only three companies — Lime, Spin, and Jump — to operate 500 scooters each. Poon added, “There’s no hard ask from us here for cities.” Lyft has a successful model for bike-share — exclusive, long-term contracts with cities, no direct public funding, corporate sponsorships to help defray costs — but has yet to replicate that for its scooter business. The ride-hailing company shut down its scooter operations in six cities last year and laid off 20 workers from its scooter division. Sean Flood, CEO of shared micromobility company Gotcha, said scooter companies shouldn’t be afraid to cut a deal with city officials. Gotcha, while not as well known as Bird and Lime, has carved out a business by mostly focusing on universities and college campuses. The company, which operates small fleets of bikes and scooters in cities like Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama, has seen ridership and revenue increase in recent weeks thanks to these preexisting partnerships. Subsidies, in addition to corporate sponsorship deals, will have to be in the mix in the future, Flood said. “Shared mobility historically as a system has not subsidized, but why not subsidize it?” he said. “It’s not a bad word.” Cities are slow to keep pace with the changing transportation preferences of their citizens, writes Greg Shill, a law professor at the University of Iowa. He notes that California taxes scooters at roughly 30 times the rate it taxes Uber and Lyft rides. “If California — which styles itself as both a tech innovator and a progressive champion — were deliberately trying to disadvantage green, affordable new mobility products versus their carbon-dependent, costly alternatives, it could hardly do so more effectively,” Shill says. Even so, many cities probably won’t be in the position to waive fees or offer public funding of scooter operations in the near future. The pandemic has taken its toll on many municipal budgets, forcing cities to consider cutting transportation, parks, and education spending. Public transit agencies, which would seem like a natural fit for scooter companies to help address last-mile challenges, have seen their farebox revenue streams dry up. Meanwhile, other cities have proposed shutting down vast swaths of streetscapes to cars to encourage social distancing, a scenario that could be a huge boon to scooter riders — if they return. The early data is dispiriting, but not surprising. Driving is making a comeback; public transportation is not. Mobility data from Apple shows that driving and walking, while still down from the baseline by 30 percent and 44 percent respectively, are slowly rebounding. Public transportation, however, is stuck at 75 percent off from the baseline. As the world emerges from lockdown, coronavirus-wary commuters are likely to continue avoiding public transportation and ride-share vehicles. Scooters and bikes are seen as less risky than other shared modes of transportation. There are fewer contact points, and it’s easier to maintain a distance of six feet when riding a bike or a scooter. Lime, which initially pulled out 99 percent of its markets in response to the virus in March and has since returned its scooters to some cities, is seeing some early positive signs. Trips in South Korea are up 14 percent, the company told Streetsblog. And riders in Columbus, Ohio and Oklahoma City are taking longer trips than they did before the pandemic — which could indicate people are mode switching from public transportation to scooters. The scooter industry was already facing serious financial headwinds before the pandemic. Scooter sharing has always been a money loser, with most companies relying on venture capital to keep operations running. The industry has been struggling to fix its unit economics, in which the purchase price for each scooter exceeded the amount of revenue it brought in before breaking down. Lime claimed to be on the verge of profitability before the pandemic hit, while Bird said its unit economics had “dramatically improved.” Things were shrinking in scooter-land before COVID-19, too. There were too many scooter companies, with indistinguishable vehicles and pricing schemes, and seemingly interchangeable four-letter names. Bigger players were beginning to gobble up the smaller startups. Bird acquired Scoot, Ojo absorbed Gotcha to form Last Mile Holdings, Latin American scooter companies Grin and Yellow merged to form Grow Mobility, and before last week’s deal, Uber was a minority stakeholder in Lime. So far, Lime is the only scooter company to raise cash during the pandemic — and this round represented a 79 percent drop in valuation. Lime’s rivals are similarly desperate and likely willing to negotiate. Companies like Bird, Spin, Tier, Voi, and Dott are all holding on for dear life, praying that demand for scooters returns as the pandemic subsides. With historically low gas prices, many urban experts are worried that cities are about to become flooded with traffic congestion. Since the shutdown, the skies have never been clearer in most cities. If the car comes roaring back post-pandemic with a vengeance, carbon emissions and smog will come with it. Shared bikes and scooters are still a better deal for cities, despite their shaky financial situation, said Horace Dediu, an analyst for Asymco who helped coin the term “micromobility.” “The limiting function on personal driving has always been the cost, in terms of time and parking for personal vehicles,” Dediu said. “If more [people] drive, the costs rise yet further. Micromobility has the benefit of lower cost, better health and wellbeing, while still being personal transportation.”",https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257307/electric-scooter-bikeshare-covid-19-bird-lime-uber-subsidies
Lime is yanking its electric scooters from California and Washington due to coronavirus,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,3,17,"Lime is yanking its electric scooters from California and Washington due to coronavirus. Italy, Spain, and France, too. Lime is temporarily suspending service in California and Washington, as well as Italy, France, and Spain, in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The announcement came after San Francisco and its surrounding counties instituted a “shelter in place” order intended to curb the spread of the disease. Lime may have little choice to suspend service in California after the Bay Area’s “shelter in place” order effectively bans nonessential travel “on foot, bicycle, scooter, automobile or public transit,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. But the decision to ground its scooter fleet in Washington and three European countries, places hard hit by the pandemic, is so far unprecedented in the nascent micromobility space. “Like you, we are worried about the cities we love and call home, the people we serve, and our colleagues on the ground,” Brad Bao, CEO of Lime, said in a blog post. “Loving cities means protecting them too. For now, we’re pausing Lime service to help people stay put and stay safe.” So far, other major scooter companies like Bird, Spin, Skip, Uber, and Lyft have yet to take similar dramatic measures. In response to a request for comment, spokespeople for those companies said they had yet to make a decision or were closely monitoring the situation. All of the scooter companies have said they have stepped up their cleaning procedures and are advising customers to protect themselves by wearing gloves while riding. The pandemic could be a disaster for the scooter rental business, especially coming on the heels of the winter season, which is when most companies see a large dip in ridership and revenue. In January, the company announced that it was laying off 14 percent of its workers and exiting 12 markets. Lime, along with its rivals like Bird, Uber, and Lyft, have struggled to make scooter-sharing profitable. Most experts agree that the market is oversaturated and needs to consolidate. Lime joins Bird, Skip, Scoot, and Lyft in laying off its scooter-related employees in recent months.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183202/lime-scooter-coronavirus-suspension-california-washington-countries
Uber Sues Los Angeles Over Data-Sharing Rules,Wall Street Journal,,National,2020,3,25,"Uber Sues Los Angeles Over Data-Sharing Rules. The battle could set the stage for how cities police mobility providers while safeguarding privacy. Uber Technologies Inc. UBER -2.42% sued the Los Angeles Department of Transportation on Tuesday, escalating a monthslong disagreement over the city’s data-collection efforts. Uber has been sparring with the city’s transportation authority over a rule that requires that it share real-time location data for its dockless scooters. City officials have said they need this data to better manage traffic on public streets and reduce safety hazards caused by abandoned scooters and bikes. The information they collect is treated as classified, they say, and stripped of personally identifying information. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying “it is not business as usual for the city” as it wrestles with the coronavirus pandemic. She said Uber recently began complying with the rules that it was challenging. Earlier this month, Uber began sharing real-time location data with Los Angeles to avoid pulling its Jump scooters from the city. Previously, it shared data with a 24-hour lag. But the company argues that the collection of real-time data could give governments a precise window into the daily lives of its residents, even if the information is scrubbed of names and other directly identifiable information. Uber says the information could be used by government agencies—or breached by malicious hackers—to target specific groups or communities, stalk individuals or commit fraud. A legal battle could set the stage for how cities strike a balance in policing the companies that use their streets while safeguarding people’s privacy. Uber alleges that the city’s real-time data sharing requirement violates state and federal law, including the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles. The Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unlawful search and seizure of private property. Uber asks in the suit that the Transportation Department pay attorney fees and other costs associated with the trial. It also asked “for any other relief that the court deems just and proper.” Other U.S. cities are closely watching what happens in Los Angeles. Many use the same software—developed by the city’s Transportation Department in 2018—to track mobility providers on their streets. “When you’re talking about real-time data location sharing, you’re essentially talking about surveillance,” Uber’s chief privacy officer, Ruby Zefo, said in an interview earlier this year. Los Angeles hasn’t told the company what it plans to do with the data, who it plans to share it with or how it plans to safeguard it, she said. “We’d be willing to participate to standardize these things,” Ms. Zefo said, but right now “there is no standardized way of doing it.” Rival Lyft Inc. shares real-time scooter data with Los Angeles, but a spokesman said the company has expressed “continued concerns about the privacy risks of collecting” it. In a letter addressed to the city’s transportation agency last year, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Lyft said underserved individuals are more likely to hail bikes and scooters than private taxis. They are also more likely to have run-ins with law, the company said, raising questions about whether real-time location sharing “could become a surveillance tool for law enforcement.” Worries that government agencies could use big data to spy on people aren’t without precedent. The Journal reported last month that the Department of Homeland Security bought access to a commercial database that maps the movements of millions of cellphones in America and uses it to track people suspected of entering the U.S. unlawfully. The location data was drawn from ordinary cellphone apps, including those for games, weather and e-commerce, for which the user had granted permission to log the phone’s location. Dockless scooters are relatively low-tech devices that are vulnerable to attack, according to researchers. Last month, researchers from security company Imperva Inc. said they were able to reverse-engineer connections between scooters and company servers to track the location of individual vehicles in Tel Aviv. Murtuza Jadliwala, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, published a paper earlier this year outlining how a hacker could break into location systems, steal payment details and even launch physical attacks by compromising the Bluetooth connection between a rider’s smartphone and the vehicle. Such information is sensitive, but Mr. Jadliwala said that mobility providers already collect it. “I think from that aspect, the thing that we need to worry more about is how are the service providers using that? Because they are the ones that have hordes of passenger or rider data,” he said. Uber’s Ms. Zefo says the company collects “location data to manage our assets. We’re not out to do anything more than that.” The private sector has “all kinds of legal requirements” that don’t apply to governments, she said. City officials believe that Uber’s primary concern isn’t user privacy. They say the company is using the argument to circumvent regulation and resist sharing information about its operations. “That fear of data collection as the slippery slope towards full government regulation is very much in the DNA of these companies,’’ Seleta Reynolds, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said in a recent interview. “It’s because of the history of how they launched and grew up.” Uber has come under scrutiny over user privacy. In 2017, it settled accusations from the Federal Trade Commission that it failed to properly monitor use of a program called “God view” that allowed staff to view user trips in real time. Another software, “Greyball,” was designed to identify law-enforcement officials and competitors attempting to disrupt operations. “That’s not the company we are now,” Ms. Zefo said. Uber hired Ms. Zefo in 2018 as its first chief privacy officer.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-sues-los-angeles-over-data-sharing-rules-11585104223
Lyft is offering free e-scooter trips to health care workers fighting COVID-19,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,4,3,"Lyft is offering free e-scooter trips to health care workers fighting COVID-19. Lyft will provide free electric scooter rides to essential workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While most scooter-sharing programs in the US have temporarily ceased operations in response to the pandemic, Lyft is still operating scooters in a handful of cities, and the company wants to support the transportation needs of health care workers and others on the frontlines of the crisis. Lyft is offering free scooter rides through April 30th, up to 30 minutes in length, for first-responders, health care employees, and transit workers in the following cities: Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Monica, and Washington, DC. Employers like hospitals, clinics, and transit agencies can email Lyft at heroscooters@lyft.com to obtain enrollment information that they can distribute to staff. Lyft says it will prioritize scooter deployment near local hospitals for health care workers. The company is continuing to disinfect contact surfaces on scooters each time they are recharged, including handlebars, brake levers, bells, and throttles. The team is also disinfecting high contact surfaces on vans used to transport scooters at the start of each shift. “Lyft scooters can play a unique role in providing essential transportation to critical workers on the frontlines against COVID-19,” said Caroline Samponaro, head of micromobility and transit policy at Lyft. “In a time of crisis, we know Lyft can be an essential lifeline, and we are proud to serve first-responders, transit, and healthcare providers as they serve the public.” Previously, the ride-hailing company said it would provide free and discounted bike-share passes to essential workers in half a dozen cities. Free or cheap bike and scooter trips are especially useful as public transportation ridership continues to plummet in most cities and ride-sharing is not seen as a safe alternative. In fact, there has been a surge in cycling in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Of course, Lyft’s ride-sharing business has plummeted as health officials instruct people to avoid unnecessary travel. The company’s rides business has been cut in half in recent weeks, according to The Information. Lyft’s revenue after paying drivers is likely to be less than $150 million a month currently, down from about $260 million a month during the first quarter of last year, the publication reports. Lyft’s rival, Uber, has also seen a huge drop in demand and sales. Both companies have come under fire for classifying drivers and delivery workers as independent contractors. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote a letter to gig companies calling on them to “reclassify your delivery workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, and ensure they are provided a full suite of employee protections and benefits.”",https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206656/lyft-scooter-free-essential-workers-coronavirus-health-care
"Lime reactivates small fleets of scooters, offers free rides for healthcare, law enforcement workers",The Verge,Vox,National,2020,4,19,"Lime reactivates small fleets of scooters, offers free rides for healthcare, law enforcement workers. Lime Aid is rolling out in about a dozen cities with more planned soon. E-scooter-sharing company Lime is reactivating small fleets of scooters in about a dozen cities and will offer free 30-minute rides for health care workers and law enforcement officers, the company announced. Its Lime Aid initiative is meant to address essential workers’ need for transportation while social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Micromobility plays a critical role in moving people seamlessly through cities, and as an individual form of transportation, scooters can help fill an integral transportation gap at this important time,” the company said in a statement. It will partner with the cities to determine the best locations for the scooters. Lime says in the release the scooters are meant to be used for essential trips only, such as to the grocery store or doctor’s office, not for joy riding or other purposes. The company plans to start Lime Aid in the first batch of cities, which includes Austin, Baltimore, Columbus, Dallas, Nashville, Norfolk, Va., Oklahoma City, Salt Lake City, and Washington D.C. in the US; Berlin and Cologne in Germany; Paris, France; Rimini, Italy; and Tel Aviv, Israel. Lime says it will expand to other cities in the coming weeks. Lime, the largest e-scooter-sharing company in the world with some 120,000 scooters in 30 countries, said in March it would be suspending service in nearly two dozen countries.

How electric scooters will factor into a post-lockdown world,Axios,,National,2020,4,22,"How electric scooters will factor into a post-lockdown world. A big question is whether people will still want to ride scooters — or any shared vehicles, for that matter — after we emerge from coronavirus lockdowns. What they're saying: On the one hand, plenty of transportation experts think scooter riders will think twice before picking one up after it's been handled by previous riders. On the other hand, micromobility enthusiasts say scooters will provide a critical way for people to get around while maintaining distance from others and can fill gaps while struggling public transit systems recover. Lime's experience in South Korea could offer a glimpse of what will happen when we return to more typical travel patterns. The company has continued to operate a few thousand scooters in Seoul and Busan during the pandemic, and it says scooter use has nearly returned to pre-crisis levels. In a survey of 65 Lime scooter riders in Denver, people anticipated similar levels of car and micromobility use after the crisis, with reduced use of transit and ride-hailing and increased walking and biking. Meanwhile, rival Bird says it will begin rolling out a new feature that will let customers ride its scooters at a slower speed to get more comfortable if they are new or out of practice. The company says it aims to help riders who may be turning to scooters as an alternative to other transportation modes that make it harder to stay far apart from other people. The bottom line: Transportation will look different in every city after we exit lockdowns, and how quickly people embrace shared and public transit modes will probably depend on how severe the outbreak has been in their areas. Car use is expected to go up in most places, at least temporarily, until cities assess public needs and roll out new pilot programs with new rules of the road.",https://www.axios.com/electric-scooters-coronavirus-transportation-bf16d65c-63ea-42f6-88fa-916d22b9b2fc.html
Bird brained,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,4,23,"Bird brained. Inside the electric scooter startup with big workplace problems. Emma was up late working on a complex analysis from her laptop in bed for Bird. In mid-March, as COVID-19 was extinguishing public life in cities across the world, the scooter company announced that it would pull its signature electric two-wheelers from some areas. Every day since had been a scramble to put together cost-cutting proposals and revenue alternatives to the brand’s core rent-and-ride business, from an IT project that would save the company hundreds of thousands in hardware costs to leasing out small fleets of scooters to restaurants to use for deliveries. Emma didn’t mind putting in the extra hours — in fact, she was used to it. “It’s hard to explain just how cool the energy [at Bird] was,” she says. Her co-workers were young, brilliant, and sincere in their belief that their electric scooters were going to change the world. “We were fucking obsessed with our jobs.” The next morning, March 27th, Emma received a calendar invite ambiguously titled “COVID-19 Update” — and a flurry of concerned texts and Slack messages as other meetings around the company were quietly canceled. At 10:30AM, she logged into the one-way Zoom webinar. After an uncomfortable wait, a woman’s voice began reading a script in a choked monotone, informing the attendees that they had all been laid off. The speech was two minutes, and the meeting abruptly ended. Emma watched as her computer automatically logged her out of her email and Slack accounts and then reverted to a locked gray screen. Emma was one of 406 Bird employees who lost their jobs that day, out of the company’s 1,400 or so worldwide. (dot.LA first broke the story of Bird layoffs, and obtained audio of the meeting.) In some ways, Emma was one of the lucky ones. She was luckier than the many employees who’d received the news secondhand, either because their shift was at another time of day or because the company had purchased a webinar license that was too small and accidentally locked many invitees out. She was luckier than the IT staffer who apparently wrote the script to instantly deactivate their accounts — with no idea that it would be used to disable his account, too, which then disrupted the whole process until the remaining IT staff could find a plan B. And at least for a couple of minutes, Emma was luckier than Rebecca Hahn, the chief communications officer who was appointed to read a curt firing script, seemingly through tears, instead of the company’s founder and CEO Travis VanderZanden. As much as she’d loved her job at Bird, that was the day that Emma began to reflect on some of the troubling things she’d seen at the company that she’d previously been willing to overlook. And she wasn’t the only one. Conversations with 16 former Bird employees across a wide variety of departments paint a picture of erratic decision-making, careless leadership, and puzzling, ever-changing metrics of success that left even the biggest internal believers privately wondering if their business model could ever add up to the dream they’d sold investors. But more than anything, Bird was a workplace with high turnover. Employees were laid off in ways that felt careless and dehumanizing. A mass firing over Zoom wasn’t really so out of line with what people had already experienced. Bird set out to establish a scooter-based future for transportation. That meant it paid close attention to how long each scooter lasted on the road. The company, however, seemingly spent very little energy on how long its employees lasted in the office. At the end of the day, some believe that the $2.5 billion valuation that helped make Bird the industry’s fastest-growing unicorn was also its greatest curse. “When you put that crown on a company,” says one former employee, “they owe it to investors and to themselves to grow at all costs. … And when you only focus on growth, you stop focusing on people. … Once that snowball started rolling down the hill, there was no stopping it.” BirdBird always leaned into its own lingo. The company had a program called “Get the Flock Out” (or “GTFO”), which encouraged employees in the government partnerships department to expand how many scooters were permitted in each city, according to employees familiar with the program. The startup never shied away from cutesy puns. There were Birdwatchers, the contract workers responsible for monitoring the fleet; “nests,” where Birds were assembled to charge; and Birdhunters, who were responsible for retrieving lost scooters. The proprietary language might have helped contribute to the sense of solidarity embodied in the catchphrase “BirdFam,” which even laid-off employees continue to use when speaking about their colleagues. Almost across the board, former employees have nothing but praise for their peers (including managers and direct reports), calling them “phenomenal,” “talented,” and “super motivated, super, super smart.” Every day at the unprecedented company was a thrill, inventing new paradigms and writing the rules as they went. “You got to watch an idea blossom into an industry,” says a former staffer, “[Having] a front row seat to that... was an amazing experience.” Former employees say they loved spending time with their co-workers on nights and weekends and found themselves wanting to talk about work even off the clock. But their impression of the executive ranks tells a different story. Bird’s leadership was described in various interviews as “bros with personality problems,” “doofuses,” “creepy,” “very into nepotism,” “not sound decision makers,” and “a bunch of frat boys who all looked and sounded alike and made a lot of money.” “There was a lot of buffoonery,” elaborates one departed employee. One such incident apparently occurred at an operations team all-hands last summer, when tensions between the company’s hourly wage earners and management were at an all-time high. Employees had been invited to provide feedback in an anonymous online form where their colleagues could “upvote” questions or statements they agreed with. According to multiple sources familiar with the meeting, the discussion focused heavily on complaints of low pay and false promises, prompting COO Steve Schnell to shout at the room something along the lines of, “You can either shut up or get the fuck out!” He even offered a $1,000 bonus to anyone who chose to leave the company. Some in the room felt that he had made up the policy on the spot. In a statement responding to the story, Bird said: “During an operations all-hands meeting, Steve delivered a pay increase message to members of the team, offering them $1,000 to leave if they were not happy with that increase, similar to the Zappos pay-to-quit approach. Steve regrets using offensive language, and HR and the legal department counseled him about how he delivered the message following this meeting.” In another widely known episode, Schnell traveled to a summit in Amsterdam, where he got so drunk that he decided it would be amusing to fire employees at random over Slack. “It was a joke,” says a former employee familiar with the incident. “He was like, ‘Haha.’ Only he didn’t say ‘Haha’ because he forgot.” This winter, Schnell was quietly moved away from his COO duties, though he officially retained the title. Asked about this incident, Bird said, “While at a summit in Amsterdam, someone took Steve’s phone and played a practical joke on two top-performing employees he’s close to, and those employees recognized it was a joke.” Some parties were described as tame, but recent holiday parties were notoriously debaucherous. Sources describe some employees doing cocaine, pills, and marijuana. Relationships between co-workers were openly on display. Kerry Fischer, Bird’s Vice President of People and Places, said the company had not received reports or complaints of drug-related behavior. “Bird has strong policies against the use of illegal drugs and/or the misuse of legal drugs,” she said. “If we receive a report, allegation or complaint about an employee openly using drugs at our holiday party we would investigate and discipline that individual as appropriate. In addition, company-sponsored parties end by 10 pm.” Travis VanderZanden’s first C-suite stint at a vehicular startup was as COO at Lyft, following its acquisition of his on-demand car-wash app Cherry in 2013. VanderZanden must have felt that he quickly outgrew the role because, in 2014, he gave the company an ultimatum: make me CEO, or I’m out. The board called his bluff — and then sued him for allegedly stealing company secrets. (He then countersued, and the two parties settled out of court for an unknown amount.) Despite the messy exit, he landed a new job at Uber where he worked for two years as VP of Driver Growth. VanderZanden carried over both companies’ obsessive “growth hacker” mentality, touting their focus on scale in Bird’s early rounds of funding. Bird came to depend on Uber’s “land and expand” strategy of planting its scooters in new cities without permits, and then counting on their popularity with riders to persuade local governments to give them a pass. (VanderZanden also packed his C-suite with fellow ride-sharing alums: COO Steve Schnell and CPO Ryan Fujiu both put in time at Uber and Lyft, and CFO Yibo Ling came over from Uber.) “[VanderZanden’s] ideology was: ‘We shouldn’t have to pay a city, the city should be paying us,’” says a former member of Bird’s government partnerships department. That employee voiced frustrations about alienating local governments with Bird’s cavalier attitude — damaging the kinds of relationships that took years to build. When certain smaller cities did reach out to them offering exclusive agreements, he claims he was directed to ignore their emails because they weren’t deemed profitable enough to be worth their time. Bird sold cities a vision of reduced carbon emissions, traffic-free streets, and increased accessibility for low-income riders in transportation deserts that were known internally as “equity zones.” While Bird faced major pushback — and even some lawsuits — in cities like New York, San Francisco, San Diego, and Milwaukee, many other municipal governments did see real opportunity in partnering with them. Those governments often requested access to Bird’s data to ensure compliance with their regulations, which became an ongoing battle, according to one employee familiar with negotiations. Bird had a financial interest in keeping its scooters in high-income areas on several fronts: it got more rides per day, experienced lower scooter churn rates, and had to allocate fewer resources to making sure scooters were kept inside the lower-income “equity zones.” In one meeting, an employee raised the topic of placing scooters in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles. According to a source familiar with the meeting, chief legal officer David Estrada responded that neighborhoods like that weren’t considered because “we want to make sure we get our Birds back.” “People were shrieking in their seats” at the apparent implication that Birds were more likely to be stolen in black neighborhoods, says the source. Employees later received an apology. When asked about this incident, Bird denied that it occurred, and added: “We have strong social equity efforts to serve lower-income neighborhoods and David Estrada never advocated or suggested that we stop that service.” (Estrada is no longer at the company.) Another former employee alleges that the idea was brought up semi-jokingly “in multiple meetings” to remove the tracking devices known as Bird “brains” from scooters intended for equity zones and place them in mailboxes in the area so that the Birds could roam freely elsewhere without government detection. When asked, Bird said: “This is an alleged suggestion that was never explored nor developed. Such an idea would be contrary to our brand and business model. It runs counter to our public commitment and track record of data transparency with cities in which we operate.” But in plenty of cases, Bird did backtrack on its most benevolent gestures. After publicizing its free helmet program, Bird lobbied with the California government against helmet requirements. For all the talk of sustainability, the vehicles Bird boasts can last over 18 months in one study went to waste in under a month. And the widely touted “Save Our Sidewalks” initiative, in which Bird pledged one dollar for every scooter toward infrastructure projects in certain host cities was quietly shelved last year. Almost right up until the COVID-19 crisis, Bird continued to move toward expanding into new territories with what some perceived as little thought or research into market profitability. By the time Bird was pulling scooters from the streets, it had a presence of some kind in over 120 cities around the world. While the expansion into Europe and the Middle East was a relative success before COVID-19’s disruption, the attempted expansion into the Latin American market in 2018 is regarded among employees as one of the company’s greatest missteps. A theft ring in Mexico City made it particularly difficult to get the business off the ground. “We were losing thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars a day [in Chile and Mexico City] because we weren’t getting any rides,” says one former employee. “We didn’t take the time to understand the culture,” says a former member of the data team. “We were trying to impose values and a system that didn’t necessarily work for [them].” Bird cut its losses and paused operations in Latin American cities even before the pandemic obliterated their bottom line, employees say. The fixation on expansion meant hiring sprees. As recently as this winter, an employee familiar with the onboarding process estimates that the company was bringing in between 10 and 15 new employees every week while offboarding around five. And periods of fervent hiring were followed by waves of layoffs. The recent layoffs on March 27th were reminiscent of what one source referred to as “The Pizza Party Firings” of 2019. On March 14th, 2019, former employees say, as the office was celebrating Pi Day with pizza, some employees were corralled into a conference room where they received a brief speech, not unlike the one given on this year’s Zoom call, before being escorted out of the building by security with no opportunity to retrieve their belongings from their desks. Between 4 and 5 percent of the workforce was laid off that day. Bird provided the following statement: “We did not host a companywide pizza party prior to a reduction in force in 2019. It’s true that 4 percent of the Bird workforce was laid off in March 2019.” In June that same year, the company acquired the electric vehicle company Scoot in order to get access to the competitive San Francisco market. By December, it laid off up to two dozen Scoot employees. Something similar happened after Bird bought its German competitor Circ this January. And according to a former Circ employee, it implemented significant cuts following the acquisition. “Why are you gonna hire that many people if you’re just gonna treat them like they’re disposable?” asks one employee who lost her job last spring. The boom and bust cycles were visible not only in the hiring and firing processes, but in everything from employee perks to department budgets. “The company swerved constantly,” says a former employee. “Basically, all the resources would always be pulled towards whatever they’d decided was necessary in the moment and then pulled away from other things, which was the most spastic way to run a company.” Bird would throw expensive holiday parties, and “then months later it would be like, ‘Freeze spending,’” says a former manager from another department. “[They] had to keep a certain amount of money in their account at all times. Once that money fell below a threshold, it was like, ‘Hold off all payments.’” Several employees described bridges burned with third-party vendors, from independent lobbyists to a nationwide shipping company. According to one employee, Facebook also suspended Bird advertising after the company failed to make payments, disrupting Bird’s ability to find and hire new contractors. (Bird denies that Facebook advertising was suspended.) Compensation for Bird’s own employees was also described as highly discretionary, partially based on the timing of one’s start date, which is not unusual in quickly growing startups. But being liked was also described as one of the most valuable assets one could bring with them to the company. And to be liked, according to various sources across different departments, it never hurt to be a white man. “When you looked at the same experience level and tenure within the company, and you looked at people of color versus not, you did see some favoritism,” says a former employee who served as a lead in one of Bird’s employee resource groups. Meanwhile, both men and women interviewed for this article confirmed that they were aware of instances where women were making less than men in equal or even lower positions on their teams. Issues of diversity and inclusion at Bird were a low-lying debate that would flare up every few months. Employees said many women at the company felt frustrated by a lack of female presence in the C-suite or on the board. When an employee raised the question in a biweekly all-staff, VanderZanden allegedly appeared uncomfortable and said, “We just got one,” presumably referring to Rebecca Hahn. “Travis would talk about how hard it was to get a woman on the board because no VCs are women,” said another source. Race was no less of a contentious topic. One former employee describes being a person of color pushing for diversity at the company as, “Not knowing you’re in a fight, but feeling really exhausted at the end of the day.” As with many modern startups where there’s an indelible divide between salary-earners who build out processes and the wage-earners who implement them, there were three levels at Bird. First was the well-compensated, overtime-exempt side — people in data, engineering, product, city operations, finance, etc. Second was a group that often got lumped in as a catchall term: “operations specialists,” hourly, non-exempt wage-earners whose duties might range from answering support calls to coordinating retrievals of scooters that had “gone thermal” (Bird-speak for “caught on fire”) to helping launch new products like Bird Pay. And third was the Flyers, the gig workers who could pick up individual tasks like moving or charging Birds through an app in exchange for one-off payments. Of the second, hourly-wage group, one interviewee says, “They have this large group of people who weren’t making that much money, but had gone to good schools, doing really routine work and not getting promoted.” Former employees in these roles who gave interviews referenced unfulfilled promises that they would be promoted within their first six months of employment. Another salaried employee puts it more bluntly: “Hourly employees were treated like shit. They were expected to work, work, work. A lot of people who should have been put on salary were not.” It also was not lost on employees interviewed that the hourly group had a much higher makeup of people of color. On company demographics, Bird said: “We’ve worked hard to build a diverse team of employees, including on the executive management team, and we know we can and will improve.” One thing that might help explain the apparent inequity at the company was the loss of a forum to effectively bring complaints. When the head of people and culture Taylor Rose left the company over a year ago, former employees complain that she wasn’t effectively replaced until Kerry Fischer came in as VP head of global people and places the following fall. The gap in HR leadership, sources allege, made it difficult to escalate questions of pay disparities and discrimination. Bird disputes this account, saying: “We have consistently had an HR head, and a robust global HR team. Our compensation model was developed and vetted with a third-party consulting firm that works with other global companies. Gender and race have never been considerations for compensation. Instead, we look to seniority, experience, expertise, and performance as key criteria. We’ve worked hard to build a diverse team of employees, including on the executive management team, and we know we can and will improve.” This winter, the company implemented a more standardized, formal performance review process in order to ensure more equitable career movement, which some saw as encouraging. Unfortunately, as one former employee puts it, “not enough of the people of color remained [at the company] to see it play out.” OverOver time, some employees began to grow doubtful of the business model — especially once it became clear how quickly Bird was burning through cash. Regardless, Bird did successfully secure $275 million in Series D funding on a $2.5 billion valuation in October 2019. Investors were apparently encouraged by the strategic pivot to unit economics over growth-above-all. But the unit economics argument is a difficult one to parse. “A good day for a Bird is two rides,” says a former employee familiar with the breakdown. “And the average ride is about five dollars.” Only, “a day,” she clarified, is not actually a day, but the amount of time a Bird spends “in the wild” (i.e., charged, undamaged, and available on the streets). Meaning that $10 of revenue might actually stretch over several days or less than a day. Start to factor in the operating costs and the liabilities — from city fines to scooters thrown in the ocean to the long winter months when many Birds enter “hibernation” — and the profit margin only becomes more anemic. Some employees speculate that these kinds of convoluted calculations were an intentional move to obfuscate a troubled business. “Travis would say during the meeting, ‘We’re profitable per ride, if you exclude some other stuff,’” says a former engineer. “No one would ever just say, ‘We’re profitable, period.’” One thing that may have heartened investors was Bird’s willingness to move away from its micromobility ideals internally. The New Ventures team, described as a “startup within a startup” was intended to explore revenue alternatives. The program, where Schnell’s efforts were reallocated following his soft removal as COO, had mixed results. One of their projects was Bird Pay, a mobile payment app that had the misfortune of debuting around the same time COVID-19 was beginning its sweep of the globe. When Bird Pay was launched, employees say they were granted unlimited spending on the app for the first month, a move that some suspect was implemented to inflate numbers for investors. But employees were unimpressed with the product. “Obviously, it’s super glitchy like everything we’ve ever launched,” says one employee. Most notably, users had to manually enter the amount they owed for each transaction. Due to the difficult-to-discern decimal point that appeared, according to former employees, VanderZanden took the app out for a spin one day in Santa Monica and accidentally wound up paying thousands of dollars for a cup of coffee. “[He was] furious, apparently,” says one of the interviewees who shared this story. Bird denies this incident saying, “Our CEO never paid $1,000 for a cup of coffee because of an early version of an app feature that was quickly fixed.” VanderZanden did not take kindly to public smears of his image. When The Information reported that Bird had lost $100 million in Q1 2019, VanderZanden grew irate. From an airplane, he began posting rampantly on social media — including one chart that displayed Bird’s unit economics from an unrepresentative, peak summer month and a graph that showed year-over-year revenue growth but, as one Twitter user pointed out, failed to include a Y-axis. On internal Slack channels, VanderZanden’s staff followed his lead. “Anytime there was something negative about Bird in the press, someone would post it [on Slack] and the comments were very positive. ‘The journalist doesn’t understand the full picture!’” A former member of one of the mission teams alleges that the company hired a brand protection agency to defend the company on trending LinkedIn critiques. Another former employee describes the public displays of loyalty as “like a cult.” Of the employees who survived the March 27th layoffs, she says, many of them were “yes men.” Employees were given the opportunity to put their money where their mouth was. Upon getting hired, they were given various options to divide their compensation package between salary and stock options, a common practice among startups, which effectively amounts to placing a bet on the success of the company. Employees laid off this March would have a year to exercise the option to buy stock in the company for a drastically lower price (called a strike price) than the general public would after an IPO. Laid-off employees were surprised to check their latest options grant to see that their strike price had plummeted from a peak of over $3 to just 14 cents. Several of the former employees interviewed speculated that this was a result of a comparably revised post-COVID valuation going into the next round of funding. “I have a year to buy my stock, but if I had to make the decision right now, I would say the company’s not gonna make it and I’m not gonna touch those shares,” says one employee. In response to the strike price, Bird said, “We repriced options after a third-party 409a appraisal was completed. The updated strike price has zero impact on the company’s preferred valuation.” When the cloud of COVID clears, Bird will likely have to reckon with the inherent impossibility of pleasing all of its stakeholders. The vision it sold cities is not a profitable one, and the vision it has since sold investors goes against its entire mission. On top of that, its fixation on growth to meet its impossibly inflated valuation has proven unsustainable. It remains to be seen if their pivot to profitability has come too late. “This isn’t just a Bird problem, but an industry problem and an investor problem,” warns one former employee, who hopes that others can learn from Bird’s mistakes. “If you’re going to give a valuation that high, you have to help that company grow at a sustainable rate. No one was holding anyone accountable.” Since March 27th, those who were laid off have banded together. Despite the disappointing end to their time at the company, most of the former employees interviewed maintain fond memories of their former colleagues and are proud of what they built. The publicity around the firings inspired a number of tech companies to reach out for interviews and job offers, helped along by former managers who spread the word about the quality of their work. One former engineer who left the company voluntarily recalls watching as the layoffs unfolded in the public eye: “[It] was such a terrible PR move. They got a lot of loyal people... to turn against them.” As many leaders in the tech industry have learned the hard way, one bad decision can have long-lasting implications. It all calls to mind one of the lines read out the morning of March 27th: “When we come out at the other side of this unimaginable storm and begin to scale up unpaused markets, increase fleets, support riders, build products, and more, we hope we can work together again.” Former employees disagree. “Bird lost,” says one man who was laid off last month. “They lost irreplaceable employees. They lost employee satisfaction. They lost brand loyalty… I’ve never seen such a large group of people come together to get through such a difficult time together.” He added: “We are BirdFam. We are truly family.”",https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231802/bird-electric-scooter-company-workplace-culture-layoffs
Lyft extends free scooter rides for critical workers amid coronavirus pandemic,Cnet,,National,2020,4,24,"Lyft extends free scooter rides for critical workers amid coronavirus pandemic. Free scooter rides for health and transit workers are now available through May. At the start of April, Lyft began offering free scooter rides to assist first responders, health care professionals and transit workers through the coronavirus pandemic as they do their jobs. On Friday, Lyft said it is extending the assistance another month. Lyft made available unlimited 30-minutes rides to critical workers in Austin, Texas; Denver; the DC metro area; Los Angeles; San Diego; and Santa Monica, California. To qualify, employers need to enroll their workers in the program. Lyft said the free service will run through May. As part of the service, Lyft said it's deploying additional scooters around hospitals. Lyft said it's offering similar free services for those doing critical jobs in Boston with Bluebikes, in Chicago with Divvy, in New York with Citi Bike and in the San Francisco Bay Area with Bay Wheels. The free rides for critical workers are part of an expanded effort by Lyft to assist during the crisis and keep its drivers working, including offering assistance for low-income seniors, young families and people with disabilities and delivering medical supplies. Lyft and Uber drivers have expressed concerns about driving during the crisis, and those in California asked both companies to take steps to protect them.",https://www.cnet.com/news/lyft-extends-through-may-free-scooter-rides-for-critical-workers-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/
Scooter-sharing expected to bounce back from COVID-19 crisis,Cities Today,,National,2020,4,28,"Scooter-sharing expected to bounce back from COVID-19 crisis. The scooter-sharing market faces temporary disruption due to coronavirus (COVID-19) but the industry can weather the storm in the longer term, new analysis suggests. By 2024, 4.6 million shared scooters will be in operation worldwide, up from 774,000 in 2019, according to a new forecast from IoT analyst firm Berg Insight. Berg Insight expects to see around 482,000 sit-down electric scooters by 2024, with standing scooters dominating the market. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the dockless scooter industry hard, with several companies drastically reducing fleets and pausing services. Others that are still operating have seen ridership tumble as citizens stay at home to meet lockdown rules. Some operators are providing free rides for healthcare workers. Berg Insight’s analysis finds that the COVID-19 crisis will result in lower-than-expected shared scooter ridership in 2020 but says it won’t have an impact on the long-term growth of the market. The sector faced challenges before coronavirus, including business model uncertainty, safety concerns and fragmented regulation but Berg Insight’s outlook is still optimistic. E-scooters were legalised in New York State earlier this month but are still prohibited in some markets including the UK, Ireland, China and Singapore. The UK is testing and consulting on e-scooter deployment. Many cities limit the number of stand-up scooters allowed on the streets through mandatory operator licences. Martin Svegander, Senior Analyst at Berg Insight, said: “The regulatory environment shows notable between regions, national markets and even on city level due to varying regulatory frameworks. There are still plenty of untapped potential markets for scooter-sharing operators and we also expect that more countries will allow scooter-sharing services in the upcoming years.” Shared micromobility could also play an increasing role as a growing number of cities seek to reduce car usage. Outlining plans for transport once Rome begins to re-open after the coronavirus lockdown, the city’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, said that bikes and scooters should be prioritised. “Otherwise, even if we put public transport back into operation, we will be invaded by traffic, and it is a scenario that we must avoid,” she said. In a recent blog post, Michael Schwartz, Head of Customers and Policy at Ride Report, a software platform for running bike and scooter share programmes, urged cities to begin to plan “in light of new economic realities”. “2020 was shaping up to be a tough year for private micromobility operators even before COVID-19, but this past month has hit micromobility companies hard, challenging the industry’s survival,” he said. “What does micromobility look like as a tool for economic development in the middle of a likely recession? Think about whether a city’s current rules and ordinances still apply or if some adjustments could be made.” A separate report from Berg Insight forecasts that the number of vehicles deployed in bike-sharing schemes will grow from 23.2 million in 2019 to 35.8 million in 2024.",https://cities-today.com/scooter-sharing-expected-to-bounce-back-from-covid-19-crisis/
Lime relaunches scooters in Baltimore for essential medical personnel,Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2020,5,2,"Lime relaunches scooters in Baltimore for essential medical personnel. Lime relaunched four dozen of its peppy black and green scooters Saturday to help essential medical personnel get to work while maintaining social distancing. The company announced that about 50 scooters will be deployed in downtown Baltimore near the University of Maryland Medical Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Mercy Medical Center as well as around the Inner Harbor. Lime pulled its scooters from cities all across the country, including Baltimore, earlier this year. It’s part of the company’s Lime Aid program aimed at helping doctors, nurses and laboratory technicians get to work while maintaining social distancing protocols. During the pandemic, essential medical personnel can receive a 30-minute scooter ride free. The rides are intended to be used for essential travel only, such as to a grocery store, pharmacy or hospital. Medical personnel can sign up for them on the company’s website, Li.me. “We understand there might be apprehension about taking public transit right now,” Robert Gardner, Lime’s director of government relations, wrote in an email. “We wanted to provide an alternative that helps essential workers get where they need to go safely. This is a moment for everyone to come together and we hope Lime Aid can have a positive impact in assisting the heroes saving lives in Baltimore hospitals.” Lime has launched similar programs in such cities as Washington and Nashville. Russell Murphy, Lime’s communications manager for North America East, said they are being well-received. “Micromobility is filling a really important transportation gap at this time,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/lime-relaunches-scooters-in-baltimore-for-essential-medical-personnel/2020/05/02/a70dfb50-8c13-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html
Will coronavirus kill the electric scooter?,E&E News,,National,2020,5,4,"Will coronavirus kill the electric scooter? The electric scooter is, depending on your point of view, a dangerous blight of the sidewalk or a marvelous new species of transit that is perfect for the zero-emissions future city. So it's a cause for celebration — or mourning — that the novel coronavirus is dealing the world's networks of shared scooters a heavy blow. They have vanished from the streets, and in some cities they might not return. With these transit children in peril, city governments face a question: Should they intervene to save them? Despite their youthful indiscretions, shared-scooter networks have a lot to offer cities. One study found that only walking, cycling and crowded buses have lower emissions than shared scooters.Short trips standing at the handlebars of these two-wheelers can remove car trips (and their congestion and tailpipes) from the streetscape. But a rescue is unlikely; scooter providers have been hard for cities to love. Like Uber before them, the first movers in scooters seeded their vehicles in downtowns in rogue operations, and proliferated like weeds as young users seized on them. The strategy was to get customers today and mend relationships with disgruntled city officials tomorrow. But tomorrow arrived sooner than anyone expected, and with only a four-year track record of existence, scooter providers have arrived at the COVID-19 crisis with a troubled business model and few friends in high places. ""No one was making money, and no one knew how to make money,"" said Marla Westervelt. ""COVID is accelerating the challenging economic space that scooters were in and making their runway a lot shorter."" Westervelt should know. A month ago, the transportation planner and more than 400 others were unceremoniously laid off from Bird, the Santa Monica, Calif., scooter operator that launched the sector in 2017, in a Zoom call. Though some may relish the scooter's demise, the companies that provide the service point out that a two-wheeler provides a lot more social distancing than a bus or train — and might be missed when it's gone. Nimble, smaller than a bicycle, and all-electric, scooters are well-suited to short trips and as a bridge to longer-haul forms of transit, like buses — though making that vision into reality is a long way off (Energywire, March 18). They are dockless with no home base, left in random places by one user and located by the next by smartphone app. Often they are less parked than strewn, knocked onto their sides to trip people on sidewalks. Scooters hurled into trash cans and bodies of water are staple images on social media. Along with increased ridership has come a spike in hospitalizations, including frequent head injuries among riders who rarely wear helmets. The many detractors of e-scooters view them as a hazard and an eyesore. The largest providers, like Bird and Lime, have raked in hundreds of millions of venture-capital funding — yet were operating at a loss even before the COVID-19 era. Westervelt and colleague David Zipper wrote an essay in the publication CityLab called, ""Anyone Feel Like Saving Electric Scooters?"" ""I think some city officials have a misconception about how limitless the wallets or bank accounts of these companies are,"" Zipper said in the essay. ""They might soon find themselves wondering how they can get scooters back."" 'Kind of icky' As social distancing lockdowns swept across the country, the streets emptied not just of people, but scooters. That's because the ""micromobility"" industry — the purveyors of both electric scooters and shared, often electrified, bicycles — removed vehicles en masse from the streets in many cities in a desperate bid to conserve money. The impact of COVID-19 on shared scooters has been almost as devastating as it has been for high-touch environments like bars and hair salons. According to data from Earnest Research on credit card and debit card spending by Americans, and visualized by The New York Times, spending on scooter services recently dropped to almost zero, a bigger hit than even mass transit, which has seen its ridership evaporate. The reason is simple: No one is traveling, and those who are don't want to touch handlebars and brakes of a shared vehicle that might harbor viruses. ""Wow, seems kind of icky,"" is how Don MacKenzie, the head of the Sustainable Transportation Lab at the University of Washington, put the new perception among many users. One likely result is a culling of the herd. There are 50 or 60 scooter companies around the globe, said Christopher Robinson, a mobility analyst at Lux Research. He added, ""You will see a lot of the smaller companies not survive this."" The survivors are likely to be the ones that are supported by enormous venture capital investments, including Bird and Lime. Other micromobility services have been acquired or built as arms of larger firms, including Jump, a service absorbed by Uber, and Spin, a provider bought two years ago by Ford Motor Co. But even a wealthy backer doesn't solve a fundamental problem: Scooter sharing often loses money. Scooters are heavily used and abused, and the need to replace them erases profits, according to an analysis by Quartz. They also need many hands. The micro-steeds must be picked up from remote corners where they were abandoned and driven back to high-traffic areas, a process known as rebalancing. They are collected each night and recharged. They need repairs. And that doesn't account for large technology operations to build out and run the smartphone app. Such burdens led both Bird and Lyft to trim staff last year. And Lime, another big company in the scooter space, laid off about 100 people in January — before the epidemic hit — and last week announced it was cutting an additional 13% of its workforce. Endangered species While the result of the downturn might be electric scooters disappearing for good from many areas, there's little evidence that cities will stage a rescue. City and state transportation budgets are facing severe shortfalls (Energywire, May 1). Ridership of buses and trains has cratered, drying up fare revenue, while other sources of funds like sales, income and gas taxes are also in decline because of the coronavirus lockdowns. Tough sacrifices are coming for transit agencies' core services. One thread of support comes from Portland, Ore., where the transportation bureau waived the fees it charges Spin, one of its only providers still operating. In exchange, Spin slashed the cost of its rides in half. Scooter providers don't have reserves of goodwill in most cities, the result of a short and rocky relationship. ""The way that the early micromobility companies played with cities didn't do them a lot of favors,"" said Robinson, the analyst with Lux. ""It created this micromobility-versus-cities kind of attitude."" The trajectory of scooters is an abbreviated version of that of Uber and Lyft, the ride-hailing platforms, which took hold in cities around the world faster than governments could write rules. Scooter companies didn't spread quite so easily because many cities, the Uber experience fresh in their minds, banned scooters from the streets and only allowed them back as part of a master plan. Cities often permit scooters only in certain numbers, and the providers are assessed fees based on the number of vehicles or rides. They sometimes also are required to serve lower-rent parts of town where services are needed but aren't as profitable. Partnerships are starting to appear between e-scooter providers and municipal transit agencies, though whether they will survive the coronavirus emergency is unknown. A unique arrangement was announced last year between Spin and the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority in Ohio. Spin pays the agency to charge, rebalance and repair its fleet of about 200 vehicles. And in Kansas City, Mo., a fleet of two-wheelers made by a company called Drop Mobility is operated by a nonprofit that is funded in part by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority. One name that comes up frequently as a civic partner is Spin, the service owned by Ford. Spin is the only major scooter company that has continued operations through the crisis, though only in eight metro areas. That Spin is owned by a giant automaker, which also provides fleet autos to cities, isn't a coincidence. ""The last thing Ford wants to do is piss off cities and miss out on a much bigger service,"" said Westervelt. But even with that level of backing, it's hard to compete for a city's subsidy dollar among vehicles with a much bigger and well-entrenched constituency: bicycles, buses and cars. ""We are a 4-year-old industry right now, and these other transportation providers have been around for about 100 years,"" Derrick Ko, the CEO and co-founder of Spin, said on a recent webinar about the industry. ""Their role in our culture and society are really different."" Can an upstart form of electric transit that makes the city cleaner and less congested kick its bad-boy image and gain the trust of cities before it runs out of money? Time will tell. ""It's a huge asset and addition to a transportation network,"" said Westervelt, ""but just because something is good and useful doesn't mean it's to survive if we don't figure out how to invest in it.""",https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063042785
Uber rival Bolt aims to launch scooters in 45 cities,Reuters,,National,2020,5,5,"Uber rival Bolt aims to launch scooters in 45 cities. Estonian ride-sharing service Bolt on Wednesday launched its own electric scooter model and said it aims to launch the scooter service in more than 45 cities this summer. Bolt, which has grabbed business from Uber mostly in major African cities and Eastern Europe, has more than 30 million users in over 35 countries. “A lean mindset and efficient operations have helped Bolt to bring quick, affordable and reliable urban transport services to millions of people in Europe and in Africa,” Dmitri Pivovarov, head of scooter business at Bolt, said in a statement. Bolt said its model’s design and engineering are focused around modularity, which makes it easily repairable and lowers the cost of maintenance for the ride-sharing service.

E-bikes and e-scooters are set to play a key role in easing the UK out of lockdown,CNBC,NBC,National,2020,5,13,"E-bikes and e-scooters are set to play a key role in easing the UK out of lockdown. The British public has been told to avoid using public transport wherever possible. Hundreds of millions of pounds are being invested in making the U.K. more cycle friendly and e-scooter trials have been brought forward from next year to next month. Retailers say e-bikes and e-scooters are selling out as people look to find new modes of transport. The scenes of people cramming onto a London Underground train on Monday were enough to send a shiver down the spine of anyone who has been keeping half an eye on the coronavirus crisis. U.K. Health Minister Matt Hancock urged the public to try to get to work by bicycle Tuesday after being challenged about the issue by ITV show “This Morning.” “People should avoid public transport unless they absolutely have to use it, because it is safer when there is fewer people on it,” Hancock said. “You say not everybody can cycle, that’s true, but lots more people can than do and now is actually a good time to start cycling to work because there is hardly any traffic on the roads so it’s much more pleasant to cycle than in normal times.” Last week, the U.K. government announced a £2 billion package “to create a new era for cycling and walking.” That includes £250 million to establish new bike lanes and safer junctions in England. Similar initiatives are being announced in other countries: German cities are re-marking roads to create “pop-up” cycles lanes, for example. At the same time, the government said it plans to fast-track trials of e-scooters, which are technically still illegal in the U.K. Trials are to be brought forward from next year to next month and they’re going to be nationwide instead of in just four parts of the U.K. The move will be music to the ears of U.S. e-scooter rental start-ups Lime and Bird, as well as European rivals Tier, Bolt, Voi and Wind. Travis VanderZanden, CEO of Bird, said in a statement: “With public transport capacity constrained due to the pandemic e-scooters will provide people with a sustainable and socially responsible transportation option. Congestion and air quality has improved dramatically in towns and cities throughout the U.K. in recent weeks, and we’re pleased to see the Government is committed to keeping it this way as part of their green transport revolution.” All this is also good news for companies who sell e-bikes and e-scooters. Indeed, business is booming for e-bike entrepreneur Taco Carlier, who just so happens to be based in the world cycling capital, Amsterdam. VanMoof, the Dutch start-up that he founded in 2009 with his brother Ties (who now lives in Taiwan), has seen a surge in demand for its e-bikes with the arrival of Covid-19. “Two months ago, everything changed due to the virus and everything started growing even faster,” said Carlier on a call with CNBC, adding that global sales are up around 48% compared to the same period last year, and U.K. sales are up 184%. The company, which employs 250 people, has sold around 120,000 of its trendy e-bikes, which are made in either The Netherlands or Taiwan. The two latest models (the S3 and the X3) cost 1,998 euros ($2,170) but the unprecedented demand means they’re not shipping until the end of July as it stands. VanMoof is far from the only bike retailer struggling to keep up with demand. In 2019, VanMoof’s revenues came in at nearly $40 million. That figure is expected to double to $80 million in 2020, Carlier said. The fast-growing revenues have attracted the deep pockets of venture capital investors at Balderton Capital in London, which led a 12.5 million euro funding round into the company Wednesday as they look to capitalize on VanMoof’s success. Carlier described Balderton as the perfect partner to help VanMoof to globalize and scale. “The mission is to get as many bikes in San Francisco, New York, Paris, London and Tokyo, as we have in Amsterdam,” said Carlier. VanMoof’s bikes — sold in VanMoof stores in Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin, London, New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Taipei and Tokyo — are equipped with anti-theft technology. A bike’s location can be tracked on the company’s smartphone app and if a bike does go missing, the company’s “bike hunters” will go and retrieve it for them. Other e-bike options include the fold-up GoCycle, which was founded by McLaren automotive engineer Richard Thorpe, and Specialized Turbo Levo Comp, which is the bike manufacturer’s first pedal-assisted mountain bike. “Many have taken a short term view and pulled out their old bike from the shed only to find that it is as tiresome and in-convenient as they had remembered,” said Thorpe. “Smart commuters are going for e-bikes and we have seen sales of our fast-folding GX range rocket upwards within the last few weeks – literally at a rate 4x in urban areas compared with this time last year. Covid is pulling the adoption curve forward.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/13/e-bikes-e-scooters-key-role-lockdown.html
Britain is launching e-scooter trials ahead of schedule. These are the start-ups racing to take part,CNBC,NBC,National,2020,5,15,"Britain is launching e-scooter trials ahead of schedule. These are the start-ups racing to take part. Bird, Lime, Voi and Tier are all in talks with local authorities about launching trials in British cities as early as next month. Trials were scheduled to take place in 2021 but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps decided to bring them forward as the U.K. looks to come out of lockdown. E-scooters have proved popular in other cities but they aren’t without their problems. Electric scooter companies are racing to take part in planned U.K. trials after the test window was brought forward to next month, from 2021, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. firms Bird and Lime confirmed to CNBC that they are in talks with several local authorities across the U.K. about applying for permission to test their e-scooter rental services, as did European start-ups Voi and Tier. As the U.K. starts to ease its lockdown, the government says it’s taking steps to avoid a second wave of cases. The virus can spread easily on public transport, so people are being told to avoid using trains and buses wherever possible. If everyone were to start driving in their cars again, roads would quickly become clogged up and pollution levels would soar. The City of London is banning cars entirely on the busiest roads to help manage the anticipated return of tens of thousands of workers. Fredrik Hjelm, the CEO and co-founder of Sweden-headquartered Voi, said his firm is recruiting a team in the U.K. to work with authorities on rolling out e-scooters. “Right now we have an opportunity to reinvent urban transport and to increase our use of electric vehicles, bikes and e-scooters,” Hjelm told CNBC in a statement this week. Voi said it has been talking to Transport for London and London boroughs, as well as Manchester, Salford, Bath, Teeside, Darlington, Hartlepool, Milton Keynes, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Who’s in the lead? Lime indicated it could be at an advantage in the race to put the two-wheelers on Britain’s streets, as it already runs several popular e-bike rental schemes across the country. “We hope to be able to follow this model and partner with boroughs and local authorities to offer our e-scooters as soon as possible,” said Alan Clarke, Lime’s director of policy and government relations in the U.K. and Ireland. Many countries in Europe have embraced e-scooters but they are still illegal on U.K. roads as a result of a law dating back to 1835. They’re also banned on sidewalks. In a bid to clamp down on people riding their own e-scooters, police have issued fines and confiscated e-scooters. However, one small Bird trial has been taking place on private land in London’s Olympic Park. Bird argued that this pilot could place it in a good position to gain access to Britain’s wider rollout. Patrick Studener, head of EMEA at Bird, said: “We’ve been very fortunate to have the U.K.’s only electric scooter pilot in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Over the last year-and-a-half we’ve had MPs and city officials down to the park to see for themselves the advantages scooters — and specifically Bird — can bring to towns and cities throughout the U.K.” “Following the government’s announcement on scooter trials, we’ve had dozens of inquiries from city officials who want to get their cities moving again; congestion and emission free, while maintaining social distancing. We’re looking forward to further guidance from the Department for Transport on how and when we can implement our service here.” An e-scooter consultation period was due to take place next year in four corners of England — Portsmouth and Southampton, the West of England Combined Authority, Derby and Nottingham, and the West Midlands. But over the weekend, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he was fast-tracking the consultation period to next month and making it nationwide. If the trials are successful, then laws will likely be updated. Shapps said he would be “fast-tracking trials of e-scooters, bringing this programme already underway for next year forward to next month, and extending those trials from four local authorities to every region in the country that wants them in a bid to get e-scooter rented schemes up and running in cities.” The trials do not extend to privately owned e-scooters at this stage. Still early days Scooter-sharing companies and local authorities that CNBC spoke with said they’re still awaiting clarity from the government on the next steps. Iyma Atiq, communications manager for Birmingham City Council, said the Department for Transport had written to all local authorities about fast-tracking the scheme. “The Council will be participating in briefings with DfT and will look to work with provider partners to shape a trial scheme that best fits with our local environment and wider policy objectives,” said Atiq. “Until we have more detail we are understandably not in a position to talk about specific potential operators.” Although e-scooters and e-bikes are touted as a more pleasant way to get from A to B, they aren’t without their problems. Some cities, such as Paris, have struggled to deal with the sheer number of e-scooters that have been dumped on their streets by companies like Lime and Bird. Questions have also been raised about the relatively short lifespan of some vehicles, as well as how safe they are. Bird investor Martin Mignot, a partner at venture capital firm Index Ventures, told CNBC that now is the time to rethink cities. “We’re at a crossroads,” he said. “This is the time to make roads safer and hopefully some of the companies we’ve invested in will be part of that.”",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/bird-lime-voi-tier-uk-escooter-trials.html
"Bike-share and e-scooter companies, hit hard by the pandemic, may come back stronger",Washington Post,Washington Post,National,2020,5,16,"Bike-share and e-scooter companies, hit hard by the pandemic, may come back stronger. While it’s unclear when Americans will return to life as normal following the coronavirus pandemic, experts are fairly certain work habits will change dramatically, with more people returning to solo car commuting and more teleworking to protect against infection. Bike-share and e-scooter companies are hoping to capitalize on the public’s need for social distancing and come back stronger than before the pandemic, when the vehicles were ubiquitous on streets and sidewalks throughout the country. Cities are hoping for a resurgence in the modes to avoid a return to pre-pandemic traffic levels and to help fill gaps left as most public transit systems continue to provide reduced service. “Given the choices we have, [bikes and scooters] seem to be the much safer modes of transportation,” said Ashish Kabra, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies shared transportation. “You are able to social distance yourself and still have a means to get to where you need to get to without a car.” There are early indications that use of bikes and scooters is increasing. Bike and scooter sales are up, according to reports. And operators of rental services are reporting ridership has picked up and new riding patterns: People are using the bikes and scooters to make longer trips, rather than shorter rides to connect to transit. Once people return to work, industry leaders and experts are projecting that commuters may feel a greater sense of protection against the virus when using personal and shared bikes and scooters than taking public transit or services such as Uber or Lyft. Industry officials say they, like those in other transportation sectors, have taken extra cleaning measures and will maintain more rigorous disinfecting routines. They also plan frequent reminders to users about good hygiene practices while riding, such as washing their hands after their trips. Bike-share programs such as the popular Citi Bike in New York and Capital Bikeshare in the Washington region continued to supply transportation during the pandemic, and some systems including Citi Bike have seen such increased demand during the pandemic that they are planning expansions. The District Department of Transportation is planning to add 30 new Capital Bikeshare stations this year, although officials declined to say whether the service faces any budget uncertainties as a result of the health crisis. DDOT Director Jeff Marootian said Capital Bikeshare remains a central piece of the city's transportation system and plans to expand its access to as many people as possible. Marootian also said the District is ready to be flexible to allow private rental services to expand if demand grows. The city also plans to continue to promote the use of car alternatives to avert increases in vehicle traffic and setbacks to environmental and traffic safety goals. Several cities around the country, including Seattle and Oakland, are encouraging bike, scooter and pedestrian traffic by shutting down some streets to vehicles. Some cities are also easing regulations on scooter and bike operators. Portland, Ore., is offering incentives for residents to use scooters through a partnership with Spin. The city allowed Spin to add more scooters to its fleet and temporarily waived fees in exchange for Spin cutting the cost of its rides by half. Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom earlier this month announced a multibillion-pound plan to boost cycling and walking during and after the lockdown and fast-tracked a program to allow e-scooters on U.K. roads as early as next month — nationwide — instead of in just a few cities. Montreal, Paris and Milan have built temporary bicycle and pedestrian facilities as part of their coronavirus response. “This is the moment really to encourage as many people who are interested and are willing to try bikes or scooters to do it and to set up the infrastructure and support them,” said Greg Billing, executive director of the Washington Area Bicyclist Association. He said there is already a renewed interest in biking amid the pandemic. David Spielfogel, chief of policy at Lime scooters, said the company is working closely with cities to beef up their operations and ensure access and availability is widespread when commuters return. “Cities are demanding change more quickly,” Spielfogel said. “Local governments are desperate for open-air mobility options that allow for social distancing, and they're quickly turning to bikes and scooters.” Most private rental operations shut down amid the health crisis, and while some have returned, they are in only a fraction of their pre-pandemic markets. The pandemic has driven some of the scooter and bike start-ups to the brink of financial ruin. For some of the bigger companies that hoped to turn a profit, those plans have been derailed, too. Lime, which had announced layoffs early in the year, laid off 13 percent of its global workforce in late April. Its competitor, Bird, laid off nearly one-third of its 1,400 employees in late March, giving workers the bad news in a two-minute message via Zoom, according to the Verge. Uber and Lyft have also laid off hundreds of employees combined, affecting their scooter and bike-share operations. In early May, Uber offloaded Jump, its bike and scooter business, to Lime as part of a $170 million investment. The deal ensures Lime has “the resources to not just weather covid, but to have the runway to reach full company profitability, which we expect to do in 2021,” Spielfogel said. And by absorbing Jump into its operations, Lime’s fleet will grow significantly. However, it remains to be seen whether that’s a benefit to the company when Jump was losing $60 million a quarter. Even before the crisis, scooter and bike rental companies had started to pull out of some markets. Officials with Lime and Bird said they are evaluating what markets they will return to as demand grows. “My guess is some of the smaller companies, if they don't go out of business, they'll be acquired,” said Sarah Catz, a research associate at the University of California at Irvine’s Institute of Transportation Studies. As a whole however, the industry “will be a survivor from the pandemic and come out stronger,” she said. In places where private scooter and bike operators remained or have resumed services, officials said they are seeing promising ridership trends. In South Korea, Lime ridership is up 14 percent compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to the company. Lime is operating in 20 of the about 120 global markets — including cities and college campuses — where it was operating before the pandemic. In Columbus, Oklahoma City and Washington, companies report users are taking scooters for longer rides, signaling that riders are making their full commutes on the vehicles rather than for first-mile, last-mile trips. Bird, which returned to the streets of the nation’s capital this month after weeks weathering the pandemic, said demand is in line with pre-pandemic numbers. The District is one of a few markets where Bird has resumed operations; the company was in more than 100 locations before the health crisis. Rebecca Hahn, chief corporate social responsibility officer for Bird, said the company is planning to resume service in more cities as demand rises. “We’re able to limit or decrease the number of individuals using public transit while, at the same time, providing an option that is a responsible social distancing mechanism. You’re one individual on one vehicle at one time,” Hahn said. “And that allows us to adhere to these social distancing guidelines that I imagine will be in place for quite some time.” Those in the industry say they want to support local governments in their goals and work with cities during society’s reopening and after public transit comes out of the crisis. Cities and the industry agree that micromobility options can alleviate some of the crowding on trains and buses. Some transit systems, including Metro, have said they don’t plan to resume normal operations for months while they look to enforce social distancing aboard trains and buses. “We’re well poised to provide transportation service during reopening,” said Samantha Herr, executive director of the North American Bikeshare Association. If the early days of the crisis offer any lessons, she said, it is that people in major cities turned to bikes and scooters to get around as transit systems began to reduce service and more people grew concerned about riding in crowded trains and buses. “Shared mobility continued to be a viable option for those people that had to move around” at the onset and during the pandemic, she said, noting that bike-share and scooter systems that remained in operation during the pandemic restrictions were critical to support hospital and other essential workers. “It is a great transportation option for folks as states and localities start to reopen,” Herr said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/why-bike-and-e-scooter-companies-hit-hard-by-the-pandemic-may-come-back-stronger/2020/05/16/076e2900-95d5-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html
Uber sends thousands of electric bikes and scooters to the scrapheap after Lime deal,CNBC,NBC,National,2020,5,28,"Uber sends thousands of electric bikes and scooters to the scrapheap after Lime deal. Footage of the red Jump bikes being scrapped at a North Carolina recycling plant emerged on social media. Bike enthusiasts said it was “hard to watch” and suggested that Uber could have donated them to charities. Uber sold its Jump division to mobility start-up Lime earlier this month but Lime did not want the older vehicles. Uber is scrapping thousands of electric bikes and scooters worth millions of dollars after selling its Jump unit to mobility start-up Lime earlier this month. The firm said it decided to “recycle” the older models that Lime didn’t want after concluding that it would be too complicated to give them away due to the maintenance and technical support that they need. Footage of the distinctive red Jump e-bikes being destroyed at a North Carolina recycling center was shared on social media on Wednesday by user Cris Moffitt, angering bike enthusiasts around the world. Emily Eros, who recently salvaged an old bike of her own, said on Twitter that the footage was “hard to watch.” Companies which offer e-bike and e-scooter sharing — including Uber — have talked up their green credentials, saying their fleets are more environmentally friendly. This escapade, however, is likely to undermine those claims, especially as it comes at a time when the world is more reliant than ever on alternative forms of transport. Uber acquired Jump for around $200 million in April 2018 and in December it promised to double down on its investment in electric bikes and scooters in 2020. Earlier this month, Uber led a $170 million investment into Lime. Under the deal, Uber is transferring the Jump division to Lime. Uber was keen to point out that while many bikes and scooters are being scrapped, “tens of thousands” of newer models are in the process of being transferred to Lime. “As part of our recent deal, Lime took possession of tens of thousands of new model Jump bikes and scooters,” an Uber spokesperson said. “We explored donating the remaining, older-model bikes, but given many significant issues — including maintenance, liability, safety concerns, and a lack of consumer-grade charging equipment — we decided the best approach was to responsibly recycle them.” A Lime spokesperson said: “As part of the Jump acquisition, we took possession of tens of thousands of e-bikes — including the spare parts and tools to fix them — and have already begun to deploy them. “We have not recycled any of the Jump e-bikes in our fleet and are committed to scaling and operating them during this critical time. Once the transaction officially closes, we plan to work with Uber to find sustainable ways to donate and re-use any remaining e-bikes in their inventory.” Jump e-bikes and e-scooters in Europe are not affected as the deal between Uber and Lime is yet to close on the continent.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/uber-bikes-scrapped.html
"Micromobility companies have used sustainability as their key selling point for years, yet Uber just decided to scrap tens of thousands of electric scooters and bikes",The Rising,,National,2020,5,30,"Micromobility companies have used sustainability as their key selling point for years, yet Uber just decided to scrap tens of thousands of electric scooters and bikes. In the last few years, micromobility has taken transportation by storm. A flurry of scooter companies, including Lime, Bird, and Jump rose quickly to prominence. They sold an ambitious dream to make last-mile transportation environmentally sustainable, affordable, and efficient. That dream we bought. From college towns to major cities, rentable electric bikes and scooters have become ubiquitous. And with the rise of the trend, larger companies like Uber followed suit. So in 2018, Uber bought Jump. While the two years that followed showed no growth limit in sight, Covid-19 had everything crashing down. Uber recently sold its Jump business to Lime, and invested in the latter at a significantly reduced valuation. This left Uber with a lot of spare inventory — and that led the company to the alarming decision of scrapping between 20,000 and 30,000 bikes and scooters. While one of micromobility’s key selling points is being a sustainable alternative to other forms of travel. But Uber’s decision calls that messaging into question. The environmental benefits of micromobility While mobility has a variety of environmental benefits, the clearest have to do with emissions and power usage. Specifically, swappable battery scooters can reduce emissions by 51%. And the reduced congestion in cities spurred by bikes and scooters offers a safer environment — physically and sustainably. Many companies in the space have also been developing models that have longer lifetimes before requiring recharging. These developments often mean more rides provided by the same fleet size. And increased utilization often means increased energy efficiency. A recent study also corroborates the benefits of micromobility, measuring the environmental benefits of micromobility through the metric of “CO2 grams equivalent per person per kilometer.” A e-scooter model emits a maximum of 67 CO2 grams per person per kilometer, whereas a car uses a max of 300 CO2 grams. Through this metric, cars can emit over 4 times more than an electric scooter, which has big implications on short trips. Uber’s decision to scrap significant inventory is backpedals on sustainable transportation’s progress Once Uber sold its Jump business to Lime, the company was left with many of the older and less-ridden models. When recent videos emerged of Jump’s spare bike parts being loaded in trucks to be scrapped, there were many voices of disapproval. Many believe that Uber could have found better ways to use the bikes. Critics voiced that Uber could have donated the bikes or sent them in for repairs. Spin, a scooter company owned by Ford, donated 20% of its bicycles when the company switched over to bikes.",https://therising.co/2020/05/30/micromobility-sustainability-uber-scrap-scooters/
"E-scooters just started to return, but Lime, Bird pull them amid protests",Mashable,,National,2020,6,1,"E-scooters just started to return, but Lime, Bird pull them amid protests. Electric scooters are off the streets again. First, the coronavirus outbreak prompted scooter-share companies to remove the devices in March. Just recently more of the two-wheelers were starting to be available to rent again. Now protests in most American cities are keeping the scooters off the road again. Last week George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer, igniting protests against police brutality. Bird and Scoot, both with scooters in cities that are now under curfew like Santa Monica and San Francisco, decided to remove its vehicles where it wasn't considered safe in a bid to comply with any curfews. The company is working with local government agencies to decide when it's safe to bring the scooters back. It's a similar situation for Lime, as a spokesperson explained in an email. The statement read ""Lime has removed scooters from streets and paused service in select U.S. cities following the directives of local regulators. Safety is our top priority and we are actively working with cities to balance this with the need for affordable transportation options."" For Bird, Lime, Scoot, and other scooter companies planning to return to service, new cleaning protocols, adjusted pricing, and free programs for healthcare and frontline workers, among other features were added in recent weeks to make riders feel more comfortable and willing to use the devices. Scooters have the allure of a private transportation option that didn't involve riding the bus or subway with a group of people. When the protests began, they paused any momentum.",https://mashable.com/article/electric-scooters-pulled-protests/
Bird is scrapping thousands of electric scooters in the Middle East,CNBC,NBC,National,2020,6,3,"Bird is scrapping thousands of electric scooters in the Middle East. Between 8,000 and 10,000e-scooters are being destroyed in the Middle East by California scooter sharing start-up Bird, according to sources. They belong to Circ, an e-scooter company that was acquired by Bird in January. Bird shut down its entire Middle East operation as a result of Covid-19. Bird is scrapping thousands of e-scooters in the Middle East and shutting down its operations in the majority of the region as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to five people familiar with the matter.The e-scooters being scrapped belong to Circ, which was acquired by Bird for an undisclosed sum in January. There are between 8,000 and 10,000 Circ scooters across cities in Qatar, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates, according to one former employee and one company source who asked to be kept anonymous as they’ve signed a confidentiality agreement. Bird is paying around $300,000 to have all of Circ’s scooters in the Middle East scrapped, the former employee told CNBC.Bird said it has “temporarily paused operations” in the Middle East because of the hot weather, adding that it is using the break to “recycle” some vehicles. Bird will continue to operate its own scooters in Tel Aviv. “During this pause, we are taking the opportunity to responsibly recycle parts of the old Circ fleet that were previously used in the region,” a Bird spokesperson said. “Following extreme wear and tear, the Circ vehicles no longer met our rigorous quality standards. Selling or re-use of these vehicles would potentially result in safety and reliability issues, which would not have been fair or ethical to the purchasers or potential riders. We look forward to resuming our service throughout more parts of the region later this year.” On March 27, Bird laid off around 30% of its workforce on a Zoom call, or 406 people out of 1,387 employees prior to the layoffs. The entire Circ team in the Middle East, which comprised of around 75 people, was laid off that day and many of them had their last day on May 31, according to the former employee and two other industry sources who preferred to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the situation.“They’re completely shutting down the operation,” said the former employee. “They’ve pulled out and closed the Middle East. Everyone is unemployed.”“They (Bird) hung around after acquiring Circ and said they were backing us because we had 70% market share out here and we were in a very good position. Obviously Covid came in and they decided they didn’t want to do it anymore. We were expecting pay cuts because it was a bad time with obviously no operation but then they turned around and made everyone redundant.”Hot on the heels of Uber JumpGovernments are throwing their weight behind e-scooters and e-bikes as a viable alternative to cars and public transport in the age of the coronavirus. E-scooter sharing companies have marketed themselves as sustainable, environmentally-friendly businesses that cut carbon emissions. But there have been questions about the longevity of their vehicles, with reports suggesting some Bird e-scooters have a life span of just a few months. Last week, it emerged that Uber is scrapping thousands of e-bikes and e-scooters worth millions of dollars after selling its Jump unit to mobility start-up Lime.

Lyft and Citi Bike Stand With the Protesters—Just Not Past 6pm,Vice,Vice Media Group,National,2020,6,4,"Lyft and Citi Bike Stand With the Protesters—Just Not Past 6pm. As cities enact curfews, public bikes and scooters could easily stay in service. Instead, companies are taking a side that hurts protesters and essential workers. In what the company says is a response to a requirement from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office, Citi Bike, the privately-owned bike share system in New York City, announced Wednesday afternoon that it would shut down all service at 6 p.m., or two hours before the city’s temporary 8 p.m. curfew. Revel, which operates electric scooters around a handful of NYC neighborhoods, announced it’d be doing the same thing. In Los Angeles, Bird, Lime, and Lyft-owned electric scooters shut off each night when the city’s curfew hits, suddenly shutting down wherever they may be. In Washington, D.C., the city’s bike share and numerous scooter services have also gone dark this week. Until now, all of these transit options, and others like them across the country with their own Black Lives Matter protest–related curfews, have operated seamlessly throughout the coronavirus pandemic, in many cases even expanding service and eliminating membership costs to better serve essential workers. “During this crisis, we want to do everything we can to help New York City recover, and right now, that means helping healthcare workers get to work safely,” Frank Reig, CEO and co-founder of Revel, told Streetsblog in late March, as the multimillion-dollar scooter company expanded its service area and made rides free for health care workers. Citi Bike similarly granted a month of free membership to first responders, health care workers, and transit employees in New York City under its Critical Workforce Membership Program. “Having seen higher demand for Citi Bikes near our critical hospitals, Lyft [the company that operates Citi Bike] has arrived at a generous and creative plan that will help get first responders where they need to go,” Polly Trottenberg, the commissioner at the city’s Department of Transportation, said at the time. Lime granted free scooter rides to health care workers in more than a dozen cities, as the company’s chief policy officer nodded to the “critical role of micromobility in serving transportation needs now and as we emerge from this crisis.” The message across the board was clear: In a time of crisis, micromobility services were happy to take financial hits in the interest of serving certain communities. In doing so, they also solidified themselves as essential infrastructure, seemingly immune to lockdowns or curfews. Now, as protests highlight the public health crisis of police brutality, these companies’ decisions to accept edicts from local officials to shut down early is not only a significant disservice to essential workers but also potentially dangerous to protesters who’ve come to rely on them. Almost all of these micromobility services operate separately from public transit systems and exist via public-private partnerships with each city. Many also have demonstrated histories of acting without concern for regulation. Revel has more than $30 million in funding and appeared with no municipal oversight in 2019. Bird and Lime have both brought in funding in the hundreds of millions, and scattered their scooters around LA before they were allowed under the law. New York City’s Citi Bike system is the largest micromobility service in the country, with more than 12,000 bikes across more than 700 docking stations. The program’s original sponsor and namesake, Citigroup, is a multibillion-dollar investment banking firm. The bikes now operate under the country’s largest bike share company, Motivate, but since Lyft acquired Motivate in 2018, the rideshare company has taken over its contract with the city. A contract with the city’s Department of Transportation grants Citi Bike total exclusivity on bike shares in New York City, along with pages of requirements it must meet. Lyft, of course, has a noted pattern of filing lawsuits against New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission when given directives the company disagrees with, like orders to pay its workers more and to stop clogging traffic with riderless cars. In 2018, shortly after Lyft took ownership of the program, Citi Bike violated its contractual obligation to keep at least 97 percent of its fleet in operation at all times, when nearly half of the system’s bikes were removed for repairs. At a contract-stipulated penalty of $15 per bike for each day the fleet was below the 97 percent benchmark, Citi Bike eventually accrued nearly $1.4 million in fees owed to the city. The city never collected these damages. Citi Bike has issued a number of acknowledgements of its disrupted service during this “challenging time for the city,” as it alludes that its hands are tied by the mayor’s office. “We recognize what a challenging time this is for the City and are appreciative of all the work by our public officials on behalf of New Yorkers,” a spokesperson for Lyft told VICE via email, echoing the sentiment shared by the Citi Bike Twitter account. “Citi Bike is a public-private partnership, and we were required by our partners in New York City government to discontinue service during curfew hours. We know how disruptive this is to everyone who relies on Citi Bike, especially essential workers, and apologize."" The company is likely concerned that simply releasing the bikes in solidarity with essential workers and protesters, would be a breach of contract, giving the city cause to sue or void the entire agreement. In the past, Lyft has pushed back on city regulations when those regulations threatened their bottom line; why that isn’t an option now, as the essential workers the company recently promised to serve are stripped of access, remains unclear. Plenty clear is the vital role Citi Bike has played in the week’s protests, especially as people scramble to comply with the city’s curfew, with driving banned in most of Manhattan, and cops reportedly blocking the entrances to bridges and subway stations. A bike is a much faster means of getting somewhere, according to Citi Bike’s own slogan, than walking. It also seems distinctly wrong that the NYPD, among the many other tools they have at their disposal, would have unfettered access to bikes they often use to intimidate and kettle protesters, while civilians’ personal transportation access is cut off. Even historically annoying features of the Citi Bikes are now being put to use by protesters: Riding or slowly walking alongside a bike helps a person maintain social distancing, even in a crowd, thanks to its clunky frame. At 45 pounds, they’re a pain in the ass to ride up even a very slight incline, but protesters have used their heft for things like forming a barricade or breaking through something made of a material such as glass. In Paris on Wednesday, protesters even made an effective demonstration out of piling bikes and scooters up and lighting them on fire. Cutting off access to micromobility services on a whim is a transparent protest-squashing move by the cities giving these directives. But it’s hard to believe that the penalty for disobeying or even challenging the orders would be something that any well-funded company couldn’t handle. Releasing the scooters and bikes, in the service of solidarity against police brutality, would certainly have more impact than previous gestures, like Citi Bike's introduction of rainbow bikes during Pride—which, some might remember, began as an anti-police protest.",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/935b3z/restricting-citi-bike-scooter-shares-during-curfew-is-dangerous-for-protestors-essential-workers
Lime adds more JUMP bikes in Seattle but says long-term viability hinges on city allowing scooters,GeekWire,,National,2020,8,5,"Lime will double the number of bikes available to rent in Seattle, but says the long-term viability of the service depends on whether city officials also allow its scooter-share program to operate. The company confirmed to GeekWire that it plans to have 1,000 JUMP bikes in Seattle by the end of August, and 2,000 by this fall. That’s nearly the size of the fleet that was in circulation before bike-share services disappeared from city streets earlier this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lime began re-deploying a small fleet of bikes in Seattle in June, following the company’s acquisition of JUMP, which was previously owned and operated by Uber. Over the next few weeks, Lime will be ramping up its fleet of JUMP bikes in Seattle under the expectation that a scooter pilot will launch soon. The economics of dockless bike-share have never quite penciled out, as graveyards of discarded bicycles around the world show. Lime believes it can still operate bike-share in Seattle and other cities, but only if it can also rent more profitable electric scooters to offset losses. Last year, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan pledged to launch a scooter-share pilot this spring in the city but the process has become bogged down by bureaucratic hurdles and other municipal priorities. Durkan’s office did not respond to questions about when the scooter pilot is expected to launch. “We want to see JUMP bikes here in 10 years,” said Jonathan Hopkins, Lime’s director of strategic development. “We want to see JUMP bikes here in 20 years, but there’s no way to do that if it’s operating at a loss.” Operating a shared bike costs two to three times as much as a scooter, but bikes are rented about one-third as often, according to Hopkins. Bikes also cost more to maintain and take up more storage space in the vans and trucks used to pull them off streets for servicing. “That’s not to say that bikes aren’t good,” Hopkins said. “They’re extraordinarily good. They’re essential in the city because we have hills and some people like to ride bikes, some people like to ride scooters. We do need them here. They are a public benefit. We can make the economics work when they’re paired with scooters.” One of Durkan’s top priorities for the scooter-share pilot is safety. Reports indicate that scooter-related injuries are on the rise, particularly among riders who don’t wear helmets. Hopkins said that should add urgency to the pilot launch because it will allow riders to learn to use scooters when there is more light and dry weather. The Seattle Department of Transportation and cycling advocates have warned that scooters could make bike-share less appealing. In 2018, scooter ridership surpassed bike-share nationally for the first time and many mobility companies are prioritizing scooters over bikes. JUMP bikes are currently available for rent in the Lime app and they will also be rentable through Uber’s app in the coming weeks, Hopkins said. In addition to Seattle, Lime operates bike-share in Denver and Washington D.C. It plans to add JUMP bikes to more cities this year. Lime’s original green bikes are no longer in operation. Lime says bike-share is safer than riding public transportation because COVID-19 is more likely to be transferred from person-to-person than from surfaces, per CDC guidance. The company uses CDC-recommended products to sanitize bikes regularly and advises riders to wash their hands after trips. Lime and Uber announced they would join forces in May as both companies suffered blows from the pandemic.

Shared bike and scooter companies are freaking out over a new bill in California,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,8,25,"Shared bike and scooter companies are freaking out over a new bill in California. AB 1286 ‘threatens the very existence of shared micromobility.’ Shared bike and scooter companies in California are urging state legislators to oppose a bill that would “threaten the very existence of micromobility” in the state. The bill, AB 1286, would prohibit companies from including language in their terms of service asking riders to waive liability for injuries — a provision shared mobility companies claim would essentially force them to shut down if enacted. The bill is a product of the pre-pandemic times, first introduced in February 2019 and passed a few months later in May by the California State Assembly. The bill laid dormant for months until last week, when it passed a committee vote in the Senate. That prompted the bike and scooter industry in the state to spring into action. The section of the bill giving micromobility operators the most anxiety reads: The shared mobility provider agreement between the provider and a user shall not contain a provision by which the user waives, releases, or in any way limits their legal rights or remedies under the agreement. Bike and scooter operators argue this will expose them to lawsuits from riders who are injured while using their vehicles, including those injuries caused by poor road conditions, reckless driving, or rider negligence. The ability to waive liability for injuries is a legal protection granted to other recreation and transportation rental businesses, such as ski resorts, car rental agencies, and white water rafting companies, they state. Without that protection, they can be litigated out of existence, they say. To be sure, riders who sign liability waivers can still seek compensation from shared mobility companies for injuries and safety violations. Case in point, Lime and Bird were both sued in San Francisco Superior Court recently by dozens of customers who were injured while riding their scooters. In response, the shared mobility industry and their allies have issued a flurry of letters warning state legislators that the bill could have the unintended consequence of killing off the shared bike and scooter industry in California. “Other cities around the world have recognized this phenomenon and are rushing to expand access to clean, socially distant micromobility,” a coalition of companies including Uber, Lyft, Bird, Lime, Spin, and others, write in a letter to Senate leaders in California. “But AB 1286 would instead legislate it out of existence, sending California down a regressive path and adding tens of millions of car trips each year to our cities’ streets.” Bike advocates agree the bill would irreparably damage the shared mobility industry at a time when ridership is picking up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. AB 1286 would “stifle the growth of a thriving industry at a time when the state is in the greatest need of these services,” the North American Bikeshare Association and People for Bikes, two leading bike advocacy groups in the US, write in a joint letter. Shared bikes and scooters can replace car trips and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue. And the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need for more alternate modes of transportation for people who want to avoid crowded subways and buses. They also claim the bill will render their businesses practically uninsurable, and the main insurance provider for the shared mobility industry is backing them up. Apollo, the insurance provider for Lime, Bird, Wheels, Razor, Spin, and Jump, wrote in a brief letter to the California Senate that it “would not be able to insure the micromobility industry in California for the foreseeable future” if the bill passes. Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi, the bill’s lead sponsor, said when the bill was first introduced, the intention was to protect riders as well as pedestrians and others from injury while riding shared bikes and scooters. He noted that four scooter riders were killed in recent weeks and cited a Journal of the American Medical Association study that found 249 scooter riders treated for injuries in just two Southern California emergency rooms last year. Of those injured, 96 percent were riders, 40 percent suffered head injuries, and only 5.7 percent wore helmets. “E-scooters and other shared mobility devices can be fun, affordable, and eco-friendly ways to get around,” Muratsuchi said in a press release last year. “However, like any new innovation, we need to make sure it is safe both for users and for pedestrians, with basic consumer protections. This bill would protect consumers of these services as well as the general public by requiring cities and counties to adopt basic safety rules, as well as providing for consumer protections that would protect users and third parties in the event of an injury.” (A spokesperson for the assembly member did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Scooter and bike companies have encouraged riders to wear helmets, as well as lobbied city governments to spend more money installing protected bike lanes and other street infrastructure that has been shown to improve safety for riders. Shared bike and scooter operators aren’t the only ones sweating it out over legislation in California. Uber and Lyft were on the brink of shutting down in the state over the gig workers’ law that makes it more difficult to classify drivers as independent contractors, but they were able to avoid it after a judge issued an emergency ruling giving them more time to respond.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400842/bike-scooter-california-bill-ab1286-liability-waiver
A bill that could have ended California’s scooter and bike businesses has been amended,The Verge,Vox,National,2020,8,26,"A bill that could have ended California’s scooter and bike businesses has been amended. The shared mobility industry overcomes its first major existential threat. A bill in the California state legislature that shared bike and scooter companies feared would have ended their businesses has been amended. A previous version of the bill, AB 1286, included language that would have prohibited companies like Bird, Lime, and Uber from using liability waivers — a provision these companies claimed would essentially force them to shut down if enacted. Without these waivers, shared mobility companies could be held liable for all kinds of injuries and accidents, including those resulting from poor road infrastructure, reckless driving, or negligent riders. But after a massive outcry from the bike and scooter industry, the bill has been amended to remove the language regarding liability waivers — thus eliminating the main threat posed to shared mobility providers. These operators feel as if this bill was the first major existential threat they have faced, and they feel pretty good about having prevailed over it. “As COVID is prompting many Californians to rethink how they get around, this change is a powerful acknowledgement that shared bikes and scooters are here to stay in our cities,” Sam Sadle, Senior Director for Government Relations at Lime, said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with cities and the state to encourage open-air, socially-distanced, and sustainable transportation options going forward.” An analysis of the bill produced by the state Senate earlier this month makes note of the strong opposition from shared mobility providers, and it even acknowledges “such waivers are generally permitted and widely used.” Still, waivers laid out in user agreements and terms of service with customers must be “clear, unambiguous, and explicit,” the senators conclude. The bill is intended to prevent scooter and bike companies from going rogue and littering the street with two-wheeled vehicles before a clear set of safety rules and guidelines have been established by the governing authorities. In other words, it’s designed to stop scooter companies like Bird and Lime from doing exactly what they did when they first kicked off the concept of dockless micromobility three years ago: dropping their vehicles on the street overnight in defiance of local rules. Cities and counties would be required to “adopt safety rules before e-scooter and other shared mobility service providers offer any device for rent or use,” according to Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi, the bill’s lead sponsor. “The bill would also require the service providers to provide minimum insurance to protect riders as well as pedestrians and others in the event of an injury.” Apollo, the main insurance provider for the shared mobility industry in California, said it would not be able to insure scooter and bike companies without liability waivers. But now that the language has been removed, that presumably won’t be a problem.",https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402557/scooter-bike-california-bill-liability-waiver-amended
U.S. Scooter Ridership Surged in 2019. Now What?,City Lab,Bloomberg,National,2020,8,27,"U.S. Scooter Ridership Surged in 2019. Now What? A new report from the National Association of City Transportation Officials shows big gains for e-scooters before the pandemic — and signs that the micromobility boom could go on. Last year, when the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) released its annual report on shared micromobility services, the message was clear: The dorky-looking electric scooters that had appeared on the streets of American cities over the course 2018 were more than glorified children’s toys. The battery-boosted rentable vehicles were a serious urban transportation technology that racked up more than 38 million trips — a healthy chunk of the 84 million total trips that traditional docked bikeshare programs and less-traditional dockless services tallied. Now NACTO is releasing its 2019 Shared Micromobility Report, which shows scooter ridership continuing its growth trajectory, and large bikeshare systems expanding usage at a healthy clip. American cities played host to 136 million shared micromobility trips in 2019, including station-based bikeshare, dockless bikeshare and shared e-scooters. To put those numbers in perspective: Two thirds of all shared micromobility trips since 2010 have been made in the last two years. 2019’s shared micromobility ridership alone would be the equivalent of the fifth-busiest subway or light rail system in the country. “What we’re seeing is there’s tremendous demand to make short trips easy, which is what micromobility does,” said Alex Engel, the program manager for communications at NACTO. “We see that with the explosive ridership growth and the durability of ridership in many, many places.” Of course, these findings come with a big, virus-shaped asterisk. Micromobility ridership, like all forms of transportation, took a major hit in 2020 when the pandemic-related stay-at-home orders brought America’s cities to a virtual standstill. And the enduring impact of Covid-19 is continuing to depress ridership, as students, tourists and office workers — all e-scooter power users — have yet to resume their pre-pandemic patterns. But there are signs that this industry is still coming into its own, eating up a growing share of the U.S. transportation pie and playing an essential role in keeping cities moving during the coronavirus crisis. Most of the micromobility growth has come from e-scooters. Scooter ridership increased from 38.5 million in 2018 to 88.5 million in 2019, a growth rate of more than 100%, while station-based bikeshare ridership increased 10%, from 36.5 million to 40 million. The 2019 scooter explosion came as the industry expanded its geographic footprint considerably to 109 cities, up 45% from 2018. The six largest scooter markets, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego and Washington, D.C., accounted for a bit more than a third of all scooter ridership. (The report does not provide city- or company-specific numbers as part of its data-sharing agreements with micromobility providers. NACTO cross-checks data from the providers with city governments to ensure accuracy.) Docked bikeshare, on the other hand, saw virtually all of its growth and 87% of total ridership in its six largest markets: New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston, Honolulu and the Bay Area. The rest of the country’s adoption has lagged: Three-quarters of all docked bikeshare systems recorded ridership decreases in 2019. The poor performance of smaller-market bikeshare systems points to another one of the report’s findings: Scooters get the highest utilization (trips per vehicle per day) in fleets with fewer total scooters, while docked bikeshare bikes get the highest utilization in the largest systems. “Dynamic” caps that increase as utilization grows are helping cities identify the proper size of their scooter fleets, Engel says. “There’s a trade-off here. You want your system to be utilized, but you also want it to be accessible.” This trade-off already prompted something of a micromobility reckoning at the end of 2019, as Lime and Lyft (which also owns most of the country’s largest bikeshare systems) pulled their scooters out of several cities in order to focus on their most popular markets. Around the same time, Uber handed off its JUMP business, purveyors of popular dockless electric bikes, to Lime. The NACTO report sheds more light on how different kinds of sites favor various forms of shared micromobility. Scooters tends to thrive in sprawling, warm-weather cities, while docked bikeshare does best in more dense, older cities. (The sweet spot for both: Washington, D.C.) The regulatory environment plays a role, too. Strict geo-fences and vehicle caps on scooters in cities like Chicago and San Francisco, and outright bans in New York, Boston, Seattle and Philadelphia, have hampered their growth there. Some of those regulations, including New York’s ban, are starting to loosen. Shared bikes and scooters also tend to be used for different trip types. Scooter rides in 2019 averaged only one mile, were often concentrated in entertainment districts, and tended to be more common in the afternoons, evenings and weekends. Station-based bikeshare members’ trips averaged 1.5 miles and were highly concentrated during commuting hours. As Washington, D.C., demonstrates, these two modes can happily coexist. Of course, those figures are just a snapshot of the Before Times: Patterns of work and leisure have since been upended by the pandemic, and 2020 is shaping up to offer a very different picture. According to the report’s brief speculation about this year, trip length and type are some of the biggest changes shared micromobility has seen since the coronavirus arrived. While scooters hogged the micromobility spotlight over the past couple of years, it’s docked bikeshare that’s been the workhorse of the Covid-19 recovery. Even in the depths of the pandemic in April and May, bikeshare ridership in the six major markets decreased an average of 44%, lower than plunges in driving and transit usage. Since then, ridership has bounced back to close to normal, as more people hop on bikes for neighborhood errands, exercise, or to avoid public transit. Citi Bike’s 2.1 million rides in July 2020 were just a shade off July 2019’s ridership of 2.2 million. New York City subway ridership, meanwhile, remains at about 20% of normal. Other bikeshare comebacks haven’t been quite as dramatic as Citi Bike’s, “but we’re seeing really strong ridership in pretty much all of the major established systems,” Engel said. Scooter use is gradually recovering, too. For both bikes and scooters, rides have grown longer during the pandemic, and have shifted from downtowns to more residential neighborhoods. The introduction of boosted e-bikes in more Lyft-owned bikeshare systems is also yielding higher utilization and longer trips, according to a company spokesperson. Although America’s relatively meager pandemic bike lanes and shared streets programs pale in comparison to those in cities like Paris and Bogotá, several U.S. cities have limited car traffic to encourage other road users during the coronavirus emergency, which could be inducing more people to try micromobility, as a recent blog post from the scooter company Spin explored. More broadly, the pandemic may end up being a micromobility industry boon: Bike shops are reporting shortages of entry-level bicycles, and sales of e-bikes in the U.S. increased 190% this June compared to June 2019, as Axios recently reported. Consumers weary of paying by the minute can buy their own Bird scooters at Walmart or BestBuy. These developments stand in contrast to the early days of bikeshare programs, when bike shops in New York City worried they would go out of business, or when e-scooters were the bane of local cycling clubs. The longer-term reality could look more like a virtuous cycle of car-free transportation, whether shared or owned, seated or standing, electric or pedal-powered. “The more people you have out in the streets riding, the more that there is true safety in numbers,” Engel said. “And the more it encourages other people to ride, too.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/how-big-was-2019-s-scooter-boom-and-what-s-next
Get Ready for a Swarm of Rental Scooters—the Next Thing You’ll Hate About New Portland,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,6,1,"Get Ready for a Swarm of Rental Scooters—the Next Thing You’ll Hate About New Portland. The Portland Bureau of Transportation has invited five companies to pilot e-scooters in the city. Starting this summer, Portland will be the latest testing ground for fleets of dockless e-scooters. In a May 29 letter to five different scooter companies—Skip, Spin, LimeBike, Bird and Goat—commissioner Dan Saltzman announced plans for a four-month e-scooter pilot project, which will start this summer. As the Oregonian first reported, the pilot program will mirror Biketown by allowing customers rent a scooter with their smart phone. But because they are dockless, the scooters can be dropped off anywhere in the city. In the cities where e-scooter's have been unveiled—like Los Angeles and San Francisco—careless riders have sparked livid backlash by haphazardly dropping off scooters wherever they please. ""Cities have been shocked to discover that thousands of electric scooters have been dropped onto their sidewalks seemingly overnight,"" a recent New York Times article notes. ""Often, the companies ignored all the usual avenues of getting city approval to set up shop."" Dylan Rivera, a spokesperson for PBOT, told The Oregonian that the city is proceeding cautiously in attempts to avoid suffering the same fate as California. Rivera said the city doesn't want to see ""dozens, if not hundreds of scooters"" dumped around. During the trial period, Saltzman's letter outlines, companies will be required to ""report on and mitigate impacts"" related to pedestrian safety, scooter access for people with disabilities, compliance with state laws and anonymized trip data (origin, destination, length). While LimeBike and others are invited to trail scooter programs in Portland, Saltzman—wary of transportation companies after Uber steamrolled into town with deceptive practices in 2014—says that any company that begins operation without city approval will be fined and have scooters confiscated. Saltzman's caution is well-founded, critics of shared e-scooter programs note, as Portland still lacks functional bike lanes in parts of the city and scooters aren't allowed on sidewalks. Those concerns don't faze Gabriel Scheer, director of development for LimeBike, the Silicon Valley-based e-scooter company. Scheer told The Oregonian, ""Let's go to Cully. Let's go to Lents. Let's go to the areas that aren't being served by Biketown,"" adding that data on ridership habits could prompt bike lane infrastructure improvements in areas like East Portland. So look forward to a summer of dodging tourists e-scooting on Portland sidewalks. But also maybe snag one yourself and test it out by rolling through a Burgerville drive thru.

"I Just Lived Through the Invasion of San Francisco by Electronic Scooters. Portland, You Have No Idea What You’re In For.",Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,6,5,"I Just Lived Through the Invasion of San Francisco by Electronic Scooters. Portland, You Have No Idea What You’re In For. “I ride my bike to work, and they’re just all over the bike lane. People are riding the wrong way with headphones in their ears.” Everything seemed so normal the day the motorized scooters came to my town. What I remember from that March morning: walking out of my apartment in San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood and seeing a scooter lying abandoned on a street corner. Then I started noticing them everywhere. Nestled snugly against apartment buildings and grocery stores. At bus stops, on the Metro, slung over a shoulder. ""Yeah, it was like…overnight! They just suddenly appeared,"" says Alex Sorensen, who works as a barista in SoMa. ""I ride my bike to work, and they're just all over the bike lane. People are riding the wrong way with headphones in their ears."" There's a moment in every zombie apocalypse thriller when the world gets quiet. It's right before the hysteria descends. Portland is in this moment. San Francisco was once, too—three months ago. The Bay Area is now consumed by electronic scooters. Think little kids' scooters—the handlebar-equipped training wheels before you graduate to skateboards—but with 250-watt motors. Estimates of how many were deposited on San Francisco streets range wildly, from 2,000 to 4,000, all of them appearing virtually overnight. Last week, Portland transportation officials announced they're planning to introduce a four-month pilot program for the dockless scooters later this summer. Officials have also emphasized that the pilot program in no way guarantees the scooters will stick around. That may be true. But take it from me, somebody who has lived through San Francisco's scooter madness: This is the single most divisive thing to hit Silicon Valley since the Google Bus. Another former Portlander, Nigel Duara of Vice News, took a look at San Francisco's scooter nightmare last month: Hillary Martin, a student at the California College of the Arts, says the scooters initially didn't bother her. ""They seemed like a good way to get around town,"" she says. ""But then over time, I realized these are really inconveniently placed. They're just taking up space on sidewalks!"" The first wave of the invasion came from California-based startups like Bird, Spin and LimeBike. These tech companies advertise cheap, simple and environment-saving transportation. Much like the introduction of Uber on Portland's streets in 2014, the scooters arrived without any approval or guidance from city officials. Since the scooters are dockless, they can be locked and dropped off at any location, including the middle of the sidewalk, in the roadway, leaned up against cars or lying in the bushes. That makes them tough to navigate for people using wheelchairs or strollers. The scooters are virtually silent and can go up to 15 mph. They outpace most bicycles and are difficult to hear coming until they're already upon you. It's not just the bike lanes. Because the scooters were first deposited on the sidewalks, users erroneously assumed it was legal to ride them on the sidewalks. (Portland officials say sidewalk riding will be outlawed.) It's on the sidewalk where scooters become hazardous. People have tripped over scooters left outside their doorsteps. Others have been hit by riders cruising down the sidewalk. And they seem to invite irresponsibility. Less than a week after the scooter invasion, I saw a scooter rider get hit by a car underneath an overpass near the Mission District. As police arrived on the scene, drunken scooter riders careened by without a care in the world. Former Portlander John Sepulvado—I work with him at a Bay Area public radio station—has a favorite example of how scooters seem to make people lose all sense. ""I was driving in downtown San Francisco when I saw two people start making a boxer stance. They were literally fighting over who was going to ride the scooter in that moment,"" says Sepulvado. ""Like, grown dudes, fighting over a green and white scooter."" A backlash was predictable. I've seen people kick scooters over or deface them with graffiti and, on occasion, excrement. Others have just started stealing them—""hot wiring"" the scooters by quite literally ripping out their motors—prompting companies to install ear-piercing alarms that sing outside your stoop for hours. Disgruntled residents have thrown scooters into garbage cans and Oakland's Lake Merritt. Last week, around 60 tenants' rights activists blocked nine tech buses carrying Google employees to the Silicon Valley campus with a scooter blockade. They claim the scooters are a symbol of ""techsploitation"" and gentrification in the city. And that's a common refrain here: Scooters go hand in hand with tech transplants who don't care about who they inconvenience or run over. If I recall correctly, Portland has its own issues to work out on that front. In some ways, scooters are the least of the problem. Maybe Portland, with its tighter regulations and companies that have pledged to work with City Hall, will find the little machines fit in better. Good luck with that. And look out behind you.

Scooters coming to Portland? We took one for a spin. Here’s our review,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2018,6,18,"Scooters coming to Portland? We took one for a spin. Here’s our review. I have seen your electric scooter future, Portland. It’s fun. It’s dorky. It’s wobbly, at least initially. It’s going to be weird. At equal points, I imagine you’ll be enamored with the convenience of a new form of transportation, or enraged at the sight of a scooter illegally blasting down a sidewalk. LimeBike, one of five companies potentially in line to participate in a four-month pilot project this summer, let The Oregonian/OregonLive to take one of the scooters for a ride in downtown Portland. I lived to tell the tale, and I didn’t leave the scooter errantly on the sidewalk afterward. By now you’ve likely heard tales of other city’s experiences with dockless scooters, the latest transportation craze whereby users can rent the two-wheeled devices on a smart phone and leave them anyplace they’d please when they get to their destination. Portland, still feeling the burn from its early rocky relationship with Uber, another Silicon Valley-startup that sought to turn transportation on its head, is eyeing the industry warily. It is only guaranteeing a trial period for scooters, and it has concerns about pedestrian safety and how to ensure users won’t discard scooters willy-nilly. As of Friday, no starting date has been announced. Meanwhile, electric bikes and dockless bike companies are likely next in line. Here are some thoughts on my scooter experience: - It’s fun: I had never tried an electric scooter before, and as a giant person, I’d never gravitated toward razor scooters or other non-electric scooting cousins as a youth. One of my first instincts once I started to ride was to crack a big smile like the big doofus I am. - Signals: I am not one of those bicyclists you see nonchalantly riding sans hands, sitting back in smug satisfaction while essentially screaming with all their might, silently, to those around them, “Look at how cool I am.” No, I had difficulty taking my hand off of the handlebars to signal a left or right turn on the scooter. My balance wasn’t great initially either, and it wasn’t comfortable for me to signal when turning. I’m a decent athlete, and I have big feet, but it took me a few minutes to figure out the most comfortable place to put them initially. I could see people not using signals because they don’t feel comfortable going one-handed. It doesn’t take a very stable genius to imagine what riding one of these scooters might feel like while tipsy. Keep an eye out for that behavior. - Helmets: Did you know it’s illegal to operate an e-scooter in Oregon, no matter how old you are, without a helmet? No? Sorry to burst your bubble. If you think few people wear helmets on the Biketown rides, imagine what it will be like on the scooters. - Bike lanes: I chose to take the e-scooter on a spin through Tom McCall Waterfront Park and up and down Better Naito. It felt comfortable in that setting but felt a little less safe on the other side of Naito Parkway, when I rode in the bike lane. The suspension on the scooter I rode was not exactly top-of-the-line. You feel the imperfections, let’s say, in our street infrastructure. Depending on where you are in the city, this could be an extremely bumpy ride and a deal breaker, forcing people onto …. - Sidewalks: I am definitely not looking forward to the scooter revolution hitting Portland’s sidewalks. I’m pretty confident biking while in the legal right of way, either on a bike lane or the traffic lane. But given some of the concerns I mentioned earlier, I could see users ditching the street for the smoother sidewalk areas. The scooters aren’t silent, but they aren’t exactly loud either. The bell on my demo model didn’t work well, but I would hope scooterites use their bell to alert pedestrians if they are indeed riding illegally on the sidewalk. Because you’re unlikely to be passing many bicyclists on a scooter. - Practical uses: It’s not difficult to imagine the everyday benefits a scooter provides. If you’re trying to make it to a meeting from one part of downtown to the other, a scooter is a good bet. I see people using them as a last-mile option to avoid walking or waiting for a bus or train. I would be hesitant to ride on my own commute, which would put me on North Interstate Avenue or North Greeley Street. Even Vancouver seems a bit of a dicey proposition. Going downhill is a bit hair-raising. While it tops out at around 15 miles per hour, it feels a lot faster when on a scooter. - No sweat: Unlike hoofing it from my office in downtown to the Pearl District on a Biketown, I can’t imagine sweating much while riding an e-scooter. This makes it an ideal way to get around if you’re wearing business attire or otherwise don’t want to get your sweat on. - Hills: I would tend to avoid going up or down hills when renting a scooter. Even heading up the moderate incline near the bowl at Waterfront Park felt like I was straining the scooter’s powers. It sounded like a children’s electric Jeep that hadn’t been charged in weeks. - East Portland: I am most curious about whether the e-scooters are indeed dispersed widely in parts of town such as east Portland, where there’s a lack of frequent transit service. But there are huge alarm bells about that scenario, too. Some of the most dangerous intersections and high crash corridors are those areas east of 122nd Avenue, and sidewalks and bike lanes are often patchy or haphazard at best. Scooters could be useful additions to the transit system, but they could also put people at risk in parts of town already prone to traffic fatalities.

Will Portland get shareable electric scooters by the end of July?,Katu,ABC,"Portland, OR",2018,7,5,"Will Portland get shareable electric scooters by the end of July? The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) says it's opening permit applications for a four-month shareable electric scooter pilot program. The first such pilot in Oregon, shared electric scooter companies can apply and could being operating in the city by the end of July. PBOT will use the 120-day pilot to help the city determine whether or not e-scooters can support Portland's mobility, equity, safety and climate actions goals. PBOT says the total number of scooters allowed to operate in the city will be capped at 2,500, with a requirement that companies deploy approximately 20 percent of their fleet each day in East Portland. Applications for participating in the pilot program are due by July 12. Shared electric scooters are an emerging technology, similar to bike-share programs. The service provides scooters available to rent for one-way trips for a fee. E-scooters have been a hit in several major U.S. cities including Austin, Texas and Washington, D.C. During the pilot program, PBOT says scooter companies will be expected to report on and mitigate impacts to safety and access of people walking, safety and access for people with disabilities and compliance with state law. City officials will determine whether and under what circumstances electric scooter sharing may be permitted to continue operating.

E-Scooter Company Lime Begins Recruiting Portland “Juicers” to Charge Its Machines Overnight,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,7,17,"E-Scooter Company Lime Begins Recruiting Portland “Juicers” to Charge Its Machines Overnight. A Lime job posting went up on Craigslist today. In another sign that dockless scooters may soon take over Portland, prominent e-scooter company Lime posted an ad on Craiglist today looking for ""juicers."" Juicers, the listing notes, are contract workers who use their own cars at night to pick up, charge and re-distribute Lime scooters around Portland. ""Charge scooters, make money while you sleep,"" the job posting reads, advertising $150 or more a night to interested parties. The ad is posted even though Lime has yet to be issued a formal permit by the Portland Bureau of Transportation, spokesperson John Brady tells WW. Brady says the agency is still processing applications it received earlier this month. ""I can't comment on what Lime decides to list [on Craigslist],"" Brady says, ""but [PBOT] has made very clear that the only way to operate in Portland is by applying and successfully getting a permit."" The company didn't directly address the question of why it's hiring juicers when it hasn't yet been approved—but says it's eager for those permits. ""We are enthusiastically awaiting word from PBOT, and stand eager to bring Portlanders a new mobility option,"" says Gabriel Scheer, director of strategic development at Lime. In a June letter from city commissioner Dan Saltzman announcing the four-month long e-scooter pilot program, Saltzman warned that any company that begins operation in Portland without prior approval will be fined and have its scooters confiscated. Dockless scooters have received mixed reviews in the cities where they have been deployed. One common complaint is that abandoned scooters are discarded haphazardly on sidewalks at the end of a rider's journey. Juicers would theoretically mitigate the clutter issue while keeping scooters charged. In San Francisco, tech blog Recode reports, there are about 200 juicers employed by Lime.

E-Scooters Debut in Portland? City Hall Says It’s Just a Tech Glitch,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,7,23,"E-Scooters Debut in Portland? City Hall Says It’s Just a Tech Glitch. PBOT says the scooters are waiting in warehouses, for now. Eager e-scooter users who preemptively downloaded Lime's smart phone app found something surprising last night: rides available to rent in Portland. That's ahead of the city issuing any formal permits for its four-month pilot program, says Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesperson John Brady. The agency has been keeping a close eye on scooter companies after announcing in June that any entity that begins operation without explicit permission from the city will be fined and have scooters confiscated. Brady says that when PBOT spotted activity on Lime's app this morning, it worked quickly to ""get to the bottom of it,"" and learned that no scooters are actually on the street yet. ""They didn't jump the gun,"" Brady tells WW. ""Lime is getting ready to launch and so it has scooters on site in warehouses that will manifest on the app."" A spokesperson for Lime declined to comment on the company's plans for launching, citing PBOT's still-pending permitting process.

Electric scooters coming to Portland as early as this week,Katu,ABC,"Portland, OR",2018,7,25,"Electric scooters coming to Portland as early as this week. Scooters are coming to PDX! The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced Wednesday that it has issued the first two permits to operate shared electric scooters in Portland. The permits were issued to the companies Skip and Bird, and PBOT officials say they expect that the scooters could be available to rent as soon as this week. The permits were issued as part of PBOT's recently launched Shared Scooter Pilot Program. The 120-day pilot will run until November 20, after which PBOT will conduct and evaluation of the program to determine whether scooters are compatible with the city's transportation system. ""Portlanders will now have a chance to try this new way of getting around, and we'll have the opportunity to see if scooters work in Portland and help us meet our safety, mobility, equity and climate action goals,"" said interim Transportation Director Chris Warner in a press release Wednesday. Twenty percent of a company's scooter fleet will be deployed in East Portland, as city leaders are working on making it easier for people there to move around car-free. ""Transit systems aren't always designed to serve them, so its' been good to serve people who need to ride scooters to get to transit and to get to work,"" said Sanjay Dastoor, co-founder and CEO of Skip, one of the two scooter companies that received a permit Wednesday. Skip has had success during a similar pilot program in Washington, D.C. which required companies to put their scooters in every ward of the city. Dastoor says the first wave of Skip scooters will arrive in Portland starting next week. At least 200 scooters will be out on the streets, then a week later the company will ramp up. ""It's really important to us that we deploy this in a reasonable manner and that customers are supported in a good way,"" Dastoor said. ""It's important to think of quality and reliability in our vehicles."" By state law, scooter riders must wear a helmet and cannot ride on sidewalks. The scooters cannot be used in city parks, and riders will be required to park scooters on the sidewalk close to the curb so as not to interfere with pedestrians. As a condition of the permits, the two companies are required to educate scooter users about safe riding and proper parking behavior, according to PBOT. Since five companies have been invited, the pilot program will have at most 2,500 scooters on the streets. ",https://katu.com/news/local/electric-scooters-coming-to-portland-as-early-as-this-week

These rental scooters have been the target of widespread ire in California cities where they've launched. So WW asked readers on Twitter to send reports of questionable scooting choices to scooters@week.com. It didn't work. Alternative transit activists seized the opportunity to remind us that, in their view, the real menace on Portland's streets are cars.

Portland’s e-scooter trial rolling along and ramping up,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2018,8,1,"Portland’s e-scooter trial rolling along and ramping up. Electric scooters are here, and the sky isn’t falling – yet. One week into Portland’s electric scooter honeymoon, it’s been largely smooth sailing. “It’s going very well,” said John Brady, Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesman. Just one scooter has gone swimming in the river so far, and city officials and e-scooter companies say Portland’s four-month trial period is off to an encouraging start. Brady said people took more than 5,000 rides on the 400 scooters on city streets last weekend. “That’s a real indication of the popularity,” he said Wednesday. “People are really excited to try this out.” The program is just getting started. The number of available scooters is expected to more than double over the next week alone. Portland’s permitting process mandated a slow scooter rollout, but Lime and Bird scooters can now more than triple their fleets to 683 scooters per company. “There is still a need to do more rider education about the rules of the road and safe riding,” Brady said. Portland could ask the companies, which already prompt users to obey helmet and sidewalk laws, to do more education and outreach. The city is considering performing scooter stings, where employees case the streets to educate riders about the rules of the road. A third permitted company, Skip, said it would roll out anywhere from 100 to 200 scooters citywide Thursday, depending on the company’s readiness. Skip’s permit allows up to 450 scooters. A fourth company, HOPR, is still awaiting permit approval. All told, Portland will allow as many as 2,500 scooters to operate until Nov. 20. Portland’s regulations are some of the stiffest in the nation. The city charges the companies a 25-cent-per-ride surcharge, and applicants had to pay $5,250 to operate here. Brady said Portland wanted to be proactive and innovative in approaching the scooter rental program. Dockless e-scooter companies continue to spark national headlines when scooters are either discarded haphazardly on sidewalks, destroyed or otherwise cause a nuisance when riders operate illegally on sidewalks. And while some riders have illegally ridden the devices on sidewalks in Portland, and few appear to be wearing helmets, the city has not seen a rash of complaints. The Bureau of Transportation has received approximately 70 complaints about scooter riders. The agency installed signs on the multi-use path at River Place in Southwest Portland to divert scooter riders to bike lanes. Riding in parks or on the Eastbank Esplanade is illegal. Portland police said they are not aware of any citations issued for scooter scofflaws yet. “There have been several verbal warnings that have been provided,” Sgt. Chris Burley said. He wasn’t aware of any accidents reported as of Wednesday. Brady said the city regularly gives the scooter companies feedback on how things are going. Initially, the companies were not distributing a portion of the scooters to east Portland as required by the permit. “That’s been fixed,” he said. The scooters, which typically can travel 30 miles before recharging, appear to be less used in east Portland, where the companies’ real-time maps indicate those vehicles have more power remaining in the batteries. Bird did not immediately answer questions about the first week in Portland. Barrett Brown, operations manager for Lime in Portland, said overall the company received ""very good"" feedback from city leaders. ""Most has been focused on Lime continuing to expand and making scooters available in other parts of the city,"" he said in an email of the city's comments, ""which will be a major focus on Friday with our next fleet count increase."" Lime said more than 3,700 riders had logged 11,000 miles in Portland in the first week. The company plans to hit its maximum 683 vehicles soon. Sanjay Dastoor, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based Skip, said his company was excited to deploy its fleet in Portland this week. Skip currently operates solely in Washington, D.C., where it qualified for a permit. Dastoor said Skip scooters have a wider foot base than their competitors’ scooters and are more stable. He said the scooters have a front suspension and double lights on the front and back of the rides. Dastoor said he’s excited to be in Portland because of the city’s bike network, the TriMet system and the proximity to the company headquarters in the Bay Area. Ultimately, he said, scooters can help make Portland safer for cyclists. Some scooter riders will inevitably be using bike lanes for the first time, which he believes will help bicycle users who have long pushed for better bike infrastructure. “That’s such an amazing alliance,” he said. “People use sidewalks when the bike lanes just aren’t there,” he said. “We are huge advocates of protected bike lane infrastructure.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/news/erry-2018/08/fb28585e547069/portlands-escooter-trial-going.html
I Signed on to Portland’s Latest Side Hustle: Collecting Electric Scooters and Charging Them at Night,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,8,7,"I Signed on to Portland’s Latest Side Hustle: Collecting Electric Scooters and Charging Them at Night. “It’s like Pokémon Go, but at least I’m getting paid.” Sandy Ninh prowls the streets of Portland at dusk, looking for electric scooters to take home. By day, Ninh, 26, works at a Portland pharmacy. But for the past week, she has packed as many e-scooters as she can fit each night into the back of her Toyota Corolla—about six—charging them overnight at her Hillsboro home and putting them back on the street the next morning. For this task, she is paid as much as $10 a scooter by the tech startup Bird. ""It's like Pokémon Go,"" Ninh says, ""but at least I'm getting paid."" Electric scooters—as controversial as they are convenient in the cities where they've been deployed—hit Portland on July 26. Scooter companies Lime, Bird and Skip added 600 scooters to Portland streets. Along with them come the latest jobs in Portland's gig economy: charging, or ""juicing,"" as Lime calls it, the scooters with electricity. People like Ninh help ensure they are charged overnight and ready for people to ride the next morning. But the gig is not as lucrative as Silicon Valley moguls advertise it to be. I know. Because I tried it. Signing up to become a charger on the Bird, Lime and Skip apps is easy. After entering some personal information and reading through a few guidelines, interested parties are asked to fill out a W-9 and bank account information so they can get paid. I applied to be a Lime juicer, and my application was approved almost instantly. After picking up chargers from the Lime warehouse at Northeast 18th Avenue and Glisan Street, my Lime app updated to include both a rider version and juicer version. The juicer version shows the location of low-battery scooters. (The company allows only very near-death rides to be picked up before 9 pm.) Scooter companies want dead scooters in hard-to-reach locations to be charged and relocated someplace with more traffic. The bounty per scooter increases based on how difficult the scooter is to retrieve, how much charge is left in it, and how recently it was last ridden. In its July 17 Craigslist post, Lime purported that juicers could make ""$150 or more"" a night. In three nights of juicing, the most I made in one night was $14. That's in part because my car's so small—I could only fit two scooters at a time—but also due to the fact that the highest payout for a scooter I encountered was $7. Representatives for Bird and Lime declined to comment on how scooter-charging bounties were set, or how many juicers have signed up so far in Portland. Ninh says she's found scooter payouts of $6 to $7 to be common. But her car is bigger than mine, so she typically makes $50 a night. She also picks up Bird scooters exclusively. The Bird scooters, she says, are smaller and lighter than Lime scooters, meaning it's easier for her to pick up more. Ninh agrees charging has its pitfalls. Her frustrations include the difficulty of reaching Bird's customer service and, at times, having to drive to unsafe or obscure places to retrieve scooters. ""One of scariest experiences,"" she says, ""was while tracking down a Bird with a $12 or $15 payout. I was out past 9 pm, and [the app] told me it was behind a dumpster underneath the bridge."" It wasn't, so she booked out of there. Her dedication is admirable. She plans to keep charging as long as scooters are sanctioned in Portland. The city's pilot program lasts until Nov. 20, when transportation officials must decide whether to keep scooters on the streets. ""I told my fiance recently,"" Ninh says, ""we have four months to make as much money as we can on these."" My charging experience did not make me rich. In fact, I think I lost money on the gas I used to hunt the scooters and the electricity I used to charge them. The first night I juiced, I drove for 40 minutes before finding a scooter to pick up. The first one the app directed me to wasn't there, and the second and third were picked up by bargoers seconds before I could get to them. I ended up miles from my house, outside of White Owl Social Club in the Central Eastside, struggling to fit two heavy scooters into the back of my car at 10:30 pm on a Friday, muttering, ""Just here to pick up the scooters,"" to drunken passers-by. Finding a place in my small condo to charge two scooters was the next task, and to get the full payout, I had to have them back out on the street before 7 am the next day. All said, I made a whopping $10 that night, before expenses. Others are finding more success. Matt, another juicer who declined to give his full name, says on a good night, he rakes in $50—on a bad night $30. Matt tends bar on North Lombard Street and tracks down scooters late at night on his drive home. The later it gets, he's learned, the more the scooters are worth to charge. ""I find myself checking the apps from my couch every 30 minutes to track the payout trends,"" Matt says. He has rigged charging docks out of planks of wood and power outlet strips so he doesn't have to take scooters out of his car to charge at night. On a recent haul, Matt stopped at a Walgreens on Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. to take a Lime scooter for a joy ride in the parking lot before loading it into his car. ""There's something thrilling about it,"" he says about juicing. ""I'm not competitive—I wasn't an athlete as a kid—but there's a sport to it. I haven't figured it out yet.""

Since July 26, when 600 scooters were deployed in the city, Portland Bureau of Transportation counts 47,836 rides taken. With a 25 cent surcharge per ride, that means City Hall has made $11,595 on scooting Portlanders so far. That money goes toward overseeing the four-month scooter pilot program, which requires that companies operating here—Lime, Skip and Bird—share data with the city to determine if scooters are a viable long-term transit option.

An Instagram user in Venice Beach, Calif. created an account dedicated to scooter deaths—@birdgraveyard—where numerous posts show Birds and Limes in Davy Jones' Locker. So far, scooters have not begun piling up in the Willamette River. But an anonymous local watchdog has started a website, scootersintheriverpdx.com, to track scooter-tossing trends. The spartan site asks in bold, pixelated letters atop a lime green background, ""How many scooters have been thrown into the Willamette River?"" above the current count: 4.

Scooters Are Making People Mad—and They Might Spur the Next Breakthrough in Portland Transportation,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,8,21,"Scooters Are Making People Mad—and They Might Spur the Next Breakthrough in Portland Transportation. For advocates of active transportation, the whining about sidewalk scooting is a welcome sound. If Portland's new favorite pastime is riding scooters, complaining about people riding scooters is running a close second. In the nine days after electric scooters appeared on the city's streets, at least 122 people contacted City Hall to gripe. That's a rate of one complaint every two hours. The vast majority of grievances focused on people riding on sidewalks or not wearing helmets. ""I'm really disappointed that Portland decided to allow these toys on civic property,"" wrote a resident named Matthew Sanders on July 31. ""We have roads for cars, bike lanes for cycles, and sidewalks for pedestrian traffic. The last thing we need is another, fuzzy, class of transportation that doesn't fit within out current infrastructure plan."" But for advocates of active transportation, the whining about sidewalk scooting is a welcome sound. It puts pressure on city officials to accelerate their efforts to build a city where more people have ways to go car-free. ""Scooters highlight a weakness in the system,"" says Michael Andersen, senior fellow at the Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based urban planning nonprofit. ""To the extent that they're riding on sidewalks, there's inadequate bike infrastructure."" That's part of why bike activists have become combative scooter rooters: The enemy of cars is their friend. The demand for scooters—and the shortage of places to ride them—is creating a visual that spurs city officials to take a more aggressive approach to bike lanes and other places to ride safely. The scooter companies, which have been badly received in many cities where they've launched, are happy to have Portland's bike boosters as allies. ""Our objective as a company [is] getting people out of cars. To do that, you have to actually give them an alternative,"" says Lime's director of strategic initiatives, Gabriel Scheer. ""We are trying to create the alternative. Ideally, you do it in a way that's fun and that makes people's lives better."" Portland prides itself on being a city of cycles. But its efforts to offer alternatives to car commuting—and ease congestion and meet the city's landmark climate change goals—have stalled. In 1993, Portland pledged to reduce carbon emissions 40 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2030. To meet that goal, the city needs to cut in half the percentage of commuters driving by themselves to work. It wants half the county to go to work on bikes or public transit. Portland's not on pace to meet either of those goals. The percentage of commuters in cars hasn't meaningfully declined since 2010. Transit and bike commuters? Stuck at 19 percent. But scooters have been ardently received by Portlanders. Data show the number of rides increases each week, and most riders are using them for exactly the kind of short trips—2 miles or less—that urban planners want to pull people out of cars for. To be sure, scooters still account for a tiny fraction of trips in this city, and they may be cutting into bike ridership. The scooter pilot program isn't guaranteed to continue past November. But if they catch on, they would add a new mode of transportation that would help Portlanders shift from owning cars to renting multiple devices to get around. ""It gets more people used to buying rides when you need them, rather than buying vehicles and using them every once in a while,"" says Marc Schlossberg, co-director of the Sustainable Cities Initiative at the University of Oregon. ""The more we get into a situation where we buy a car ride when we need it, we buy a scooter ride when we need it, we use our own bike when we need it, I think that's a good future outcome."" If that happens, the result could be pressure on Portland officials to protect cyclists and scooter riders from cars—a goal bike activists have long desired. City officials running the scooter pilot program acknowledge new demand could spark new infrastructure. ""If e-scooter use continues to grow, scooter riders will likely ask for more neighborhood greenways, protected bike lanes and multiuse paths,"" says Dylan Rivera, spokesman for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. PBOT is currently weighing a plan for 23 miles of protected lanes and neighborhood greenways through the central city. Scooters could push the city to move faster. And they could help fund the projects. Santa Monica, Calif., the birthplace of the e-scooter craze, moved forward with an expansion of bike lanes and signals last month, thanks in part to funding expected to come from taxing scooters and bike share. In a less direct way, activists hope scooters could expedite Portland's aim for more bus and train service—by helping people get to public transportation. In a Lime company survey, 27 percent of users of both e-scooters and bike share in big cities reported they used Lime to get to public transportation on their last trip. The share of people using public transportation ""has been flat to down for years since the turn of the century,"" says Andersen. ""Scooters and bike shares and short hops solve the last-mile problem and increase potential ridership on core lines."" For believers, the scooters represent the first wave in a series of new technologies that could shift Portlanders away from cars and toward transportation that doesn't pollute—but also doesn't require too much exertion. Another one? E-bikes, which are bicycles with an electric motor. The city plans to introduce e-bikes as part of the next bike share contract in August 2019. Meanwhile, riders like Neil Heller are accepting the scooter backlash as a healthy conflict. The 40-year-old small-scale real estate developer was first in line for Lime scooters—he went to the company's warehouse days before it launched. In his dozen rides, he's had people yell at him out of their car windows and flash him a thumbs-down sign. He doesn't care. ""People are getting used to them,"" he says. ""But as soon as they try them, they'll be sold."" ",https://www.wweek.com/news/2018/08/21/scooters-are-making-people-mad-and-they-might-spur-the-next-breakthrough-in-transportation/

The meeting came a little more than halfway through a four-month pilot project approved this summer that paved the way for the scooters to hit the city. The pilot ends Nov. 20, and the three scooter companies will need to remove the thousands of devices as city transportation officials and politicians weigh what to do next. So far, scooter users have logged 578,768 miles as of last week, with an average trip of 1.2 miles Baker said she's tried to educate scooter riders that they can't ride on sidewalks and it's dangerous for slow walkers or people in wheelchairs or other mobility rides. She's only heard rude responses or profanities when she's tried to ask users to get off the sidewalk. ""They don't really give a darn about where they're putting them, and their attitudes are really horrible,"" Baker said. Others agreed. ""I also tell people to ride in the street, not the sidewalk,"" Matt Shaw, director of government relations for Bird scooters said at the meeting. ""And I get similar responses."" ""I don't like it either,"" he said of the rude responses. Briana Orr, the city staffer overseeing the scooter pilot program, said her office has heard concerns about safety on sidewalks. She pledged to do more monitoring in coming weeks to understand how or why users aren't parking their scooters correctly. The transit committee had previously called for ending the scooter trial because of the various concerns, but Tuesday's meeting turned into an education session of sorts, in which representatives from Bird, Skip and Lime scooter companies spoke about what they're trying to do to holder riders accountable. Shaw, the Bird representative, said the companies are all vying to give people another option other than driving a car by themselves, to reduce carbon emissions and hopefully ease congestion in cities. ""If we can't do that without creating other challenges, then we've failed in our mission,"" he said. All the company reps said they were considering new ways to crack down on scooter users who ride on sidewalks or park their devices inappropriately. All companies require the riders to take a picture of their parking job when finished riding. Muriel MacDonald, director of public affairs for Skip, said the picture exercise should ""immediately impact behavior"" for riders,"" but if it doesn't, the company can send warnings for repeat offenders and ultimately ban bad actors. She joked that the company's enforcement is ""more robust than the DMV."" MacDonald and the other company officials said scooter developers are looking at ways to track when riders are on sidewalks and slow down the devices as one alternative to shift behavior. Claudia Robertson, a TriMet committee members, said that while she's concerned about a lack of enforcement, she - and others - shouldn't hold out hope for it. The city is already hard-pressed to enforce the 20-mph residential speed limit, Robertson said. People, including the elderly and those with disabilities, will have to be on guard, and scooter users will need to follow the rules. ""Somehow,"" she said, ""personal responsibility is going to have to be part of that message."" ",https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2018/10/theres_no_respect_trimet_disab.html
Why Can People Who Can’t Legally Get Driver’s Licenses Ride E-Scooters?,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,10,24,"Why Can People Who Can’t Legally Get Driver’s Licenses Ride E-Scooters?

Today I learned of a young man who is legally blind and therefore can't get a driver's license, but guess what—he can ride an electric scooter! Who wants to be the next unlucky schmuck who happens to be ambulating in his direction? Help! —Harriet M. One of the less well-documented side effects of income inequality is the proliferation of people who have become staggeringly wealthy without ever having done anything particularly useful or clever. Such people are called ""venture capitalists,"" and I suppose it's not surprising that, given their life experience, they've come to believe the road to riches is paved with useless, stupid shit. Do I really need to explain why we're having this conversation in the context of electric scooters? I'm not claiming to have any inside information, but it certainly appears that the companies who've been clogging our streets with these scooters are pursuing the time-honored Silicon Valley business model of ""lose money every day and sell the company to Google before anybody realizes what a stupid idea it is."" Let's do the math: A Xiaomi scooter (the kind used by scooter company Bird) retails for $599. Bird's boosters will no doubt point to economies of scale, but Bird also has to trick out each scooter with GPS and a payment system. Call it $500 all told. You can rent a scooter for $1, plus 15 cents a mile. They have a range of around 18 miles on a charge. The companies pay contractors about $7 to recharge spent scooters overnight. This means that if I embrace the scooter tao and use one for my daily commute (9 miles each way), the scooter folks will lose $2.30 a day on me, allowing them to recover their $500 investment approximately never. ""Hey, we lose money on each transaction, but we make it up in volume!"" There's also the awkward fact someone in the U.S. dies on one of these scooters about once a month. While that's peanuts compared to cars' body count, I can't help noting that a new designer drug with this safety record would have already been banned by a Senate vote of 99-1. (Thanks, Bernie.)

"Scooters struggle in rain, Skip pulls fleet offline",KOIN,CBS,"Portland, OR",2018,10,25,"Scooters struggle in rain, Skip pulls fleet offline. Slick streets, umbrellas and abandoned e-scooters — all signs that the season has changed. Devin Goulet usually rides a scooter every day — but not anymore. “I was kind of bummed,” he said. “I was actually looking forward to it. That is like my favorite part of the day, is riding a scooter home.” He’s never used one in the rain, but had taken one for a spin while the roads were still wet. “You can definitely kind of feel it takes a minute,” he said. “I try to sit back and slowly ease into it. I would never squeeze it immediately because you would go sliding for sure.” Some chose to take the risk in the rain. “It is a great way to commute,” Jamie McDermott said. “I’ve been told don’t turn at a 90-degree angle, because they tend to plow, so I’m trying to keep the sharpness of the turns down.” While some scooters remain on the road, you’ll have to wait until the rain dries up to ride a Skip. The entire fleet is offline until conditions dry up. Skip spokesperson told KOIN 6 News the current fleet is made for warm weather and are only water resistant. “We are responsive to weather and conditions. As a consideration to the community, while the rains are super heavy, we will be pulling our fleet of Skip scooters from the streets of Portland. Because while Portland knows rain, and Skip is prepared for rain, we are looking at the big picture as to what’s in the communities’ and our best interest. We’d rather be more cautious than less, to ensure every rider as the best experience with Skip.” Some Birds are not flying in these conditions, but the company recently debuted a new rugged scooter, which is designed for a better ride. Bird provided the following statement about safety: “Bird is extremely committed to the safety of our riders. We take into account the weather conditions of each city where Bird is available and adjust our operations accordingly so that riders can safely access our service. We recently unveiled Bird Zero – the industry’s first rugged e-scooter designed by Bird specifically for Rideshare 2.0. This new e-scooter, which has been rolling out to cities across the U.S., will provide a more reliable and stable ride across a variety of ground surfaces.” “No one really knows how they fair in winter,” Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesperson Dylan Rivera said. “For the next month we will really have a test of electric scooters and how viable they are in Portland.” There have been half a million rides in Portland during the 4-month trial period and PBOT said safety is always the priority. “Be aware that manhole covers, wet compacted leaves can all provide slick surfaces that can be tricky for anyone to navigate,” River said.

As a consideration to the community, because of the rain, they've pulled their fleet from the streets of Portland."" Florez says there's no immediate plans to re-deploy scooters, and that the company will continue to ""be responsive to weather.""

"E-scooters end this week, but may stick around through holiday",KGW,NBC,"Portland, OR",2018,11,14,"E-scooters end this week, but may stick around through holiday. All 2,000 scooters will be taken off Portland streets after the program ends on Tuesday, Nov. 20. Despite appeals from the scooter companies, Portland's experiment with electric scooters will come to an end on Tuesday, as was announced earlier in November. Portland Bureau of Transportation officials said that the scooters may still be visible around Portland for up to a week more though because of the Thanksgiving holiday and the time required for the various companies to collect them. During that time, the scooters will not be able to be rented so the ride apps should not work after Tuesday, city officials said. More than 2,000 scooters will be taken off the streets, ending the four-month-long pilot program. The program began back in July. According to numbers from the Portland Bureau of Transportation, there have been more than 643,000 trips taken and 745,000 miles ridden. The average trip length is about 1.2 miles. Three scooter companies participated in the pilot program: Skip, Bird and Lime. Under the pilot program, the scooter companies were asked to place 50 percent of their fleet in east Portland, but at least one of the companies wasn't following that rule -- and was fined. Skip now owes the city $9,000. And if you've been enjoying the scooters, don't worry! They may not be gone forever. In early 2019, the city will share findings from the program and get input from the community about the future of scooters in Portland.

Portland’s E-Scooter Pilot Program Ends Tuesday. What Happens Now?,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2018,11,18,"Portland’s E-Scooter Pilot Program Ends Tuesday. What Happens Now? Bird, Lime and Skip are making pleas to the city to keep e-scooters around. Portland is Scooterville no more. After four months, the city's electric scooter pilot program has come to an end. The provisional program was launched in July as a way to test out scooters while avoiding the fates of cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, where scooter rental startups launched without permission, wreaked havoc and were eventually banned. (Scoots have since returned to San Francisco, but under stricter permits with rules similar to Portland's.) With only one pending legal complaint currently filed, by a Portland Uber driver who says two people on one Skip scooter wrecked his car, Portland's program appears to have been semi-successful in avoiding chaos and costly lawsuits. Still, the long-term fate of the motorized machines in Portland is unclear. ""We have not made any decisions about whether shared e-scooters have a long-term future in Portland,"" Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesman Dylan Rivera says. ""We are currently focusing our efforts on understanding the data and feedback we compiled during the pilot."" So before you try e-scooting to work next week, here's what to know about the end of the pilot program. When will the scooters go away? All scooters are required to be taken offline by Wednesday, Nov. 21. But Rivera says it's unlikely scooters will disappear overnight. ""Companies have said it may take them up to a week to remove their equipment from the public right-of-way due to the holiday,"" he says. ""Anyone who sees a shared e-scooter on public right of way is encouraged to report it to the company."" Will scooter operators actually follow the rules and remove the machines? Probably, but begrudgingly. They've been begging City Hall for an extension—and they're still working the refs with days to go. Jeremy Nelson, general manager for Lime in Oregon, says: ""We fully support Portland's evaluation of the pilot. However, we think the best approach would be to extend the pilot period and evaluate it at the same time."" Matt Whiffen, regional general manager for Skip, says the company will be a ""cooperative partner"" in agreeing to pause the program. He adds that, despite gaffes like having to pull scooters from the street in the rain, he expects data will ""support a long-term program."" ""It is always challenging to fully ramp an operation during a short term pilot,"" Whiffen says. ""With that said, we look forward to working with PBOT and the City of Portland to develop a long-term program that facilitates scooters as a reliable, permanent alternative to cars."" E-scooter company Bird is basing its plea to the city to extend the program on job and revenue creation. In a letter sent to Commissioner Chloe Eudaly on Nov. 2, the company's senior manager, Marlo Sandler, touts the employment of over 700 Portlanders working as contracted e-scooter chargers. Those chargers, Sandler says, have collectively earned around $413,000. ""To date,"" Sandler adds, ""Bird has put aside more than $46,000 in funds for the city as part of our Save Our Sidewalks pledge. This money, we've earmarked to help with further investment in safe streets infrastructure, education and other related programs."" When will the scooters be back? It's too soon to say when or if scooters will return to Portland. Rivera says PBOT plans to release pilot program findings to the public in early 2019. That suggests that, if the city keeps to its planned timeline, scooters won't return until next year. Who decides the city's next scooter policy? PBOT pledges the old Portland standby: a public process. ""We plan to share our findings with the public and seek more public input,"" says Rivera. Commissioner Chloe Eudaly oversees PBOT, and transportation commissioners typically take a hands-on interest in policy decisions of this scale. What complaint could keep scooters from returning? Rivera says it's people riding on the sidewalk. ""There are a variety of factors that PBOT and the community will need to consider for us to determine the long-term future of this new technology,"" he says. ""More respectful riding by e-scooter users, riding in the street or bicycle lane rather than the sidewalk, and no riding in public parks would improve how the general public perceives this new transportation option."" How much did the city make on the pilot program? ""We are collecting a 25 cent surcharge on all shared e-scooter rides in the city limits,"" Rivera says. ""We won't have final figures until early 2019."" A rough calculation—based on the city's most recent report of 676,034 total scooter trips and the $9,000 penalty recently levied to Skip—shows the city would have made upwards of $178,008.

In Fact, They Might Have Helped. Data show Biketown ridership numbers increased during the four month scooter pilot program. Some people hated them. Some people loved them. But the brief festival of electric scooters in Portland did reignite interest in alternative forms of transit—including Biketown, the city's bike-share program. Any fears that e-scooters would eat into business were unfounded. New data provided by Portland Bureau of Transportation show that ridership numbers for Biketown have been steadily increasing since the start of the city's four-month long scooter pilot program. According to PBOT's data, Portlanders took 133,625 Biketown trips between July 26 and November 20, the same period of time that scooters were on city streets. That's a six percent increase from the same period in 2017. The scooter program ended Nov. 20, and PBOT is now reviewing data and preparing for a public process to determine if the new machines will come back. But the popularity of e-scooters—nearly 700,000 rides were taken in four months—in combination with the increased use of bike share paint an encouraging picture of a less car-dependent city. The scooter rental numbers are five times the number of bike rentals. That said, Biketown's fleet is also half the size of the scooters deployed by three companies combined. There were a total of 2,049 scooters operating in Portland, while only 1,000 Biketown bikes are in use. Biketown's week-by-week data show that there were only five weeks during the scooter pilot program when bike share ridership decreased from the same weeks in 2017. Most weeks, bike share rides increased—sometimes by more than double. During one week in October, Biketown ridership increased by 72 percent, or over 2,000 rides.

Early financial records provided to WW by the Portland Bureau of Transportation reveal that during the four month e-scooter pilot program, the city grossed $188,245.25 from operators Bird, Lime and Skip in application fees, permits, use fees and penalties. As a stipulation of the program, companies were required to pay a 25 cent surcharge on every e-scooter ride taken. PBOT reports residents took 676,034 total rides in four months. Other rules said that operators must make 90 percent of fleets available and that they must deploy scooters to East Portland. (Skip was fined $9,000 for violating that requirement.) The city spent money monitoring the scooter pilot. During the four months of the experiment, PBOT also reports spending $86,420.86 on administration, enforcement and evaluation fees. The agency is still determining whether or not to invite scooters to operate full-time in Portland. Initial data on the pilot program is scheduled to be released next year.

"E-scooters will return to Portland this spring, transportation officials say",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,1,15,"E-scooters will return to Portland this spring, transportation officials say. Portland took electric scooters for a whirl last year, and city transportation officials apparently largely liked what they saw. Nearly three months after Lime, Skip and Bird scooters were whisked away from Portland streets after a four-month trial period, the city is recommending the transportation companies be allowed to return this spring. A final date hasn’t been released. Portland said the scooters will be permitted for one year. The recommendation came in a 36-page report released by the city transportation bureau Tuesday. Before the four-month trial began, Portland pledged to evaluate the scooters based on whether the devices reduced congestion and reliance on private cars and trucks, how the companies addressed safety concerns, if they served low-income communities and if the scooters helped reduced air pollution. The report says, while the city needs more data, scooters “have the potential to advance Portland’s transportation goals,"" like reducing car trips and give people a safe and reliable way to get around. But transportation leaders still have concerns about equity -- the companies “did not consistently comply” with regulations requiring scooters be deployed in east Portland. They also were concerned about “illegal sidewalk riding” and other safety issues. “Scooters are appropriate for bike lanes or low-volume streets, but they are too fast for use on sidewalks, where they make it unsafe or uncomfortable for people walking or using mobility devices,” the report said. “And while staff observations showed most scooters parked properly in the sidewalk furnishing zone, improperly parked scooters negatively impacted accessibility and created a hazard for people with visual impairments.” And while scooter riders frequently ditched cars to take the rentable transit devices, the city doesn’t know how many car trips were added by so-called “juicers” who are paid by the scooter companies to retrieve and recharge the devices' batteries every night. That business structure “likely added personal motor vehicle trips to the transportation system,” the report states, but “the extent and overall impact to the transportation system and traffic congestion is unknown.” According to stats provided to the city under a condition of the permit, users logged more than 801,000 miles on scooters during the trial run. The average length of a trip was 1.2 miles, and the city’s supply hovered near 2,000 devices on the streets for much of the period. In July, Portland became one of dozens of cities around the world to discover the everyday joy or everyday annoyances, depending on one’s perspective, encapsulated by the e-scooter trend. The companies seemingly arrived out of a futuristic tech fantasy world in city centers across America and ultimately the world in 2018. In some cities the scooters were unregulated; in others the companies opened shop without city consent, and tales grew of stockpiles of trashed scooters chucked into trees, into waterways and strewn across city sidewalks. In an attempt to prevent some of those issues, Portland set strict regulations, which included a 25-cent surcharge for every ride logged. Portland required the companies deploy scooters, or 20 percent of any their total fleet (whichever is less), in areas of east or far Northeast neighborhoods. Portland capped the number of scooters at 2,500, but the actual figure hovered close to 2,000 for the four-month period. “I’m glad that PBOT took a proactive approach, requiring e-scooter companies to share their data and to serve East Portland,” Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said in a statement. ""While this technology has the potential to reduce congestion and pollution, I remain concerned about the unlawful use of e-scooters on sidewalks and in City parks, and the impact of e-scooters on people with mobility challenges or vision impairment. We will continue to seek public input on how to best serve all Portlanders.” Jeremy Nelson, general manager for Lime in Oregon, said the city’s report “affirms” the company’s experience in Portland. “Scooters helped shift commuters’ behavior, replacing large numbers of car trips, enabling them to move more freely around their city, and lessening congestion and pollution in the meantime,” he said in an email. Lime plans to return to the city “as soon as we are allowed to do so,"" he said. In October, a city survey of 4,500 scooter riders found broad support from riders for the newfangled transit trend. Respondents seemed to love the devices, with 59 percent calling for more scooters to hit city streets. Users tended to know the law – that helmets were required and sidewalk use was prohibited – but chose to flout the helmet aspect. The majority of riders, 57 percent, said they rode in bike lanes half of the time. Bike lanes were the preferred mode to get around, though. Some 19 percent of users said they would have taken a car instead of a scooter, but most said they chose scooters because they were fun. A followup survey of riders found scooter riders almost never rode on sidewalks when there were bike lanes or low-stress neighborhood greenways available. If no bike lanes existed, 39 percent of users said they rode on the sidewalk. According to data compiled by the Multnomah County Health Department, scooter injuries accounted for about 5 percent of the 3,220 traffic-related emergency room visits during the four months they were on city streets. There were 176 scooter-related trips to the ER between July 23 and Nov. 20, while 429 cyclists went to the hospital during that same time period. Jae Douglas, the county’s environmental health director, said scooters have “risks similar” to other transportation options. “We did not find a disproportionate risk that would discourage the city from allowing a scooter ride-share pilot,"" Douglas said in a statement. The vast majority of those ER visits, 83 percent, occurred when a scooter rider just fell on their own. Just 22 crashes involved a car and a scooter rider, according to the data. It’s unclear whether the majority of riders were wearing helmets in the documented crashes, but 16 percent of riders showed “evidence of intoxication.” According to an additional city poll conducted in December, 34 percent of Portland scooter riders rented the device in lieu of driving or taking an Uber or Lyft or taxi, while 48 percent of tourists did so. The city said it would conduct an “online open house” next month on the scooter issue and will meet with transit safety and advocacy committees to discuss how to structure the one-year pilot program. Other interesting data points from the report: - 5,885: Average number of trips each day - 75 percent: Of people of color polled said they viewed scooters positively, but some focus group participants said they were concerned about traffic safety and “being targeted for racial profiling” - 145 square miles: The city’s service area - 42 percent: Of those polled said they never ride a bike - 74 percent: Said they never ride the city’s Biketown rental service - 1,622: Number of illegal sidewalk riding reports submitted to PBOT’s complaint website, representing 26.9 percent of all complaints - 700,369: Total trips - 19 percent: Of trips occurred between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays - 90 percent: Of riders observed by PBOT staff were not wearing helmets ",https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2019/01/e-scooters-will-return-to-portland-this-spring-transportation-officials-say.html
Should e-scooter riders be required to wear helmets? Politicians to hold hearing,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,2,11,"Should e-scooter riders be required to wear helmets? Politicians to hold hearing. A bill to make helmets optional for electric scooter riders will have a public hearing in Salem this week. The bill, introduced by Rep. Sheri Schouten, D-Beaverton, goes before the Joint Committee on Transportation at 5 p.m. Wednesday. Oregon’s current law requires all electric or gas scooter users wear helmets, regardless of age. Scooters are regulated more stringently than Segways, which have no helmet requirement. State rules require bicyclists under the age of 16 to wear a helmet. Schouten’s bill, HB271, would regulate scooters like bikes. Scooter riders would only be required to wear a helmet if under the age of 16. But in effect, the bill would make helmets optional for all scooter riders. State rules require scooter users to be at least 16 years old to ride, but the companies required customers be at least 18 to sign up. But it wasn’t an uncommon sight in 2018 to see younger teens on the devices around Portland. The legislation could effectively knee-cap the biggest complaint scooter detractors made to city hall last year. According to the Bureau of Transportation’s report on the 2018 three-month trial period, the city received 1,754 companies about riders not using helmets. That’s the largest single point of scorn, followed next by users riding on sidewalks, with 1,622 complaints. Transportation Department staff estimated that 90 percent of riders did not wear a helmet. Lime, Bird and Skip, the three companies that operated in Portland in 2018, held helmet giveaways during the trial period to try and boost usage. According to the city’s report, the companies distributed 2,292 helmets to riders last year. Dylan Rivera, a city transportation spokesman, said the agency would not take a position on the proposed helmet bill. “We certainly encourage everyone to wear a helmet when riding a bicycle, an e-bike or an e-scooter. So that might be a reason to support the current law,” Rivera said in an email. “On the other hand, we can understand how there could be value in having consistency between the laws for bicycles and e-scooters,” Rivera continued. “Our citywide public opinion survey showed that Portlanders want us to use education rather than enforcement when it comes to e-scooters. And we generally agree that it’s best to focus our limited enforcement resources on corridors where we have fatal and serious injury crashes,” he said. The city plans to start a second “pilot program” sometime this spring, this time approving scooters for 12 months. A specific start date has not been released.

"E-Scooters Return To Portland Despite Concern Over Accessibility, Inclusivity",Oregon Public Broadcasting,NPR,"Portland, OR",2019,3,24,"E-Scooters Return To Portland Despite Concern Over Accessibility, Inclusivity. Portland is using new strategies in its second electric scooter pilot program to increase safety, inclusivity and accessibility, but some people are still worried about oversight. Even on a gray, damp day, Cory Huff is still happy to rent an electric scooter. Huff and his wife gave up on owning a car 12 years ago when they got tired of the upkeep and maintenance. Instead, he’s been focused on alternative forms of getting around such as Car2Go, public transportation and biking. “I probably think about transportation more than most people because I don’t have a car,” Huff said. “I’m always thinking what is the most optimal way to get where I’m going because it’s not just about cost, it’s also about how fast will I get there, how safe will it be and how fun will it be.” Huff is a digital marketing consultant and business owner. He works from home, but rides e-scooters about five or six times a week to run errands and go to meetings. He was one of the people who accounted for some of the more than 700,000 rides that Portlanders took on electric scooters last year during the city’s four-month e-scooter pilot program. Now, e-scooters have returned for a full year, but not everyone in Portland is as excited as Huff. Last year, the city’s pilot aimed to bridge gaps in transportation and get more people out of their vehicles, and for the most part, it did do that. A report from the Portland Bureau of Transportation, or PBOT, the agency in charge of the e-scooter program, found that for many people last year, e-scooters were an introduction to active transportation. The program also encouraged a good chunk of people to use e-scooters instead of cars. About 34% of Portlanders and 48% of visitors took an e-scooter instead of driving or using a ride-share program, the report states. But still, there are a multitude of concerns around accessibility, safety and inclusivity when it comes to scooters in Portland. “We’ve received quite a lot of complaints from people with disabilities within Portland mainly revolving around sidewalk access with e-scooters either by blocking part of the sidewalk, by being parked sideways or by being parked right on curb ramps,” said Matthew Denney, an attorney with the nonprofit legal group Disability Rights Oregon. Although people can technically park e-scooters on the sidewalk, they must be near a bike rack or close to the curb, so as to not block access. E-scooter users illegally riding on sidewalks was also an issue last year. Dylan Rivera is with PBOT. He said they’ve been keeping those issues in mind when talking with Disability Rights Oregon about this new pilot program. Specifically, while the old program focused solely on education, the new one allows for penalties to be issued against riders. “We’ll have PBOT regulatory specialists monitoring sidewalks especially for illegal scooter riding and parking and providing that information to the companies,” Rivera said. From there, the companies — not PBOT — will issue warnings, fines and suspensions. Disability Rights Oregon is concerned about that. Rivera said PBOT will analyze the data, including the number of rides taken, injuries and complaints. Just like a report they put out last year, that data will be public, he said. Still, with three different, private scooter companies being held accountable for the data, Denney said he worries that negative information, like complaints, could easily be withheld, and fines and warnings may not be issued. “We’re concerned that this is a way for the companies to kind of self-police and that it’s going to result in actually less information coming out of this pilot than last pilot,” Denney said. Jeremy Nelson is Oregon’s general manager for Lime, one of the companies in both the current and former e-scooter pilot programs. Nelson said the company has incentive to take action against problematic riders. “We don’t want these folks who repeatedly are causing problems to be on our scooters,” he said. “We actually welcome the opportunity to understand when someone is doing something wrong and we actually want to educate those riders.” The new complaint process is another concern for Disability Rights Oregon. Last year, people could send general complaints directly to PBOT. This led to the agency receiving more than 6,000 complaints about scooters and riders from Portlanders, most of them related to riders not wearing helmets or riding on sidewalks. This year, the complaint process must go through each individual scooter company — and the complaint must identify a specific rider. A major issue in this for Denney is that people must record a “permit number” from the front of the scooter in order to make a complaint. “If you don’t know the number of the scooter because it went by you on the sidewalk or you didn’t get it when you walked by it, there’s not actually a way to send a complaint into the company,” he said. “I think that’s going to discourage a lot of people from even sending in complaints.” Nelson with Lime said that number on the front of the scooters is the only way to hold individual riders accountable. “Without that, there are hundreds of thousands of trips taken, and it would be like saying, ‘A red car was going too fast,’” he said. “But if you can say, ‘A red car with a certain license plate number,’ which essentially is what the permit number on the front of the scooter acts as, then we’re able to identify an individual.” Nelson said that Lime has “suspended several riders whose behavior was extremely negative” so far, after receiving all of the information needed to identify the people, including the permit number. Related: Data Show Women Ride Portland E-Scooters Less Than Men Along with ongoing uncertainty from Portlanders with disabilities, there have also been concerns surrounding accessibility and inclusivity with the e-scooters. The first pilot worked successfully on extending ridership outward from Portland’s core — to North Portland and East Portland — in a push to include people of color and low-income Portlanders. Nelson with Lime said the company is trying to make scooters accessible by offering discounts for underserved communities with Lime Access — a program that gives a 50% discount to riders on local or federal assistance programs. According to Portland State University researcher Jennifer Dill, data from last year's program shows that ridership with respect to race and income was relatively balanced. She found the biggest gap in ridership is with gender. Dill found that only about a third of Portland e-scooter riders last year were women. The issue was safety, she said. “Women want safer, more separated infrastructure,” Dill said. “A white-striped bike lane is not enough to make a lot of women feel safe biking on the street and the same thing goes for e-scooters.” Rivera with PBOT said, even though there’s a need for more data collection, he agrees. “Our strong suspicion is that as we grow our network of protected bike lanes, we’ll see more women riding bicycles and potentially more women riding e-scooters,” he said. Rivera said that a portion of the money from all e-scooter rides will go toward improving bike infrastructure. Although there are only about 1,000 e-scooters on Portland streets currently, by early 2020, Rivera says there will probably be 8,000 or 9,000.

"E-scooters may return April 26, Portland says, with new regulations geared to curb sidewalk riding",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,3,25,"E-scooters may return April 26, Portland says, with new regulations geared to curb sidewalk riding. Depending on your viewpoint, it’s time to celebrate or shake your fists to the sky: Electric scooters may return to Portland streets as soon as April 26, transportation officials said. The Portland Bureau of Transportation announced Monday that it would accept applications for a one-year permit, and the companies will face a new set of regulations geared toward eliminating illegal sidewalk riding and preventing users from jamming up Tom McCall Waterfront Park. Dylan Rivera, a transportation spokesman, said the companies would have until April 9 to apply for a permit, and they would then potentially be approved to hit the streets by April 26. “Some of the companies may not be quite ready to start that soon,” Rivera said, “But they are capable of applying, and they are in fact eager to,” he added. Portland believes the new rules offer a little bit for everyone. Those who clamored for more scooters on the streets may get that wish if the companies follow the city’s blueprint. People who said the city didn’t do enough to stop people from riding on sidewalks and endangering or inconveniencing people with disabilities or other pedestrians will see users suspended or fined for violating that law. Companies will face different requirements to legally operate in the city than those that Bird, Skip and Lime faced during a four-month trial period that ended Nov. 20. It’s unclear if the companies will find the new regulations acceptable, but in November, three companies urged the city not to pull the plug on the first trial -- citing the overwhelming success experienced in Portland. The changes are substanial. Portland said companies that can offer accessible seated scooters as part of their fleet and/or the ability to lock the devices to public bike racks could score better in the next application process. Transportation officials will charge the companies a one-time daily “Right of Way Fee” for every scooter, with a 5 cent charge if a ride ends in east Portland or 20 cents for parking at any time up in the Central City (meaning broadly the downtown, Pearl District, South Waterfront, Central Eastside or Lloyd District neighborhoods). Anywhere else, scooters will face a 10-cent one-time charge. If there are multiple trips, the city would charge companies the higher geographical rate. “Their growth in Portland will be directly tied to their ability to reduce carbon emissions, serve underserved communities and preserve sidewalk access for people with disabilities,” Rivera said of the program. The city will start with allowing the same number of scooters — 2,500 — as it did in 2018. But the new rules will put pressure on the companies to penalize scooter riders who illegally ride on sidewalks by warning them through the smartphone application, issuing fines or banning them from using the devices altogether. Rivera said companies must also provide a “geofence” around Waterfront Park and the riverfront multi-use path to prevent riders from parking the devices there. But the geofence won’t prevent people from riding through the park or on Willamette River bridges altogether. “The companies are concerned that making e-scooters suddenly slow down or stop at the entrance to a park could pose a safety hazard,” Rivera said in an email. “We are requiring the companies to participate in local testing of geofenced areas that restrict speed.” Companies will also have to let riders know they are entering a “no ride” zone, but how the companies will do that remains unclear. If the companies meet those and other requirements, they will be allowed to add more scooters periodically. Rivera said that if all companies achieve all of their incentives outlined in the new administrative rules, there could be as many as 15,000 scooters on Portland streets by January. Rivera said it’s unlikely the maximum figure will materialize. City officials believe 9,000 is a more realistic and achievable figure. “Getting riders to obey rules is critical to the success of this,” he said in an interview. Other incentives include drawing high ridership in east Portland and achieving various benchmarks for number of rides per scooter, the city said. Sidewalk enforcement is going to be a chief focus of the next permit application. Disability rights advocates had criticized the city and the companies for not doing enough during the 2018 trial period to penalize users who rode on sidewalks. The companies will be required to charge users 25 cents per ride and to explain through the application that the surcharge will go toward bike lane infrastructure and other transportation expenses. Rivera said that is so scooter riders “understand that they are part of the transportation system.” According to Rivera, the scooter pilot program in 2018 cost the city $75,205 to operate. Permit costs to the companies and the 25-cent surcharge per ride brought in $212,077, but the city spent $287,282. He said the cost of the final report, focus groups on the scooters’ popularity and public opinion surveys drove the excess spending. The scooter users logged more than 801,000 miles during the trial run, with an average trip length of 1.2 miles and a supply of roughly 2,000 devices on the streets for much of the period. Bird, one of the three companies, had pledged to give all cities it operated in $1 per scooter per day to help build protected bike lanes. Rivera said the city has not received any funding from the companies “beyond the fees and surcharges we required them to pay.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2019/03/e-scooters-may-return-april-26-portland-says-with-potentially-6-times-as-many-devices-allowed.html
"E-scooters will return to Portland with new rules, enforcement fines, more scooters",Katu,ABC,"Portland, OR",2019,3,25,"E-scooters will return to Portland with new rules, enforcement fines, more scooters. The sharable e-scooters are coming back to Portland and could be back on the streets as soon as April 26, but the city’s transportation bureau said Monday that there will be some changes to how safety rules are enforced. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) took input from thousands of Portlanders after a pilot program last summer, which factored in the new public safety measures as they roll out a second, full-year trial dubbed the “Shared Electric Scooter Pilot Program.” The new trial will last from April 26, 2019 and run through April 26, 2020. As many as 2,500 scooters could be on the streets at the beginning of the pilot. PBOT says some of the biggest concerns among Portlanders were related to people riding on the sidewalk, or parking scooters illegally. In the new pilot, riders could be fined $50 for riding on the sidewalk and $15 for parking the scooters illegally. Dylan Rivera, a PBOT spokesperson, said PBOT will monitor high-traffic areas and notify the scooter companies of riders breaking the rules. He says scooter companies will issue warnings, fines, and could suspend riders' accounts. ""We want to preserve access to the sidewalks for everyone,"" Rivera said. More than 1,600 complaints were filed last year regarding people riding scooters on the sidewalk, according to PBOT's 2018 E-Scooter Findings Report. That represents more than 26 percent of all complaints. The group, Disability Rights Oregon, had several concerns it brought to the transportation bureau regarding safety. It said e-scooters can be hazardous to the disabled community. Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said the city heard those concerns. PBOT is encouraging companies to use scooters that can attach to bike locks, which would keep them out of the way of pedestrians and off ADA ramps. The city will also be adding on a 25-cent use fee, and the companies will be charged between 5 and 20 cents for a “right-of-way” fee. All the money generated will go toward making more areas for e-scooters to safely ride. Companies also must use geofencing technology to prevent riders from leaving scooters in city parks, like along the walkway in Tom McCall Waterfront Park. Rivera says the city expects up to 2,500 scooters on the streets when the pilot project begins. Companies can incrementally expand their “fleets” moving forward. Rivera says there could be as many as 9,000 scooters on Portland streets by January if companies follow all the city’s regulations and help PBOT meet its goals, like stopping people from riding on the sidewalk, stopping improper parking, and getting better ridership in east Portland. ""One of the things we heard was folks wanted more scooters, because they couldn't find one when they wanted one,"" Rivera said. ""Even with about 700,000 rides in four months last year, there could have been more rides if they were more available."" Those rides totaled more than 800,000 miles. A spokesperson for Bird, one of the scooter companies in Portland during the 2018 pilot, sent the following statement to KATU News. ""Bird was proud to have partnered with Portland to serve its residents under the city's first shared e-scooter pilot program. While we are still reviewing the new rules provided by PBOT, our hope is that we can return to Portland's streets and once again offer our low-cost, environmentally friendly alternative to short car trips."" Jonathan Hopkins, who works in Government Affairs for Lime, one of the other companies in Portland last year, said they are also looking at the applications provided by PBOT. He said their biggest concern is the high fees being charged by PBOT, which he says are higher than most other cities they work in.

E-scooters are back on Portland streets: 5 things you need to know,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,4,26,"E-scooters are back on Portland streets: 5 things you need to know. By the time you read this, electric scooters will be back on the block. At some point Friday, you should be able to rent a dockless e-scooter somewhere in Portland. Depending on your point of view, this is either terrific or terrible news. Here are five things you should know. 1) Scooters are fun: Beyond the hullaballoo about e-scooters as an annoyance to some, there is an inherent truth: they are fun to ride. The Oregonian/OregonLive took a scooter for a spin in 2018 when they were in town for the first four-month trial run, and we summarized the experience here. Basically be safe, have fun, stay off the sidewalks, and use common sense. 2) Sidewalks and parks: We’ll say it again – please stay off the sidewalks. It is illegal to ride on sidewalks with a scooter, and the city said it would ramp up enforcement and lean on the companies to warn riders if they are riding illegally and institute fines or ban riders altogether if they violate those rules. The companies are also expected to create “geo-fences” to keep riders from terminating their rides in Tom McCall Waterfront Park. 3) Helmets: Helmets are still required for all users, despite some effort in Salem to address that, but don’t expect rigid enforcement of those rules. Sidewalk riders are the top priority. 4) How many: City officials say they expect as many as 2,500 scooters from the outset, virtually the same number as last year. But Portland said it would incentivize companies to grow their fleets over time. Ultimately there could be as many as 15,000 by January, but Portland said 9,000 is a more realistic number. 5) Which companies: Portland on Friday morning announced that Lime, Bolt and Spin were awarded permits to operate in town. Four more companies -- Clevr Mobility, Jump, Razor USA, Shared Technologies, Inc. -- are in “the final stages” of providing necessary information for a permit. If they meet city standards, PBOT said Friday those companies may deploy their fleets “in the coming weeks.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2019/04/e-scooters-are-back-on-portland-streets-5-things-you-need-to-know.html
They're back: E-scooters once again on Portland city streets,KGW,NBC,"Portland, OR",2019,4,26,"They're back: E-scooters once again on Portland city streets. The dockless electric scooter vehicles are back as of April 26 for a one-year pilot program. Lime, Bolt and Spin have been authorized. A year-long program will bring 2,500 e-scooters to Portland streets starting Friday, according to the Portland Bureau of Transportation. But there are changes to how and where they can be used. This comes after a 4-month pilot program last year that brought just over 2,000 e-scooters to city streets, and clocked in more than 700,000 trips averaging 1.15 miles each. PBOT says last year's 120-day pilot program showed e-scooters can help reduce congestion and pollution. But on the flip side, there are concerns about riding them on sidewalks, which is a violation of state law, and parking them irresponsibly. Portlanders have mixed opinions about the scooters; some expressing excitement, others explaining their concerns. Under the new year-long program, as many as 9,000 scooters could roll out by January 2020 if companies qualify for incentives, according to PBOT. Bolt, Lime and Spin have initially been authorized to have scooters available, while four other companies - Clevr Mobility, Jump, Razor USA and Shared Technologies Inc. - are in the final stages of the permit process and will have their scooters on hand within weeks, city officials said. New measures will be set in motion, intended to improve public safety, ensure service to East Portland and generate money for safety improvements. PBOT is requiring companies to issue notifications, warnings, fines and account suspensions to people not using them legally. The transportation bureau says they will regulate and monitor illegal riding, and send that information off to the e-scooter companies, as well as audit and monitor companies’ incentives and penalties. Riders will be charged a 25-cent street-use fee and companies will be charged a a 5 to 20-cent right-of-way fee to generate money to build safe places for e-scooters, such as protected bike lanes and greenways. Scooter riders could be fined $50 for riding on sidewalks and $15 for illegally parking, after an initial warning from PBOT regulatory specialists. Portlanders took more than 700,000 scooter rides in the initial four-month-long pilot program. A report analyzing the first pilot program found 176 people went to emergency rooms over scooter injuries, most of which (83 percent) were not incurred in collisions with cars, scooters or pedestrians. Scooter riders are not allowed to ride in public parks, and are required by law to wear helmets. Riding e-scooters in Tom McCall Waterfront Park was popular during last year's pilot program, and issues arose when people parked the scooters in the park and waterfront multi-use pathway. PBOT is requiring companies to use geo-fencing technology to stop people from parking scooters in the park and on the path. They say you'll get a warning and fine if you do it repeatedly. PBOT is also marking off space for scooter parking throughout the city. However, legislators in Salem are considering a bill that would allow e-scooter riders to travel without helmets. PBOT has created a scooter map of the city to educate riders on the safest streets to ride on and indicate where scooter riding is prohibited. The map is available online at: http://map.escooterpdx.com ",https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/theyre-back-e-scooters-once-again-on-portland-city-streets/283-cb48a4a8-53bf-4c80-b120-acc05bd1c07c
E-scooter safety study: Most serious head injuries ‘preventable’ with helmet use,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,5,3,"E-scooter safety study: Most serious head injuries ‘preventable’ with helmet use. An examination of electric-scooter related injuries in one U.S. city found that while injuries are rare, nearly half of all hurt riders suffered a head injury that “may have been preventable” if riders had been wearing a helmet at the time. The Centers for Disease Control and Austin Public Health Department released a study Thursday examining e-scooter injuries in that city from Sept. 5 through Nov. 30 of last year. The report documented 190 injured scooter riders during that period (160 confirmed to be riding scooters at the time and 32 probable cases). The prevalence during that period equates to roughly 20 injuries per 100,000 trips taken on the dockless transportation device. According to the first-of-its-kind analysis from the CDC of scooter injuries, all but one of the injured riders was not wearing a helmet. “Studies have shown that bicycle riders reduce the risk of head and brain injuries by wearing a helmet,” the report’s authors said. “Helmet use might also reduce the risk of head and brain injuries in the event of an e-scooter crash.” The report comes as Portland’s second foray into the e-scooter transportation craze wraps up its first week. City transportation officials welcomed scooters back to Portland streets last Friday, this time for a 12-month period compared to a four-month trial in 2018. Helmets are required to operate an e-scooter in Oregon, but the city has focused much of its regulatory interest in directing scooter companies to penalize riders for operating on sidewalks or in public parks. The city’s press release on the device’s return last week doesn’t include the word helmet. Sidewalk riding and helmet issues were the top complaints lodged with the city during the 2018 pilot project. Ryan McConaghy, executive director of a group called the Micromobility Coalition, which represents e-scooter companies, told The Washington Post that the industry welcomed the CDC’s report and the focus on safety. But McConaghy said scooter users experience injury rates on part with bicyclists and far lower to the rate of motorists. “Like using a bike, motorcycle, or car, there is risk in operating a personal transportation vehicle,” McConaghy told the Post. “Car drivers face this risk every day — whether it is the risk of human error, collision with another commuter or poor conditions on the roads.” According to the National Safety Council, a nonprofit focused on eliminating preventable deaths, more than 40,000 people died in traffic crashes in 2017. The death rate equates to 12.35 per 100,000 people, according to the nonprofit. Some 4.6 million people were injured enough in a car crash in 2017 that they sought medical consultation. While serious scooter injuries are rare, the Austin-centric report’s authors said their analysis “likely underestimates the prevalence” of scooter-related injuries. But the researchers focused on investigating injuries that ended in a visit to a hospital emergency room or where riders were treated by emergency medical providers. The bulk of seriously injured riders in Austin were new to scooter riding, with 63% saying they had ridden a device nine times or fewer before the injury. One-third of riders were injured the first time riding a scooter, the report found. During the period examined by public health experts, just two people who weren’t riding a scooter were struck and injured to the point of needing emergency care (one cyclist, one pedestrian). Some other findings: 15%: experience traumatic brain injury 37%: of riders say they were going too fast on the scooters at the time of the crash 24%: Were traveling downhill when injured 16%: Were injured when colliding with or swerving to avoid a car or trip 55%: Were injured in the street 33% were injured on a sidewalk.

Worldwide electric scooter boom leads to more serious injuries and fatalities,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,6,6,"Andrew Hardy was crossing the street on an electric scooter in downtown Los Angeles when a car struck him at 50 miles per hour and flung him 15 feet in the air before he smacked his head on the pavement and fell unconscious. The 26-year-old snapped two bones in each leg, broke a thighbone, shattered a kneecap, punctured a lung and fractured three vertebrae in his neck, in addition to sustaining a head injury. ""My brother thought I was dead,"" said Hardy, who wasn't wearing a helmet. Doctors told Hardy he'd likely be paralyzed for life. Five months later, he has learned to walk again. But he says he'll never ride another scooter. ""These scooters should not be available to the public,"" Hardy said. ""Those things are like a death wish."" As stand-up electric scooters have rolled into more than 100 cities worldwide, many of the people riding them are ending up in the emergency room with serious injuries. Others have been killed. There are no comprehensive statistics available but a rough count by The Associated Press of media reports turned up at least 11 electric scooter rider deaths in the U.S. since the beginning of 2018. Nine were on rented scooters and two on ones the victims owned. With summer fast approaching, the numbers will undoubtedly grow as more riders take to the streets. Despite the risks, demand for the two-wheeled scooters continues to soar, popularized by companies like Lime and Bird. In the U.S. alone, riders took 38.5 million trips on rentable scooters in 2018, according to the National Association of City Transportation Officials. Many of those trips happened in Portland, where the city is in the second year of e-scooters on city streets. In April, city transportation officials welcomed scooters back for a 12-month period compared to a four-month trial in 2018. Helmets are required to operate an e-scooter in Oregon, but the city has focused much of its regulatory interest in directing scooter companies to penalize riders for operating on sidewalks or in public parks. Sidewalk riding and helmet issues were the top complaints lodged with the city during the 2018 pilot project. Riders adore the free-flying feel of the scooters that have a base the size of a skateboard and can rev up to 15 miles per hour. They're also cheap and convenient, costing about $1 to unlock with a smartphone app and about 15 cents per minute to ride. And in many cities, they can be dropped off just about anywhere after a rider reaches their destination. But pedestrians and motorists scorn the scooters as a nuisance at best and a danger at worst. Cities, meanwhile, can hardly keep up. In many cases, scooter-sharing companies dropped them onto sidewalks overnight without warning. Regulations vary from place to place. In New York and the U.K., electric scooters are illegal on public roads and sidewalks, even though riders routinely flout the law. Last week in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, a rider was struck and killed by a car just one day after scooters were introduced there, leading to immediate calls for a ban. And in Nashville, Tennessee, where another rider was killed, the city's mayor warned scooter operators they had 30 days to clean up their act or he would propose a ban. Fed up with the thousands of scooters flooding Paris streets, Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced new regulations Thursday limiting the number of scooter operators and imposing a 5 mile-per-hour speed limit in areas with heavy foot traffic. The city has already imposed a 135 euro ($150) fine on anyone who rides scooters on sidewalks. Isabelle Albertin, a pianist at Paris' famed Opera Garnier, suffered a double fracture of her right arm after she was run down by an electric scooter on May 17. She is suing the city and has started an organization to push for a ban. ""On the sidewalks of Paris, it's a total madhouse. We pedestrians are totally insecure,"" she told Le Parisien newspaper. Data on injuries or fatalities linked to scooters is hard to come by because the industry is so new. In Austin, Texas, public health officials working with the Centers for Disease Control counted 192 scooter-related injuries in three months in 2018. Nearly half were head injuries, including 15% that were traumatic brain injuries like concussions and bleeding of the brain. Less than 1% of the injured riders wore a helmet. Bird, one of the largest scooter-sharing companies, dropped its scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, California, in September 2017 and within a few months riders were showing up at the emergency room, according to Dr. Tarak Trivedi, an emergency room physician in Los Angeles and co-author of one of the first peer-reviewed studies of scooter injuries. The following year, Trivedi and his colleagues counted 249 scooter injuries, and more than 40% were head injuries. Just 4% were wearing a helmet. ""I don't think our roads are ready for this,"" Trivedi said. Bird and Lime both recommend that riders wear helmets, and they've handed out tens of thousands for free. But last year, Bird successfully fought a California proposal that would have required helmets for adults, maintaining that scooters should follow the same laws as electric bikes that don't require adult helmets. Bird says helmet requirements are off-putting to riders and could lead to fewer scooters on the road. Almost counterintuitively, the company argues that it's better to have more riders than less because it forces drivers to pay attention to them. ""There's a safety in numbers effect, where the motorists know that there's people out on the street, so they act accordingly,"" said Paul Steely White, director of safety policy and advocacy for Bird. Getting people to wear helmets is a challenge. Riders don't want exposure to lice or germs that could be found in shared helmets, and many make a spontaneous decision to scoot while they're already out and about. That was the case when Drew Howerton, 19, hopped on a Lime scooter on a whim last October in Austin. He recalls signing a waiver that said he should wear a helmet, but he didn't have one on him. ""I didn't show up in Austin thinking I'm going to ride a scooter today, better bring my helmet,"" Howerton said. Scooter-sharing companies generally restrict riding to those 18 years and up, but some children, or their parents, have found ways around that. A 5-year-old boy died in Oklahoma after he fell from a scooter he was riding on with his mother and was struck by a car. Worldwide electric scooter boom leads to more serious injuries and fatalities. Bird and Lime are taking steps to try to make scooters safer. After observing that scooter-related fatalities often occur after midnight when riders may have been drinking, Bird ceased operations after midnight. Lime halts rentals overnight in some markets but in most its scooters are available all night. Lime has also been updating the design of its scooters, with a broader wheel base and better suspension and braking; Bird is including more durable brakes and reinforced hardware to prevent failures. Both companies have been pushing cities for more bike lanes and better infrastructure as their riders navigate roads and traffic under conditions that were designed for cars and trucks. ""The reality is, cars continue to kill more people annually than any other mode of transportation,"" Lime said in a statement. ""We must address this issue together with cities, get people out of their vehicles, and build cities that put people first, with smarter infrastructure to protect riders."" For Howerton, his first experience with a scooter left him scarred. Even though he read the warning not to ride downhill, he did it anyway since hills are hard to avoid in Austin. When he tried to brake, he flew off the scooter and hit his head on the pavement, blood gushing into his eyes. “These companies, for the large part, they show up in cities and they just kind of dump these rideshare devices,” Howerton said. “They tout them as this really cool, innovative, public transportation thing that’s cheap and affordable and yeah it is, but they’re dangerous and they don’t think about the potential health consequences.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2019/06/worldwide-electric-scooter-boom-leads-to-more-serious-injuries-and-fatalities.html
"More scooters come to town, some riders still ignoring rules",Katu,ABC,"Portland, OR",2019,6,24,"More scooters come to town, some riders still ignoring rules. A new breed of e-scooters rolled into Portland earlier this month: scooters with seats. Portland Bureau of Transportation approved permits for California scooter maker Razor and the Tacoma-based company Shared. PBOT says that the seated e-scooters are a “direct response” to focus group requests to make the program more accessible, saying it offered a more favorable scoring in permits to companies that offered scooters with seats. They brought more than 700 seated scooters into the city. The citywide total between the five companies in the program, which include Lime, Bolt, and Spin, will be 1,975, which is just under the 2,043 allowed during the pilot program. Portland is more than two months into the e-scooter pilot program, set with new rules and regulations. Whether riders sit or stand to ride, the same rules apply. A KATU News crew hit the streets to see if riders are complying. A majority of them do, but there are still some who don't. Most of them know they can't ride scooters on the sidewalks, and they can't just park the scooters outside a designated space. Some of them don't know that they can't ride in any city park. ""I did ride around the waterfront, but I didn't know I wasn't supposed to,"" said one Portland e-scooter rider. The one rule all the riders who were interviewed know about, but don't follow is wearing a helmet. ""It's definitely something that I should consider doing. Don't tell my parents. I know it's wrong, to be fair,"" said another Portland e-scooter rider. ""Who carries a helmet with them unless you're on a bike? It seems like a strange rule,"" said one rider. PBOT told KATU at the beginning of the pilot program these rules would be better enforced and they're leaning on the scooter companies to help. KATU reached out to all three e-scooter companies in this pilot program, only Lime responded about enforcement. A representative said customer complaints and enforcement inquiries account for less than one percent of their reports. PBOT says they will will be issuing its first report of violations in the near future. ",https://katu.com/news/local/more-scooters-come-to-town-some-riders-still-ignoring-rules
Divers pull more than 50 e-scooters from Willamette River,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,6,25,"Divers pull more than 50 e-scooters from Willamette River. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office dive team show off the e-scooters and bikes they pulled from the Willamette River Tuesday and Wednesday. The team pulled more than 50 scooters and a few bikes from the river.Photo courtesy of the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. More than 50 e-scooters and a few bikes were pulled from the Willamette River in downtown Portland Tuesday and Wednesday by a county sheriff’s office dive team. The divers noticed the scooters in the river last month. Lime, Bird and Razor e-scooters were piled up in a boat Tuesday while a dive team searched along the downtown sea wall for more. Sgt. Brandon White from the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said he wasn’t sure who put the scooters in the river or why they were put there. “We advise those people not to park scooters in the River,” White said. Last month, White said the River Patrol and Dive Team were training in the Willamette River under the Hawthorne Bridge when they noticed the scooters. The divers were concerned that the scooters batteries could leak into the river, White said. They were carrying out the plan to get the scooters out of the river Tuesday. He said divers would be back Wednesday to search for more. In a tweet from the sheriff’s office Wednesday, a photo showed even more scooters piled up on a boat. The crew pulled out “57 scooters/bikes” in two days, according to another tweet from the office. The bikes pulled from the river appeared to be rentable Biketown bicycles. It’s not clear how long the scooters have been in the water, but some of the scooters pulled out Tuesday appeared to have rusted. The lights on one Lime scooter, however, were still working. The sheriff’s office has reached out to scooter companies to give them a chance to pick the scooters up, White said. Spokespersons from Bird and Lime responded in emails saying vandalizing the scooters is wrong and shouldn’t be accepted. Both said if people see a scooter being vandalized, they should report it. Lime vandalism can be reported at support@li.me and Bird vandalism can be reported at hello@bird.co. The Chief Operating Officer of Razor, Danny Simons, said in an email Razor does its best to track their scooters. He said the company is continuously working to minimize missing, stolen or vandalized scooters. The Biketown bicycles would be picked up Thursday, Biketown spokeswoman Dorothy Mitchell said. She said Biketown is glad the bikes were recovered and will assess them to see if they can be refurbished or used for parts.

"Two California ‘repo men’ are taking on the scourge of e-scooters, and they just might win",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,7,26,"Two California ‘repo men’ are taking on the scourge of e-scooters, and they just might win. The appeal of e-scooters is that you can find one just about anywhere in the central city and, when you’re done riding it, you can leave it anywhere. The problem, at least for scooter companies Bird and Lime’s operations in San Diego, is that their customers often leave them on private property. That, plus the fact that some San Diegans find the scooters a blight on both the cityscape and common human decency, has led to an aggressive “repo” operation in the California city that threatens the e-scooter business model. San Diego residents John Heinkel and Dan Borelli are not fans of e-scooters. They view them as vehicular litter and believe they bring out the worst in people, reported tech-news website The Verge. Some scooter riders knock over pedestrians and just keep going, for starters. This is a problem in every city where e-scooters can be found. “There may be a correlation between the number of irritated, at-risk pedestrians and the number of e-scooters resting on the bottom of the river,” a reader wrote to The Oregonian this month after the newspaper reported that a dive team had pulled more than 50 scooters out of the Willamette River. Scooter riders also abandon their rented rides in doorways, driveways and other places that are inconvenient or a hazard for people and businesses. And here is where San Diego’s e-scooters rise to the fore. Last year Heinkel and Borelli went into the “repo” business, which they call ScootScoop. When hotels, restaurants and others in San Diego find a scooter on their private property, they call ScootScoop. Heinkel and Borelli show up, photograph the scooter and write a “ticket” to document what they’re doing, then load the scooter on a flatbed truck and haul it off to a storage facility. They’ve impounded more than 10,000 scooters in a matter of months, but they admit there’s no evidence there are fewer scooters on San Diego’s roads and sidewalks. The scooter companies just keep bringing in more. The e-scooter business is, after all, big business. The repo operation has allegedly led to violence as scooter-company “freelancers” have tried to retrieve scooters from impound. It’s also led, inevitably, to lawsuits. “Heinkel and Borelli are accused in a lawsuit filed in California Superior Court in late March of improperly impounding Bird’s scooters and then ransoming them back to the $2 billion company,” The Verge wrote. “Lime filed a nearly identical suit soon after.” The repo men, for their part, say ransom is “a fake bully word that’s been made up to make our character look worse.” Heinkel seems confident that he and his partner are going win the legal battle, and if they do it very well could impact the e-scooter business not just in San Diego but everywhere. He says the impending court case comes down to “a very simple concept. They have taken their stuff and placed it on someone else’s property without permission.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2019/07/two-california-repo-men-are-taking-on-the-scourge-of-e-scooters-and-they-just-might-win.html
Lime to Offer Additional Scooters and Discounted Rides Near Lloyd Center During MAX Station Closures,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2019,8,1,"Lime to Offer Additional Scooters and Discounted Rides Near Lloyd Center During MAX Station Closures. TriMet’s work to improve the Lloyd MAX station will disrupt the red, blue and green MAX lines. E-scooter company Lime plans to deploy hundreds of scooters and offer discounted rides for commuters affected by the Lloyd District MAX train closures Aug. 4 through Aug. 17. TriMet's work to improve the Lloyd MAX station will affect the red, blue and green MAX lines, which will arrive less often and on special schedules during the two week period. To help commuters, Lime will give riders who start or finish trips in the vicinity of the Lloyd Center or Rose Quarter a free unlock—usually $1—for their first ten rides with the code LIME2MAX. Portland Bureau of Transportation has also temporarily increased the number of scooters allowed in the Lloyd District during this year's pilot program, so that Lime can deploy a total of 165 extra vehicles. The company aplans to have staff stationed at designated scooter parking areas to help riders navigate the MAX changes and park correctly and to sign up eligible riders for Lime's low fare program.

Portland will soon have more e-scooters than ever before,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,8,16,"Portland will soon have more e-scooters than ever before. Portland will soon have more electric scooters on the streets than at any time in 2018. On Thursday, the transportation agency announced that 655 additional scooters were approved to hit the streets as soon as possible. Bird, one of three companies that operated in Portland last year, is now authorized to bring 525 scooters to town. Portland separately gave two companies – Bolt and Spin – the go-ahead to expand their fleets. All told, some 655 new scooters could be available to rent via smartphones across town immediately, bringing the total number of scooters across town to 2,630. Last year the city had roughly 2,043 devices. Scooters are currently permitted for a 12-month period that started this April, and the city said it would give companies that followed specific guidelines (like urging safety, steering riders away from illegal sidewalk riding or ending rides in parks) the ability to expand their fleets over time. Those incentives, if met, could mean Portland would have as many as 9,000 eventually. Bureau of Transportation officials also released detailed analysis Thursday of a 10-week period documenting how many people were injured in scooter crashes, how many riders were ticketed or fined and how many complaints were submitted to the companies and the city. Dylan Rivera, a Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesman, said the city believed it had released more data about scooters than any city in the country. “We announced 10 weeks’ worth of e-scooter injury data, a few weeks after the end of that period,” Rivera said in an email Thursday, “By contrast, ODOT will report summer 2019 traffic injury data for all transportation modes in the summer of 2021 (1.5 years after the end of the calendar year).” Rivera said the city knew people were interested in how the program was going. “We’ll continue to share data throughout the one-year pilot program. For now, this is still a pilot program with new technology. The companies and the city are resolving a variety of technology issues to make data usable and transparent,” he said in an email. The city is receiving monthly reports from individual companies logging the anonymized complaints sent to them. Portland said it is auditing those responses, and their process includes going “a variety of tactics, including filing of secret-shopper style complaints and tracking how they are handled by the companies. Here are some stats from that 10-week period: - 307,457: Number of miles logged on scooters during that period. - 46: Multnomah County health officials estimated roughly it saw that many scooter-related trips to the emergency room, but stipulated those figures also included privately owned scooters in addition to the smartphone-based rental companies. - 16: Number of e-scooter “collisions” with cars or pedestrians, according to the city - 903: Complaints reported by the companies, which are in charge of tabulating complaints under this permit process. Those complaints were for parking issues or “poor riding behavior.” The city separately received 371 emails from the public about similar issues. - 116: Number of tickets issued for illegal riding on sidewalks, totaling $5,800. - 191: Number of tickets issued for illegal parking, totaling $3,120. - $15,800: Amount Portland has charged companies for their Right of Way Surcharge (The right of way surcharge ranges 5 cents to 20 cents, depending on the neighborhood. The city said it had not yet invoiced companies for a separate 25 cents-per-trip charge. Here are other questions we wanted to know, in a question and answer format. Some questions or answers are edited for brevity and clarity. Q: Does Portland collect data on how many scooters are parked in Waterfront Park? If so, what are the figures? A: “We have not yet analyzed the parking data to that level of detail. We will continue to analyze the data through the pilot program and will be looking at a variety of potential issues including impacts on parks.” Q: This scooter period was supposed to include a “geofence” to discourage riders from parking their scooters in Waterfront Park and elsewhere. How is that going so far? A: “We are auditing companies’ compliance with the geofencing rules to ensure they are complying. This includes anonymous road testing of e-scooters. Right now, we believe the companies are following our rules for geofencing. They are notifying their customers when they have entered a restricted area. We are also auditing companies to make sure their scooters cannot end a trip in city parks (not just waterfront park). Anyone who abandons a scooter in a park is paying a premium because the e-scooters consistently do not allow you to end a trip in a park. They keep the meter running: The trip’s charges continue to add up, until it shuts down from several minutes of inactivity. We’ll continue to gather information about the effectiveness of this approach.” Q: The city previously fined companies for not providing scooters in east Portland, and on Thursday noted that devices weren’t reliably available in some neighborhoods there. Have any companies been fined for not meeting that threshold this time? A: “This is still a requirement. We have not issued any penalties in 2019 for failing to meet this requirement.” ",https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2019/08/portland-will-soon-have-more-e-scooters-than-ever-before.html
"Your Portland e-scooter questions, answered",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,8,29,"Your Portland e-scooter questions, answered. E-scooters have arrived in Portland. Maybe you've seen some youths riding them around and you're wondering, Seinfeld-like, what's the deal? Here are your questions, answered by city officials, e-scooter spokespeople and this reporter, who has ridden several scooters, several times. How do you find a scooter? First, you need a smartphone. Then you need to download the app for whichever scooter company you want, As of Friday afternoon, your options are Bird and LimeBike. Both apps have maps that will show you where there are available scooters. Beware! LimeBike also has actual e-bikes, which are cool but not scooters. Make sure you're going to get a scooter by looking for the scooter icon on the map. Then what? Using the app and your phone's camera, you scan a code and unlock the scooter. How much do scooters cost? Both Bird and LimeBike are $1 to unlock and $.15 per minute. How does payment work? On Bird, you enter your credit card information and then are charged. On Lime, you load a balance before you ride -- $10, $20 or $50. What do you do when you're done? You have to end the ride using the app. Park the scooter outside of walkways -- next to a bike rack is good but just make sure it isn't impeding the flow of pedestrian travel. Do you need a driver's license? Before your first ride, Bird makes you scan your driver's license. Lime does not. Do you need a helmet? Yes, that's the law. How old do you have to be to ride an e-scooter? 18. How fast do scooters go? Both Lime and Bird said the scooters go 15 mph. Bird has no gauges to tell a rider their speed, but Lime scooters have a screen between the handlebars that tells the rider how fast they're going, among other things. It should be noted that this reporter rode a Lime scooter and got it up to 19 mph. How are the scooters charged? Charging the e-scooters is what makes them part of the gig economy. ""We anticipate that many will be scooped up by juicers, who can earn money by collecting, charging, and redeploying scooters,"" Lime spokeswoman Katherine Mackinnon said. ""The Lime team will collect any remaining scooters and charge them, then redeploy in the morning."" For Bird scooters, the person picking up the scooter is called simply a ""Charger."" Do e-scooters shut down at a certain time of night? When can they start up again? Bird said no new rides can be started after dusk. Chargers start picking up scooters at dusk and place them in their designated ""nests"" by 7 a.m. How should riders signal a turn? Lime suggested using bike riding hand signals, though in practice this is difficult because riders will generally want both hands on the scooter for stability. Can you get a DUI on a e-scooter? ""Yes,"" John Brady, spokesman for Portland Bureau of Transportation, said by email. Can you get a ticket for riding without a helmet or on the sidewalk? Another yes, according to Brady. Is it legal to ride e-scooters on multiuse trails like along the waterfront and the Springwater Corridor? ""By city code, scooters aren't allowed in city parks,"" Brady said. ""Since the esplanade and Springwater trail are part of Portland Parks, people can't ride scooters on these trails."" Mark Ross, spokesman for Portland Parks and Recreation, said via email that park employees enforce this rule first by letting riders know it exists. ""They first ask them to please comply,"" Ross said. ""I'm sure it doesn't happen often, but riders could end up getting a warning."" ""If warnings are violated then they could result in an exclusion,"" he added, ""and a violation of an exclusion could be criminal trespass."" Is the city enforcing these things? ""Education first, enforcement second,"" Brady said. ""Since this is so new and there is always a learning curve associated with new transportation options, we are going to focus on educating riders first. That's why we have been publicizing our rules of the road and safe riding messaging. It's also why we've required the companies to inform their customers about how to ride safely and legally. If we see that these and other education efforts aren't successful, we can always move to enforcement.""

Stop blocking Portland sidewalks with e-scooters: Disability rights group sends a message,KGW,NBC,"Portland, OR",2019,10,21,"Stop blocking Portland sidewalks with e-scooters: Disability rights group sends a message. Portland transportation officials have issued more than 500 warnings and penalties since April, and Disability Rights Oregon has gotten hundreds of complaints. E-scooters can be a convenient way to get around Portland. But they can also be inconvenient and even dangerous when used the wrong way. So the Portland Bureau of Transporation, Disability Rights Oregon and Lime Scooters are teaming up to make sure riders know what not to do, and why. They’re sending the message through a video they shot in Northwest Portland on Monday morning. They plan to push the video out on social media and post it to their websites. The groups want people to stop riding e-scooters on sidewalks and parking them across sidewalks and curb ramps. Not only are those two things against the law in the city of Portland, but they're also hazardous for people with disabilities – and pedestrians in general. Imagine if you used a wheelchair or mobility device and have to get around a scooter, or a pack of scooters, parked in the middle of the sidewalk. Or imagine you're blind or vision-impaired and can't see a scooter whizzing past you. Either scenario could lead to you falling or getting hit and getting seriously injured. In Portland, you’re supposed to ride e-scooters in the street, or in bike lanes where present. As for parking, park as close as you can to the curb in what’s referred to as the “furnishing zone,” an area where you’ll see trees, landscaping or street lights. Be sure not to park them on curb ramps, which provide accessibility for people with disabilities. Park scooters away from buildings as well; people who use white canes need to run their canes along buildings in order to navigate. Lime general manager Jeremy Nelson says you have to leave at least 3 feet of space open for people to get by. When the city of Portland rolled out an e-scooter pilot program last year, Disability Rights Oregon got hundreds of complaints from people with disabilities and from seniors. When the group learned the second pilot was in the works, legal director Emily Cooper says they reached out to the city and met with them to express their concerns. Among their asks: Ticket people who break the rules by riding on sidewalks, and increase the fines. “Our primary concern is safety. Our sidewalks are supposed to be free and equal for everyone to move about freely in our city so that was what we really wanted to fix with the second pilot,” Cooper said. “We really think if users really understood what was at stake by riding on the sidewalk or parking poorly they would understand and stop doing it.” The city can crack down on people violating city code around e-scooter riding. PBOT staff can take photos and jot down the numbers of the front of the scooter, along with dates, times and locations of where they saw someone breaking the rules. Then they work with the e-scooter companies to issue the warning or fine to the rider. “The majority of instances where a rider is getting a report they’re not doing something right, they’re unaware,"" Nelson said. ""So it’s a great opportunity for us to tell them what they should be doing and how that differs from what they had done. And we haven’t seen actually anybody with repeated violations."" Transportation officials say they've issued more than 500 warnings and penalties since April. But the challenge with enforcement is PBOT patrollers have to catch someone in the act. You, personally, can contact the e-scooter company directly if you see an issue and want to report it. According to the city, companies are required to report to PBOT every month regarding complaints and reports submitted to them. The bureau of transportation says they audit each company and the complaint system regularly.

Portland extends e-scooter pilot program through 2020,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2019,12,20,"Portland extends e-scooter pilot program through 2020. A city pilot program for electric scooters will be extended another eight months, allowing people to continue riding the devices in Portland through the end of next year. The Portland Bureau of Transportation announced Friday that it doesn’t plan to issue any new permits to scooter vendors in the city, leaving Bird, Lime, Razor, Shared and Spin as the only participants in its Shared Electric Scooter Pilot Program. The companies are allowed to have more than 2,800 e-scooters on the streets between them, with the most being 833 permitted for Spin and 200 for Shared. Spin was allowed to expand its fleet by nearly 200 scooters after meeting specific city guidelines, such as steering riders away from illegally using them on sidewalks and urging riding safety, said Dylan Rivera, a Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesperson. The pilot program extension allows the city to continue studying the impacts of e-scooters on Portland’s transportation system and receive feedback from the public, Rivera said. By the end of this pilot, officials will have a better idea if e-scooters should be a permanent fixture in Portland, he said. The city is in the midst of its second e-scooter pilot program, which began with an initial 12-month trial run in April. The program is now scheduled to end Dec. 31, 2020. Bolt, which was among the participating vendors, had its permit suspended Dec. 8 after the Florida-based company pulled its e-scooters from Portland, according to Rivera. “We didn’t get much of an explanation,” he said. “Our understanding is we’re not the only city where this has happened, but it’s all a bit of a mystery to us.” Bolt was permitted to have 214 e-scooters, and Rivera said the city is open to continue working with the vendor if they choose to return to Portland. Bolt Mobility didn’t immediately respond to a message for comment Friday. The transportation bureau said riders have used e-scooters in more than 954,000 trips between April and November — traveling more than 1 million miles. The bureau said 57 warnings and 723 fines for improper parking or riding on sidewalks have been issued in the same time period. The bureau also said data from the Multnomah County Health Department showed injuries related to e-scooters have led to 183 trips to hospital and urgent care clinics from April to September. Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, who oversees the transportation bureau, said in a statement that public feedback showed sidewalk riding and improper parking were the top issues Portlanders had with e-scooters last year. She said she plans to keep monitoring the pilot program to make sure e-scooters are safely used in the city.

"A New Study Shows a Dramatic Increase in E-Scooter Injuries, But Doesn’t Specifically Cite Portland Data",Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2020,1,13,"A New Study Shows a Dramatic Increase in E-Scooter Injuries, But Doesn’t Specifically Cite Portland Data. The proportion of e-scooter-related hospital admissions for people 18 to 34 increased by 354 percent. A new study from the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that e-scooter injuries have increased dramatically nationwide in the last year. Researchers with the University of California San Francisco evaluated data from emergency rooms across the U.S. and determined that between 2014 and 2018, 39,113 e-scooter injuries occurred and that there was ""a dramatic increase in injuries and admissions from 2017 to 2018 associated with e-scooter use."" E-scooters are quickly becoming commonplace in Portland, but the study didn't specifically cite Portland data. Benjamin Breyer, one of the study's authors, says the injury data can't be separated out by city. Nationwide, the study found that during the five-year period, the proportion of e-scooter-related hospital admissions for people 18 to 34 increased by 354 percent. In 2018, 30 percent of e-scooter crashes led to head injuries while the most common types of injuries were fractures, contusions and abrasions. ""The nearly doubling of incident e-scooter trauma calls for improved rider safety measures and regulation,"" the study noted, adding that the percentage of e-scooter riders with head injuries was more than double that of bicyclists. ""E-scooter companies should facilitate and encourage helmet use by increasing helmet access,"" researchers wrote. The study did not research the scenarios that caused the crashes, nor alcohol or helmet use. Portland is currently trying out e-scooters in a second pilot program. The trial started April 26, and last month the Portland Bureau of Transportation extended the program's end to Dec. 31, 2020. Six companies—Bird, Bold, Lime, Razor, Shared and Spin—are currently operating in Portland. In 2019, PBOT wrote in a statement, the Multnomah County Health Department identified 183 e-scooter related emergency departments and urgent care clinic visits.

Portland loses another e-scooter option as Shared pulls its vehicles from city streets,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2020,2,19,"Portland loses another e-scooter option as Shared pulls its vehicles from city streets. Portland’s e-scooter fleet became a little less funky, and comfy, last week. Shared, the Tacoma-based startup that had 200 bright white and red seated scooters available to rent throughout Portland, abruptly shut down. The company notified Portland transportation officials via email Saturday. It was not operating in any other city. Shared’s devices were outliers in the still evolving on-demand electric scooter industry. The scooters weighed 80 pounds and used 12-inch-diameter tires that were 8 inches wide. City officials said they expected the company to remove the scooters from sidewalks and streets as soon as possible “I wanted to reach out today and thank you for the opportunity for Shared to operate in Portland until now,” Braydon Butungbacal, the company’s CEO said in an email Saturday. “Unfortunately, we’ll be closing up our Portland operations at this point due to extreme difficulty in further fundraising to support the venture to continue to grow it.” “It’s been an enjoyable journey that we’re sad to see end, but a meaningful one,” he wrote. Butungbacal did not respond to a request for comment. Shared’s departure follows on the heels of Bolt’s decision in December to leave Portland. That leaves some 2,665 permitted scooters in town as of this month, with industry giants like Lime, Spin and Bird remaining. Razor scooters, which are also seated devices, still has a fleet in town. Portland extended the lengthy e-scooter “pilot” program through the end of 2020. Dylan Rivera, a Portland transportation spokesman, said the city was sad to see Shared go “particularly since their seated scooter with larger tires appeared to make the vehicle more appealing and more useful for more people.” “Additionally, we believe the size of their scooter also generally made sidewalk riding less of an issue,” Rivera said in an email. He added that the city expected to see some companies come and go, given the “market volatility” in the still-changing e-scooter industry. Portland first allowed e-scooters to operate on city streets in 2018. Rivera said the city assumes the company will promptly remove scooters from town.

"Portland startup Ride Report raises $10 million to support e-scooters, rental bikes",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2020,3,12,"Portland startup Ride Report raises $10 million to support e-scooters, rental bikes. Ride Report, a Portland startup that works with cities to help them manage e-scooters, rental bikes and similar “micromobility” transportation options, has raised $10 million in venture capital. The five-year-old company says it’s working with more than 60 cities worldwide, including Portland, Austin and Wellington, New Zealand. Ride Report enables cities to track vehicle locations and usage so they can monitor if scooters are parked impermissibly, for example, or if a company has more vehicles operating in a region than allowed under local regulations. The company says its tools can help cities regulate and manage such vehicles. “The data can be so difficult to understand and internalize,” said Jess Stetson, Ride Report’s head of growth. She said the company aims to make that manageable so cities can understand how people are using scooters and rental bikes and what steps the cities should take to regulate them. “We want to provide cities with the right information that they need to make those decisions,” Stetson said. The company employs 18, including 16 at its Portland headquarters. Thursday’s funding comes from Unusual Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm that backs companies in very early stages.

Portland health care workers can get free e-scooter rides,Portland Tribune,Pamplin Media Group,"Portland, OR",2020,4,1,"Portland health care workers can get free e-scooter rides. Spin, the electric scooter company owned by Ford, offers 30 minute rides for free in eight cities. If you see a white coat zipping down the streets of Portland, don't be too surprised. Spin — the electric scooter company purchased by car manufacturer Ford in 2018 — is now offering free 30-minute rides and helmets to doctors, nurses, technicians, pharmacists, aides and other hospital employees in eight cities. That includes Portland, as well as Baltimore, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C. and Tampa. The offer rolled out on April 1 and will last through April 30. The promotion is apparently a tribute to the ""countless healthcare professionals who are on the frontlines working tirelessly to keep us safe and healthy"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a company announcement. To apply, you'll need to download the Spin smartphone app, as well as take photos of your health care ID and state ID cards and submit them here. Approval can take 24 to 48 hours, and the company promises to offer a free ticket to ride to more types of essential service workers soon. Spin's unique form of honoring those battling the coronavirus stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city's two-wheeled fleet. According to Willamette Week, e-scooter operators Lime and Bird ceased operations indefinitely in mid March, while Razor has slimmed down its deployment.

"E-scooter companies ditch Portland, ridership plummets amid coronavirus pandemic",Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2020,4,3,"E-scooter companies ditch Portland, ridership plummets amid coronavirus pandemic. TriMet ridership is plummeting, state highway officials say traffic volume is down 40% in some areas due to the coronavirus pandemic, but e-scooters and Portland’s Biketown rental service are still available. But ridership, it would come as no surprise, has cratered. Bird and Lime, two of the international leaders in the so-called micro-mobility industry suspended operations March 17. Razor, which operates a seated scooter fleet, took some of its vehicles off the road. “As with other forms of public transit and transportation, we would encourage people to wash their hands thoroughly after riding a scooter,” John Brady a city transportation spokesman said. “People should adhere to the Stay Home, Save Lives order and only travel if it is essential,” he said, citing Gov. Kate Brown’s March 23 executive order. According to ridership figures provided to The Oregonian/OregonLive, e-scooter use was at its highest point of the year the same week health officials publicized the first known case of the novel coronavirus. The week of Feb. 24 saw 12,320 scooter trips. Ridership started going down from there. The week of March 16 saw 4,029 total trips. Last week, just 197 e-scooter trips were registered in Portland. “To the extent that this is an indication that people are following social distancing advice and also the order to avoid all but essential travel this is positive,” Brady said. Spin, another e-scooter company, hasn’t removed vehicles but has stepped up its sanitation procedures. The company has a disclosure if you open the app these days: “While we urge everyone to follow their local government’s guidance to stay home, we wanted to let you know our scooters are available for those of you who must travel.” Spin urged riders to “wash or sanitize your hands” before or after riding. In a post on Medium, Spin’s cofounders wrote that they shuttered operations in some cities but kept open in others like Portland where they feel “we can make an impact.” Biketown, the more than 1,000 orange rental bikes across town, is also operating as usual. But ridership, similarly, cratered in recent weeks. According to the most recent available figures, just 138 rides occurred March 30.

Bird and Lime e-scooters return small fleets to Portland despite stay-home order,Oregon Live,The Oregonian,"Portland, OR",2020,5,14,"Bird and Lime e-scooters return small fleets to Portland despite stay-home order. Bird and Lime, two of the world’s most prominent e-scooter companies, said this week they are redeploying small fleets in Portland. The so-called micro-mobility companies’ return comes nearly two months after both suspended operations in Portland, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. Their reappearance occurs despite the Portland metro area remaining under a stay-home order from Gov. Kate Brown. That order hasn’t deterred the companies, which both made marketing pitches to woo healthcare workers to use their services. Nor does the stay-home order direct people not to ride bikes, scooters, skateboards or any other form of transport when going to work, grocery stores or on errands users consider essential. Maurice Henderson, Bird’s director of government partnerships, is ebullient about his company’s odds of getting patrons to ride e-scooters, which during normal times projected an air of fun and freedom as opposed to essential travel amid a lockdown. Being alone on a scooter instead of sharing a bus or MAX car with others has a new appeal, he noted. “We still have a long way to go, but today, skies are bluer,” Henderson said. Maurice Henderson, Bird’s director of government partnerships and a former TriMet executive and aide to Mayor Ted Wheeler. “The air is cleaner. And Bird is the perfect solo ride to get Portlanders where they need to go.” Bird said it is offering free rides to healthcare and emergency personnel. “Eligible riders will receive two free 30-minute riders per day,” the company said in a statement, for “as long as it takes” to recover from the health crisis. The company has an online application where eligible workers are asked to submit photos of their work IDs to qualify for the free rides. Lime is also offering discounts to health care workers through what it’s calling its Lime Aid program, which includes one free 30-minute ride per day, with similar online photo verification. “The goal is to help workers who might otherwise have difficulty, either because they don’t want to take public transit or rideshare or because the public transit is running with service reductions,” said Alex Youn, a company spokesman. “As you know, scooters offer a socially isolating way of traveling and can help alleviate concerns over traveling in proximity to others."" Lime’s health care program expires at the end of May. Spin and Razor, two other scooter companies, have kept their devices in the city during the pandemic, though the latter reduced its fleet. Spin has a similar free ride program for healthcare workers, which runs through May. It is also discounting rides for all users. John Brady, a city transportation spokesman, confirmed the companies are redeploying limited fleets. Bird has more than 100 scooters and Lime plans to disperse 200 devices, according to Brady. “As with any other public transportation option, Portlanders should use e-scooters in accordance with the regulations and guidance from the Governor's Office and our public health expert,” Brady said in an email. “Trips should be limited to essential travel, to get fresh air close to home or for travel to facilities/businesses that have been allowed to re-open.” Brady said users should “maintain safe physical distancing” and wash or sanitize hands after riding.

More E-Scooters Are Returning to Portland’s Streets. But Will People Ride Them?,Portland Monthly,,"Portland, OR",2020,5,24,"More E-Scooters Are Returning to Portland’s Streets. But Will People Ride Them? Pondering the future of micro-mobility in a coronavirus-scarred world. One sign that the Portland metro area is tiptoeing toward loosening some of the stringent stay-at-home regulations: scooters are reappearing on city streets in greater numbers. Backers say they’re hoping that the pandemic-induced pause—scooter traffic shriveled to virtually nothing during late March and early April, per data from the Portland Bureau of Transportation—will be a chance for a fresh start for scooters in the city, which have, at times, had a bumpy ride. On the one hand, scooters and their ride-sharing brethren, the orange bike fleet maintained by Biketown, are pretty ideal for social distancing. You’re outside, it’s just you, and it’s faster than yet another walk. On the other hand, the idea of gripping onto handlebars that another rider has recently been hanging onto feels not a little bit peculiar for those who’ve been scrupulously keeping their distance from the rest of humanity for weeks. (Of note: coronavirus is most often spread via tiny droplets that we cough or sneeze out. If said droplets fall on a surface that we touch and then touch our face, the infection can spread, though the Centers for Disease Control says that’s not the main source of transmission.) Maurice Henderson, director of government relations at Santa Monica-based Bird, which has about 200 scooters on the streets in Portland right now, says sanitization practices have been stepped up, and that 13 high-touch contact points on the company’s fleet—including the neck, the bell, and the throttle—are getting washed “several” times a day, though not necessarily after each individual rider. “In the cities where we have re-engaged, we are providing a service for those essential trips that need to be taken,” says Henderson, a former chief of staff to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and chief operating officer at Tri-Met who now lives in Bend. The pandemic has not been particularly kind to the e-scooter industry overall. Most of the major players, including Lime and Bird, have reported lay-offs and pulled much of their fleet off of city streets. Still, there are encouraging signs for the industry: cities from Portland to Paris have been closing streets to all but neighborhood traffic to make more room for cyclists, joggers, pedestrians and, yes, scooter users. Some are going further: cities across Germany are erecting hundreds of miles of pop-up bicycle/e-scooter lanes in anticipation of people shying away from buses and subways for months on end. Portland has taken a firmer hand in partnering with the various players in the e-scooter market from the beginning, as opposed to the pop-up, ask-forgiveness-not-permission model in other cities. During the height of the pandemic, the city’s transportation bureau partnered up with e-scooter company Spin to waive daily fees in exchange for a consumer price chop of 50 percent per ride. Spin and Bird have also both offered free rides to medical and emergency response professionals. In an April article for CityLab, transportation analysts David Zipper and Marla Westervelt suggested that cities should be prepared to subsidize e-scooters and bike shares, to help fill in the gaps long-term if commuters continue to shy away from mass transit. That’s a tough ask in Portland, though, where the city council on Friday signed off on a budget that was $75 million below target, due to the drop in revenue from the coronavirus fallout. Meanwhile, data shows that after bottoming out at just 1,425 total e-scooter trips citywide between March 30 and April 5, usage has slowly rebounded, though it’s still well below normal. Between May 11 and May 17, PBOT’s data shows that there were 7,339 e-scooter rides across the city. If you’re one of those, know that you’re contributing to science: researchers at Portland State and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville are teaming up to study the effects of the pandemic commuters over the coming months, to see if more people do turn to bike shares and e-scooters.

Portland Temporarily Bans E-Scooters Because of the Citywide Curfew,Willamette Week,,"Portland, OR",2020,5,31,"Portland Temporarily Bans E-Scooters Because of the Citywide Curfew. News and eyewitness accounts from this weekend's disturbance reported scooters being used as projectiles to smash store windows. After two days of civil unrest, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has extended a citywide curfew for a second night. One result: Public transit—including e-scooters—will be temporarily suspended in the areas where the protests have concentrated. On Saturday, Wheeler implemented a curfew across Portland after a Friday vigil for George Floyd, a black man killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, ended in a riot downtown. Clashes between police and protestors continued Saturday, in Portland and across the country, prompting Wheeler to renew the curfew Sunday. As a result, TriMet announced it is stopping bus, MAX and street car service in downtown Portland for the evening. In addition, scooter companies have been ordered to suspend operations throughout Southwest and Northwest Portland, as well as the Central Eastside and the Lloyd District. ""In these areas, companies have implemented geofences, disabling scooters so they cannot be used, and company staff have been physically removing scooters from the right-of-way,"" Jacob Sherman, manager of the city's e-scooter program, wrote in an email to a constituent. ""This began yesterday and I am told should be completed today."" The concern over the prevalence of e-scooters was raised by Bob Weinstein, an organizer for Save Our Sidewalks, an anti-scooter lobbying group. In an email to Sherman, Weinstein wrote that news and eyewitness accounts from this weekend's disturbance reported scooters being used as projectiles to smash store windows. Sherman wrote that both Lime and Spin have sent crews to retrieve scooters in advance of the curfew. According to Weinstein, however, many scooters remained on the streets of Northwest Portland as of 5 pm Sunday. Tonight's curfew goes into effect at 8 pm and lasts through 6 am Monday. The Oregon Department of Transportation announced shortly after 6 pm that it had closed freeway exits into downtown Portland—a move without precedent in recent memory. ""At the request of the Portland Police Bureau, ODOT has closed freeway off-ramps leading to downtown Portland,"" ODOT spokesman Don Hamilton wrote. ""This includes off-ramps from U.S. 26, I-5, I-84 and I-405. We expect these closures to be in place until midnight tonight but conditions may change as we continue working with the Portland Police Bureau.""

Portland e-scooter ridership ramping up after COVID-19 outbreak,KGW,NBC,"Portland, OR",2020,7,22,"Portland e-scooter ridership ramping up after COVID-19 outbreak. E-scooter companies say they're sanitizing them, some deploying self-cleaning adhesive, and there are more available to ride now since the pandemic started. When the coronavirus pandemic first started, and Oregon was put under a stay-at-home order, ridership of buses, Max trains and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, plummeted. They still haven't recovered, with just a fraction of the normal ridership feeling comfortable enough to take them again. According to two of Portland's five e-scooter companies who commented to KGW, ridership has ramped back up since the shutdown orders were lifted. At least one company, Bolt, says ridership on her app is higher now than before the pandemic. First though, let's talk about cleanliness and sanitation, because many people certainly have qualms about touching a public surface, left out in the open for anything to happen to on a good day. But Portland's e-scooter companies are doing various levels of regular sanitization. We bumped into Crystal Thomas, who works for Spin scooters. By 8:00 o'clock every morning, she has to have 15% of their 950 scooters parked east of the 205 freeway as part of the city's equity clause. She can haul 60 at a time in her work van to go re-charge and sanitize at their warehouse. ""We spray down every scooter. It's a bleach and water solution, very basic but very strong and efficient."" Thomas says she sprays them when she puts them in the van, and then they are sprayed with disinfectant at the warehouse before they're brought back to the streets. Bolt has gone even further, applying handlebar and brake lever stickers that attract UV light to oxidize bacteria, effectively self-cleaning when in the sunshine. ""The people riding our scooters can understand and appreciate where they're putting their hands, are the cleanest places on the scooters,"" VP of Operations at Bolt, Will Nicholas, said. Not all Bolt scooters have those sticker wraps yet. We spotted several downtown that didn't have them. They're working to get the entire fleet covered in a month's time. Bolt says because they use snap-on replaceable batteries, workers are sanitizing each scooter more often, and in some cases between rides, each time they put on new batteries. RIDERSHIP Like you would expect, e-scooter ridership plummeted when the stay-at-home orders came down. Nobody was going anywhere. Nobody wanted to touch public surfaces. But now, at least according to Bolt, their numbers are much better. ""Since early June, we've seen a steady increase that's outpaced the ridership that we saw at the end of 2019 and early 2020,"" said Nicholas of Bolt. Crystal Thomas says her company Spin had 600 scooters available in Pdx last year. Now, she says, they hover around 1,000. Lime had about 300 on the roads when we checked their app on a Thursday morning. Bolt has just under 200 in the Rose City. Razor has hundreds too. And on their app, at the bottom is a dialogue box reading: ""By order of the City, riding is temporarily prohibited between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. in certain areas of downtown Portland."" It's because of the protests. The scooters just won't work in that small geo-fenced area. Portland's Bureau of Transportation says scooter companies aren't deploying as many as they could: The week of July 13-17 the average number of scooters for rent was 1,683, which is well below the current maximum fleet size of 3,115 total scooters. ""Despite the fact that ridership hasn’t returned to 2019 levels, PBOT believes that shared scooters and shared bikes have a role to play in responding to Covid-19 because they provide an outdoor, healthy transportation option. We look forward to seeing how e-scooters help meet community needs, as we look to reopening,"" spokesman Dylan Rivera told KGW. Bottom line, bring your own wipes and hand sanitizer, but know that riding the streets solo is back and stronger than ever. One interesting note, Thomas says Spin scooters are now about 50% heavier than they used to be. It's to make it harder for vandals to throw them in the river, up into trees and generally break, steal or vandalize them like we've seen over the past year.

Column: Bird scooters are in San Diego. Question is: Will they fly?,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,2,9,"Column: Bird scooters are in San Diego. Question is: Will they fly? San Diego birth announcement: Height: 36 inches. Weight: 26 pounds. Name: Bird. Date: mid-January. The delivery of a passel of simple black motorized scooters to San Diego promises to be a boon for time-pressed pedestrians — and possibly an irritant to a few others. The battery-operated Bird scooter employs GPS, online payment and Uber-style technology, as might be expected since it is the dream child of the ex-VP of Driver Growth for Uber and past COO of Lyft, Travis VanderZanden. The USC grad is a former resident of Pacific Beach and Little Italy who worked for five years at Qualcomm. “I love San Diego,” said VanderZanden, 39, now based in Santa Monica. He added that traffic congestion has gotten worse, however. He sees the Bird as a transportation alternative that reduces carbon emissions by getting people out of their cars. I downloaded the Bird Ride app and counted more than 100 Bird scooters available at various locations in Bird Rock, Pacific Beach and Mission Beach, many at retail outlets, banks and cafés. Once the Bird Ride app is downloaded on a smartphone, renters can unlock the nearest scooter, hop on and ride it for a base fee of $1, plus 15 cents a minute at speeds of up to 15 mph. It’s designed for short-distance travelers. The Bird is all the rage in Venice, Marina del Rey, Culver City and Santa Monica, where it debuted last fall. Renters are required to be at least 18, have a driver’s license, wear a helmet and ride in bike lanes. But reports in Los Angeles County show that riders don’t always follow the rules, creating safety concerns and headaches for law enforcement. Also, in Santa Monica, the company is working with the city to resolve a legal dispute over business licensing and rider citations. Bird Ride obtained a San Diego business tax license, but “it’s a new technology,” said Anthony Santacroce, a spokesman for the city of an Diego. He explained that there are public safety and right-of-way concerns that still need to be addressed. Unlike ride-sharing bikes, San Diego doesn’t have scooter docking stations in approved locations, and users can abandon the scooters anywhere. Santacroce has heard reports of a few nuisance complaints from businesses and individuals. VanderZanden said his company collects the bikes every evening at about 8 p.m. (or when battery power gets low), recharges them and returns them each morning to businesses amenable to having the scooters on their property. “We’ve had overwhelming support from local businesses,” said VanderZanden, adding that he is willing to work with the city. As for the future, VanderZanden stressed that this is a pilot program. “Right now we are still testing. We’re not committing to expanding or keeping the scooters in San Diego.” TV soap: Saatchi & Saatchi, the ad agency that produced the Super Bowl ad campaign dubbed “It’s a Tide Ad,” is truly cleaning up. The Tide commercials star David Harbour of “Stranger Things,” which is appropriate considering it’s a bit strange that an ad spoofing other popular product commercials dominated the competition. The Tide campaign was ranked No. 1 by Adweek and won the Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad campaign, which is judged by advertising executives. All this has made an 11-year-old North County actress, Audrey Casson, who appeared in the ad, a very happy girl. She had a bit part in the final scene of Tide’s first 45-second commercial, but considering the game was broadcast to 103.4 million viewers and the ad has recorded more than 7 million hits on YouTube, that’s a lot of exposure. Audrey, who wears a mustard-colored shirt, portrays Harbour’s daughter sitting on a chair next to the sofa bearing Harbour and other family members. The Solana Santa Fe Elementary School student has been acting for the past four years. She has appeared on an episode of “American Horror Story,” co-starred in a made-for-TV movie, “Meet My Valentine,” and has a key role in a soon-to-be announced feature film. When Audrey tried out for the Tide commercial, she had no idea it would be airing during the Super Bowl until she arrived on set, said her father, Chase Casson, of Del Mar. Her impression of Harbour? “Awesome — so nice and funny.” Rest of the story: Father Joe Carroll is back home and says he’s feeling great after surgery to alleviate a persistent infection following his foot amputation three years ago. An avowed Philadelphia Eagles fan, he returned home eager to watch last Sunday’s Super Bowl game, only to learn that cable service was out in his neighborhood. “The surgery was nothing, but not having my TV was murder,” says Father Joe. It took five days for AT&T to restore service. “I had to learn how to pray again,” he says. The founder of Father Joe’s Villages, who had put out a plea to the community for blood donations through the San Diego Blood Bank, ended up not needing a transfusion. Nevertheless, he is encouraging blood donations to continue through Valentine’s Day. More than 241 pints of blood were collected in Father Joe’s name as of Friday, says Claudine Van Gonka, blood bank spokeswoman. The response was so good “they want me to get sick again next year,” quips the Catholic priest. ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/columnists/diane-bell/sd-me-bell-20180210-story.html
Beachgoers flock to the new trend: Bird scooters,sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2018,2,16,"Beachgoers flock to the new trend: Bird scooters. Heard of car or bike share? Now there’s scooter share in Pacific Beach. Black-hued “Bird” Segway Kickscooter ES1 Electric Scooters, retailing for $399, are seemingly everywhere these days along the beachfront. The 30- to 40-pound dockless electric scooters, capable of speeds up to 15 mph, are available through a scooter-share service via a smartphone app. The scooter-share startup, Bird, was begun by Travis VanderZanden, who was previously an executive with Uber and Lyft ride sharing. Launched in September 2017, tens of thousands of people have already ridden Bird. The company started in Los Angeles, and has since spread from Venice Beach down to San Diego. Bird plans to branch out to dozens of other markets this year. In Pacific Beach and elsewhere along the San Diego coast, the new mode of transportation played to mostly mixed reviews. “Bird scooters could be a unique opportunity to offer an alternative transportation model, and last-mile commutes that align with our eco-district principles, while mitigating some of Pacific Beach’s parking and traffic issues,” said Sara Berns, executive director of Discover PB, the community’s business improvement district. “However, we want to ensure that the company and its ridership are adhering to public safety concerns, and that of our merchants. “We have reached out to work with the company to help alleviate some of those issues to ensure they are not impeding on our existing business community, but rather enhancing it,” she said. “We look forward to them working with us and the community at- large.” Dan Michaels, a Pacific Beach business owner, turned his thumbs down on the new alternative ride share service. “These new electric scooters for rent all over PB is getting annoying,” said Michaels on the Next Door social media site. “They are leaving them everywhere and [they’re] allowed to operate without a business license. Riders are intoxicated renting them, under age, and don't obey any laws of the road. Then when finished, they are leaving them in front of doors, ramps, etc.” Michaels pointed out Pacific Beach has “fought hard to remove bike share stations (Deco renamed DiscoverBike) from the boardwalk. This company thinks they can just establish these in the same places. What can we do next to stop this before someone gets hurt.” There are numerous rules in the California Vehicle Codes applying to the safe and proper use of electric scooters like Bird. Police warn they will issue citations for a range of violations, costing between $197 and $367, for non-lawful operation of such scooters. Citable scooter offenses include: driving while intoxicated, not having headlights and reflectors at night, not riding on the right-hand edge of roadways, exiting bike lanes without signaling, not having brakes, riders not wearing mandatory bicycle helmets, and not allowing passengers, among other restrictions. When finished, Bird users lock them in place at their end destination. Scooters employ GPS and an electric lock restricting wheel movement. If tampered with, an alarm is triggered on the vehicle locking its wheels in place and making them unridable.

Will bike and scooter shares overpopulate La Jolla?,sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2018,3,10,"Will bike and scooter shares overpopulate La Jolla? The last edition of the La Jolla Village News featured an article about “Bird” Segway Kickscooters, which are seemingly everywhere along the beachfront in Mission and Pacific beaches. The 30- to 40-pound dock-free electric scooters, capable of speeds up to 15 mph, are available through a scooter-share service via a smartphone app. But, with several new app-based dock-free bike share programs, could this sudden propagation present a new DecoBike situation? Begun by Travis VanderZanden, who was previously an executive with Uber and Lyft ride-sharing, Bird Scooters launched in September 2017. The company started in Los Angeles and has since spread from Venice Beach down to San Diego. Bird plans to branch out to dozens of other markets this year.

Not only have Bird Scooters set up shop in PB. But, now, LimeBike, a dock-free, app-driven bike rental business model similar to Bird Scooters, as well as two other providers, have pervaded the landscape. According to a recent press release: “LimeBike brought out its bright green bicycles on Feb. 16, making it the first dock-free bike share business to launch in the City. Soon after, Ofo planned to begin deploying its yellow bikes to share. And, on Feb. 23, Mobike rolls out its signature silver and orange dock-less bikes to locations in San Diego.” LimeBike let bikes loose in LA two years ago, expanding to Imperial Beach and National City last year. Currently available in more than 45 markets, the recent spike in Bird Scooters and bike shares popping up in San Diego has piqued the concern of some La Jolla residents. Halting the ‘invasion’ Despite not being on the agenda for the Feb. 26 meeting of La Jolla Parks and Beaches, Inc., community park planners resoundingly said “no” to dock-free scooters. “How do we stop this invasion of our sidewalks?,” asked Sally Miller of LJPB, whose mission is to preserve, protect and enhance La Jolla parks and beaches. “If we don’t stop this now, we’ll be invaded by every [other] vendor while we’re trying to protect our parks, beaches, sidewalks, and streets. They [riders] can’t just invade us without our permission.” Though bike and scooter sharing were not on the agenda for that meeting, LJPB members felt the topic important enough to vote it onto the agenda as an emergency item. The action then invited other comments by board members. “These scooters are competing with people who have rental bikes,” noted Phyllis Minick. John Shannon said he almost ran into a Bird scooter operator with “no taillights.” “We need to remember that we’re an advisory group for parks and beaches, not roads and streets,” cautioned LJPB president Ann Dynes. Mary Ellen Morgan suggested LJPB ought to consider modifying its policies to address scooter proliferation. “We can only ask the City to stop it,” replied Dynes. “An overall policy with parks and beaches might stop this (scooters) creeping in,” countered Morgan. “This isn’t just about bikes, but about every single vendor who thinks they have the right to throw whatever they want at us on our sidewalks,” concluded Miller. “They didn’t get our permission to come in and raid our town. If we just let any company come in, it will open up a Pandora’s Box, and we’ll have all vendors covering all of our sidewalks.” “It’s much too early (to take a position) on this,” commented Dan Allen. Dynes suggested letting the La Jolla Village Merchants Association “take the lead on this,” as the community organization representing business interests.

"Dockless bikes, scooters are all over San Diego. Here’s how they work.",San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,3,16,"Dockless bikes, scooters are all over San Diego. Here’s how they work. Dockless bikes or station-free ridesharing bicycles have arrived in San Diego County by the droves and they have quickly gained attention — both negative and positive — from residents, business owners and tourists. But do you know what they are? How they work? How many different companies are operating in the region? Do you know if you can ride one on the sidewalk? There are a lot of questions surrounding the new toys on the block, and the answers will vary from company to company. Here’s what we found: How many dockless bikes are in San Diego? It’s unclear how many dockless bikes can be found in total across San Diego County, but there are believed to be roughly 4,000 of them in the city of San Diego alone, according to reporting from the San Diego Reader. What are the dockless bike companies operating in San Diego? There are at least four dockless bike companies operating in San Diego and one selling motorized scooters: LimeBike (bright green and yellow bikes) Mobike (silver and orange bikes) Ofo (yellow and black bikes) Spin (orange and black bikes) Bird (black and white scooters) How do they work? Generally they all use the same, basic concept: You download the app you want. You create an account and link a credit card to it. You scan the QR code on the bike or scooter to unlock it. You ride the vehicle and park it when finished. The timers on the bikes and scooters reset every time they are locked. Each service also provides instructions through its app or website. Here’s how Ofo explains it on its page. How much does it cost to use? Dockless bikes and scooters charge per half hour or an hour. Here’s how those break down: Ofo charges $1 an hour for its dockless bikes, but they are free all of March 2018. Mobike charges $1 for every 30 minutes. LimeBike charges $1 for every 30 minutes. Spin charges $1 for every 30 minutes. Bird charges $1 to unlock a scooter, then 15 cents for every minute of use. Are helmets required? California law requires bicycle riders under 18 to wear a helmet. San Diego and the dockless bicycle companies encourage all riders to wear a helmet at all times, but they don’t provide one. Bird scooter riders must wear a helmet at all times. The company offers free helmets, which users can request through the mobile app. Related: Local laws vary widely on controversial sidewalk bicycling Can I ride on the sidewalk? Electric bicycles and scooters are not allowed on sidewalks. Non-electric bicycles are OK to use on sidewalks in most cities except Escondido, El Cajon, Carlsbad, Vista and National City where sidewalk cycling has been outlawed. Users are limited to one rider per bicycle or scooter. The Downtown San Diego Partnership has more details on what’s allowed and not allowed when using dockless bikes and scooters. What are people saying about it? Opinions on dockless bikes vary widely across San Diego County, depending on who’s talking. While some argue that the availability of dockless bikes and scooters improves transportation choices and ultimately reduces the number of cars on the road, others say there should be better guidance on how to use the bikes, especially when it comes to parking them in a way that doesn’t clog walkways. Opinion: Bike sharing program needed better planning Opinion: Bike sharing benefits city, riders Opinion: How dockless bikes improve transit choices The San Diego Union-Tribune Ideas and Opinion team went into Downtown San Diego Friday to talk to people using the bikes. Here’s what they said. Now it’s your turn — tell us what you think of San Diego’s dockless bikesharing program. Have you used the bikes? Is there anything about them that you don’t like? Do you still have questions about them? ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-dockless-bikes-san-diego-how-do-they-work-20180316-htmlstory.html
"San Diego's Motorized Scooters Are Here to Stay, So Let's Clarify the Rules",Voice of San Diego,,"San Diego, CA",2018,3,20,"San Diego's Motorized Scooters Are Here to Stay, So Let's Clarify the Rules. I don't disagree with the legal opinion that opened the door to our current situation. But I regularly see riders violating state and local laws. Not long ago, motorized scooters began appearing in a variety of places throughout San Diego. They appeared overnight, it seemed, and certainly caused a sensation. They also caused a litany of unlawful activity. Many people are bothered by the fact that these scooters are left in various areas of the city, blocking sidewalks, on people’s private property, and so on. Clearly, the owners of the businesses care little about that. Part of their business model appears to be spreading the scooters far and wide, on city property and wherever else anyone chooses to leave them. The larger problem, though, is that the business model depends upon allowing — encouraging, really — unlawful operation. The California vehicle code states that it is unlawful for the operator of a motorized scooter to do any of the following: • Operate a motorized scooter without wearing a properly fitted and fastened bicycle helmet that meets state standards. • Operate a motorized scooter without a valid driver’s license or instruction permit. • Operate a motorized scooter upon a sidewalk, except as may be necessary to enter or leave adjacent property. • Leave a motorized scooter lying on its side on any sidewalk or park a motorized scooter on a sidewalk in any other position, so that there is not an adequate path for pedestrian traffic. San Diego is clearly aware of these requirements, because the assistant chief operating officer informed the operators of some of the businesses of them in a letter. The San Diego municipal code also states, with respect to parks, “Motorcycles or any other motorized vehicles are prohibited except on roads designated and established for automotive traffic.” In other words, scooters are not allowed on park walkways or boardwalks within parks. It is normal to see these scooters operated by people without helmets, in violation of the California vehicle code. I also regularly see children who don’t look old enough to get a driver’s license on a scooter, apparently provided with one by an adult. And they are commonly operated — unlawfully — on the Mission Beach boardwalk, which has a huge potential impact. We’re in the off-season now, but summer is coming, and police rarely work the boardwalk. How might the owners of these businesses ensure lawful operation? They probably can’t and don’t want to. Since the rentals are done by an app, there’s no one to make sure the renter has a helmet or a driver’s license. Since the scooter is left by the renter wherever they wish, there’s no one to ensure they are parked properly. And so on. Presumably, at some point, the San Diego Police Department will begin enforcing the helmet law, threatening the motorized scooter business model with collapse. After all, how many people walk around with a bicycle helmet in anticipation of renting a scooter? I don’t disagree with City Attorney Mara Elliott, who recently determined that San Diego can allow competing companies, opening the door to our current situation. But it would help if the city provided some clarity on where exactly these scooters can be left and repercussions for the businesses whose clients don’t comply with local and state law. We are at a juncture in our technological advancement in which many businesses are now based on algorithms and apps. They depend upon very low-cost business models in which the cost of paying humans to run the business is minimized, to the benefit of large profits for venture capitalists and business owners, along with fewer jobs. We should embrace technology, but we should hold technologists accountable. ",https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/san-diegos-motorized-scooters-stay-lets-clarify-rules/
"Coronado Declares Dockless Bikes, Scooters Public Nuisance",NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2018,3,21,"Coronado Declares Dockless Bikes, Scooters Public Nuisance. You’ve seen those bright green and yellow bikes you can rent and leave where ever you want. The so-called ""dockless"" bikes have become more popular, and troublesome, in places across the county. The Coronado City Council declared dockless scooters and bikes a public nuisance at a meeting Tuesday night. Dockless ride companies aren't even permitted in the city, but because you can ride and drop them off anywhere, they make their way to the island. City leaders went out and took pictures of unattended bikes and found 48 on Monday alone. On Tuesday the City Manager shared enforcement plans for how police will tag bikes in the public right-of-way with notices to remove property. If they’re not removed within two hours, the public services division will impound them and possibly slap the company with fines upwards of $100 per bike. Some residents are concerned if that's a good use of police resources. “We have service officers,” police captain Laszlo Waczek said. “They do parking enforcement and animal control, primarily. They'll be doing most of the warning notices.” It’s not the concept of transportation rental that Coronadoans are fed up with, it’s that the bikes and scooters are being left like litter on protective beaches, left on lawns and left blocking parking spaces. “If you need a bike rent a bike. It might be $3 difference but it's going to a business, a local business in Coronado and helping us pay our taxes,” one meeting attendee said. Two managers from OFO, the company behind those bright yellow bikes you see around town, addressed the council and said paper warnings on the bikes would make compliance difficult. Instead, they suggested a notice via email or a phone call. OFO said it would work with the ferry company to put the brakes on bikes coming from San Diego to Coronado, and said it is willing to work with both San Diego and Coronado to try and mitigate the problem. The company released a statement Wednesday from Katie Stevens, head of public policy, about the issue. ""At OFO, we strive to empower 'anyone, anywhere' with access to sustainable, convenient and affordable transportation options. We know that the dockless bike share model succeeds when there is close partnership and open dialogue with cities,"" Stevens said. ""We appreciate the City of Coronado's concerns and have already suggested ways in which we can more closely collaborate without requiring the use of public resources. We look forward to continuing to work together."" ",https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/coronado-declares-dockless-bikes-scooters-public-nuisance/162734/
Bird’s electric scooters continue to ruffle feathers,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,5,10,"Bird’s electric scooters continue to ruffle feathers. Dockless electric scooters, which have flooded into San Diego in recent months, could soon be banned from the boardwalk in Mission Beach. City officials said Wednesday they are drafting an emergency ordinance aimed at restricting the motorized vehicles along the boardwalk from Crystal Pier south to the jetty. The effort is being spearheaded by Councilwoman Lorie Zapf and Mayor Kevin Faulconer following a series of collisions between pedestrians and people riding the scooters. “For reasons of public safety on the boardwalk, we need to ensure that we are being diligent and that we don’t have vehicles that are going 15 miles per hour, especially during the summer months,” said Kelly Batten, chief of staff for Zapf. “Lifeguards are now being forced to deal with these issues on the boardwalk, distracting them from the ocean.” The ordinance to restrict the motorized scooters along the boardwalk would need to be approved by the City Council, which is expected to vote on the issue at a regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday, May 22. Dockless bikes and scooters — which can be rented using a smartphone and credit card — have raised safety concerns in San Diego and other cities as riders continue to speed down sidewalks and leave the vehicles strewn in front of businesses and homes. In the last few years, companies, backed by billions of dollars in venture capital, have rolled out thousands of the candy-colored dockless bikes all over the world, from Hong Kong to Paris to Seattle to Southern California. Last Fall, Santa Monica-based company Bird pioneered the market for electric scooters, swooping into Los Angeles and San Diego. Then Bay Area start-up LimeBike started offering its own version of the motorized scooter. Almost immediately, the new electric vehicles were met with both excitement and safety concerns. Under pressure from elected officials, Bird launched a public education campaign about how to use its product responsibly, as well as started giving away free helmets, which are required under state law to ride the motorized vehicles. That hasn’t been enough to alleviate the concerns of many pedestrians who have experienced the scooters whizzing by them at their top speed of 15 miles per hour. Boardwalks in San Diego have a speed limit of 8 miles an hour, and state law prohibits riding motorized scooters on any sidewalk. Police have yet to crack down on people breaking either law.

Zapf moves to ban motorized scooters from boardwalk,sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2018,5,11,"Zapf moves to ban motorized scooters from boardwalk. District 2 Councilmember Lorie Zapf on May 11 announced she will ask the City Council to endorse an emergency ordinance prohibiting motorized scooters on sidewalks and the boardwalk from Crystal Pier in Pacific Beach to the jetty in South Mission Beach. “In the past few months, my office has been inundated by reports from upset residents regarding motorized scooters on the boardwalk,” said Zapf, flanked by interim Lifeguard chief Lt. James Gartland and SDPD Northern Division Capt. Tina Williams, in front of Mission Beach Lifeguard Station. “They say the scooters are going way too fast, causing accidents and making the boardwalk right-of-way dangerous.” Characterizing pedestrians as “obstacles” motorized riders “weave around,” and the boardwalk itself as a “human slalom course,” Zapf read a couple of representative emails calling for action to curb motorized vehicles. “Please get these motorized scooters off the boardwalk, they’re create a serious public safety issue for everyone,” said one email. “Scooters are riding on the boardwalk with no regard for those walking, biking or riding skateboards,” said another email. Interim lifeguard chief, Lt. James Gartland, thanked Zapf for “getting out in front of this,” adding, “Our rescue count goes up five times in June and climbs as well with the crowds through July and August. We have to focus our energy on the water and the beach. The boardwalk will be much safer if you take the motorized scooters off.” Gartland said there has been a distinct “uptick” in accidents, fortunately none serious so far, in the past couple months since motorized scooters appeared on the boardwalk. “We’ve issued 27 citations for running a motorized scooter on a sidewalk, 182 citations for motorized riders without helmets, and issued seven citations for someone riding with a passenger on their scooter,” Capt.Williams said, adding public service announcements will be forthcoming to educate the public on where motorized scooters can and cannot ride legally. “Speed is the main problem,” said Mission Beach Town Council president Gary Wonacott. “We have the summer coming. We know there are going to be a lot more people on the boardwalk. We thank Zapf for this initiative.” “This is a public safety issue,” reiterated Zapf. “We need to take action. My job is to protect the citizens and reduce the liability to the city.” Zapf said she will ask the full City Council May 22 to approve a motorized scooter ban on the boardwalk, as well as asking counsel to clarify what’s legal and what’s not regarding where, and how, motorized scooters can be operated. Zapf said electric carts for the disabled would not be covered in the proposed boardwalk motorized ban.

San Diego City Council Rejects Boardwalk Scooter Ban,kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2018,5,22,"San Diego City Council Rejects Boardwalk Scooter Ban. The San Diego City Council Tuesday rejected an emergency ordinance that would have banned motorized scooters on boardwalks in Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay and La Jolla. State law already bans motorized scooters from sidewalks but doesn't mention boardwalks. The vehicles have become increasingly common in San Diego since they were introduced in February by scooter-sharing companies Bird and LimeBike. Improper usage and excessive speeding has led to injuries, especially where scooters are in close proximity to pedestrians, prompting Councilwoman Lorie Zapf to seek the boardwalk ban. Her proposed emergency ordinance was voted down on a 6-3 vote, with Barbara Bry and Mark Kersey joining Zapf on the losing end. Councilman Chris Ward said a ban was premature, especially considering city and law enforcement officials haven't collected data at each of the locations it would have affected. ""We're being asked today to do something on anecdotal information, and I don't think that's a good basis for policymaking,"" Ward said. Following the failure of the emergency ordinance, a successful motion was made to have the council's Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee look further into the issue. Zapf had already left the chamber before she could cast a vote on the final motion. ""This is not an accident waiting to happen — these accidents have happened,"" she said earlier in the meeting.

City Council votes against boardwalk ban for motorized scooters,sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2018,5,23,"City Council votes against boardwalk ban for motorized scooters. Shock, anger and relief for some was the local reaction to the City Council’s 6-3 vote May 22 against an emergency ordinance prohibiting motorized scooters on coastal boardwalks. District 2 Councilmember Lorie Zapf, who proposed the ordinance, was joined by District 1 Councilmember Barbara Bry and District 5 Councilmember Mark Kersey in supporting a scooter boardwalk ban. Council members Chris Ward, Myrtle Cole, Scott Sherman, Chris Cate, David Alvarez and Georgette Gomez all turned thumbs down on the proposal. They argued either that they weren’t convinced of its necessity, or they felt the issue hadn’t yet been properly vetted. Sherman from District 7 said the problem was more about irresponsible people riding, than about the vehicles being ridden. “I am disappointed that my colleagues failed to realize the tremendous public safety problem electric scooters present on the boardwalk,” said Zapf. “I intend to continue working with the police department, the lifeguard service and community leaders to refine the proposal so that it can gather majority support on the council.” “We won’t be weighing in on the topic,” said San Diego Fire-Rescue spokesperson Monica Munoz. “We enforce the muni codes and other laws when they are enacted.” Asked if the boardwalk is considered a sidewalk, San Diego Police Department spokesperson Lt. Brent Williams, answered: “Some parts are sidewalks and already prohibited. Some parts are a Class 1 bike way. That’s what the item at City Council was about.” Of helmets, Williams said: “They are required for any rider who uses a scooter, age is not a factor. It is enforced and a number of citations have been written for this specific violation citywide.” Concerning enforcement of the 8 mph speed limit on the boardwalk, Williams said: “Scooters do go faster than 8 mph, and 8 mph is the posted limit. Enforcement of this is also done on the boardwalk, and will continue to be enforced by SDPD.” There was considerable agreement from Zapf’s constituency in Mission and Pacific beaches and Mission Bay, that motorized scooters on the boardwalk are a safety threat that needs to be addressed. “I was disgusted,” said Scott Chipman, a 43-year PB resident. “The presentation on safety issues could not have been more convincing showing case after case of dangerous conditions on the boardwalk … Multiple videos of scooter crashes causing injuries were shown. The two City Council members who have beach boardwalks in their districts pleadings were ignored. The recommendations of police and life guard chief were ignored.” Concurred Marcie Beckett, of PB, “Shame on City Council. The bay walk used to be a safe place for families to bring their little kids to ride bikes or roller skate. But not anymore due to the advent of motorized scooters zooming along without the skill or time to react to the unpredictable little ones. The City gets no revenue from the motorized scooter rentals, not even sales tax, but the taxpayers are on the hook for the cost of police enforcement, emergency response and negligence lawsuits from people who will be injured due to the reckless decision made today by City Council.” Citing numerous complaints from his staff and hotel guests, Bill Allen, Crystal Pier Hotel chairman, said: “They are left daily in our hotel driveway locked, blocking our gate access. Guests as well as those walking along the boardwalk now have to dodge riders of these in congested times… The council members who voted against this proposed ban do not represent any coastal areas and, most likely, have not walked on the boardwalk lately.” A counter perspective was offered by Circulate San Diego, a regional nonprofit promoting public and non-motorized travel. “Since the introduction of dockless bike and scooter share earlier this year, San Diegans have begun to use active transportation more than ever before,” said Maya Rosas, the group’s policy director. “Circulate San Diego supports the use of dockless bike and scooter share as a form of transportation and spoke at City Council in opposition to the proposed ban. San Diego has embraced this innovative and green technology. A vote to ban scooters in our iconic boardwalks would have been a step in the wrong direction on the City’s road to get more people walking, biking, scooting, and taking transit.” Said longtime PB community Planner Chris Olson: “Our leaders should support and promote alternative methods of transportation and find safe and effective methods to employ them. This emergency ordinance is a knee-jerk reaction to an important public safety issue, and it is the wrong approach. Yes, some people recklessly speed on scooters, skateboards, bikes, etc. But a blanket ban of motorized scooters on one section of the boardwalk is not a rational solution.” Added Olson: “This ordinance targets a method of transportation rather than the true issue, which is speed. Will they ban electric bikes next? Every time I see people on these scooters they exude gleeful revelation. Don’t take that away.” ",http://www.sdnews.com/view/full_story/27571597/article-City-Council-votes-against-boardwalk-ban-for-motorized-scooters?instance=most_popular1
"Scootering while intoxicated. Yes, it’s a thing and it’s illegal",San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,6,17,"Scootering while intoxicated. Yes, it’s a thing and it’s illegal. If you’ve ever considered trying to save a bit of cash after imbibing with friends by passing on a ride-share service and taking an electric scooter instead — think again. That could be a DUI waiting to happen. “Uber and Lyft are still cheaper than going to jail and being the laughing stock of the cell because you got a DUI-scooter,” said Officer Mark McCullough, who is with the San Diego Police Department’s traffic division. Motorists and motorcyclists aren’t the only ones who can get slapped with drunken driving charges in California. Basically, if you’re inebriated and you’re driving or riding on a “vehicle” of any kind, you could be arrested for DUI, police said. That includes bicycles and scooters — which can now be picked up and rented in cities across the county. On Monday, a 41-year-old man was cited for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol after he rode a rented scooter into the path of a car and was struck in University Heights. He wasn’t wearing a helmet and was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. A motorized scooter doesn’t even have to be on for the rider to get a DUI. In 1977, a state appellate court judge ruled that “if a vehicle, equipped with a motor, is being steered or controlled by an intoxicated person, and the vehicle is in motion, the driver is subject to prosecution even if the engine is not running at that time.” State law says it is illegal for a person age 21 or over to operate a vehicle if that person has a blood-alcohol content that measures .08 percent or higher. However, there’s no minimum blood-alcohol level at which a scooter rider is considered to be intoxicated. In those cases, officers — who must have probable case to make the stop — determine whether riders are impaired. Scooter riders and bicyclists also aren’t at risk of losing their license. When the driver of a car or motorcycle is arrested on DUI charges, officers seize his or her license and hand it over to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, McCullough said. Suspects have 10 days to contact the state agency to determine what comes next, which includes the possibility that the license will be suspended.

Her BMW is now fixed, but she says it's been a frustrating road to get here. Onek captured cellphone video of the suspect running away and reported the hit-and-run to the police. She also contacted Bird through the app and says she hasn't gotten a call back, so she plans to keep the scooter that crashed into her car until the suspect is caught.

She also has a guess at why the suspect didn’t stop. ""I'm just frustrated,"" she tells NBC 7. ""I thought immediately that ‘OK, he's clearly under the influence of something.

Onek has this to say to the person who hit her car: “Be accountable for your actions. Take ownership in what you did and hopefully make smarter choices, be smarter. Ride the Birds if you want to, but make sure you're not intoxicated. Make sure you're not hurting anyone in the process.” Bird's website reads in part: ""Safety is our top priority here at Bird ... That's why we're offering free helmets to all of our riders and making sure all of our riders know the rules of the road.” A company spokesperson sent the following statement to NBC 7: ""We are not in a position to comment on specific incidents. We encourage people to reach us via hello@bird.co."" Onek says something like this could happen to anyone and next time someone could get hurt.

A woman and her 11-year-old daughter visiting from Arizona were seriously injured while riding a motorized scooter on the Mission Beach boardwalk. The accident happened last Friday at the foot of Santa Barbara Place and the boardwalk. The pair was riding double and without a helmet, both of which are illegal. The accident happened just over a month after the San Diego City Council voted against an emergency ordinance that would have banned the motorized scooters on the boardwalk. During the public comment session of Tuesday’s city council meeting, the 11-year old girl’s father criticized the council for voting against the ban. “I am here today because I am highly concerned and upset with this council’s decision to not place an emergency ban on motorized scooters,” said Dan DeWitt. DeWitt says his daughter suffered a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding, as well as a head injury. He says his ex-wife was knocked unconscious in the accident and faces a long recovery after suffering multiple skull fractures. “The beach boardwalk is not the appropriate place for such high-speed, non-regulated, motorized scooters. I plead with you today to reconsider your decision and ban these motorized scooters from your community immediately,” said DeWitt, who lives in Arizona and says he’s been a firefighter for 17-years. Council member Lorie Zapf had proposed the emergency ordinance after receiving numerous complaints and safety concerns about the motorized scooters. “I am saddened to learn of this very serious life threatening scooter accident that happened on the boardwalk involving a child and mother on vacation,” said Zapf in a statement. “My office worked with staff to develop an emergency ordinance to address this issue and unfortunately the City Council majority did not support it. We are now seeing first hand why common-sense rules should be approved, and I urge my council colleagues to revisit this issue on the very clear grounds of protecting public safety,” said Zapf. Council member Scott Sherman, who voted against the ban said he was deeply saddened by the accident, but stood firm on his decision not to ban the motorized scooters. “Pedestrian accidents and casualties that occur while walking, bicycling, or on a scooter happen far too often throughout every part of San Diego, not just the boardwalk. This is why I am committed to the continued implementation of the City’s Vision Zero plan. Before a ban takes place, all options must be researched and analyzed and I urge the motorized scooter companies to work with city officials to find a common sense solution to this serious problem,” said Sherman in a statement. On May 22 when the council voted against the emergency ordinance to ban the motorized scooters on the boardwalk, it agreed to send the issue to a public safety committee for review.

The barrage of candy-colored rental bikes that appeared seemingly overnight in downtown San Diego this spring has faded in recent months. The orange, yellow and green bicycles that seemed to clog every street corner have largely been replaced by a wave of electric scooters, from the city’s urban core to Mission Hills to North Park to Pacific Beach. This week, hundreds of bike-sharing company Ofo’s yellow bikes were spotted piled up at a recycling center in Logan Heights. The company downplayed the situation, saying that selling the bikes for scrap metal was a routine part of operations. Rumors have swirled that Ofo, the world’s first and largest dockless bike company, was leaving San Diego and several other cities for good. Last month, corporate officials said an email blast announcing its departure from a number of metropolitan regions was sent out by mistake. While the company said it plans to stay in San Diego, it has confirmed mass layoffs throughout the U.S. and a retreat from many larger cities, including in Europe. “As we continue to bring bike-share to communities across the globe, Ofo has begun to reevaluate markets that present obstacles to new, green transit solutions …” spokesman Taylor Bennett said in an email. Startup companies offering so-called dockless mobility options grew out of the app-based technology that made ride-sharing companies, such as Lyft and Uber, possible. But in San Diego, and much of Southern California, it’s the motorized scooters that seem to be cornering the market. Users can unlock the scooters and bikes using a phone and then drop them anywhere. The business comes in contrast to the docked model, where users must pick up and return bicycles to a fixed station. Some local advocates for alternative transportation have bemoaned the waning of the dockless bike craze, pointing to the slow pace at which promised bicycle lanes have been rolled out in the region. “It would definitely be going in the wrong direction if we didn’t have shared bikes along with scooters,” said Colin Parent, executive director of the transportation think tank Circulate San Diego. “But I think eventually we’re going to have better bicycle facilities downtown with the right political leadership.” Even if companies such as Ofo and Mobike plan to stay in San Diego, it’s not clear for how long. Mobility companies have been reluctant to share data publicly, such as the number of vehicles deployed in any one area. Dockless scooter and bike company Lime — which changed its name from Lime Bike as scooters gained in popularity — said its electric vehicles have been extremely successful. “We see a lot of people gravitate toward the scooter or electric bikes because they can go to work and not sweat,” said spokeswoman Mary Pruitt. “People are embracing the electric products.” Nikolaj Koster, who flew into San Diego from New York for a work conference, said on Thursday that he’d been riding the scooters all week. “When you’re on them, they’re amazing,” said the 41-year-old. “You’re on a green vehicle and you don’t take up a lot of space. You’re not in a huge car. “You feel like a 12-year-old boy again,” he added. “You look at it and you’re like, ‘I need to try this out.’” Koster and his coworker, Paul Grant, said they didn’t even consider using the dockless bikes, as they cruised on from their hotel in the Gaslamp Quarter to Hillcrest for breakfast Thursday morning. “It’s actually quite fun on the scooters,” said 45-year-old Grant. “It’s new and it’s fresh. Bicycles we’re used to.” At the same time, Ammar Ohan who works downtown said he prefers the bikes because it affords him a bit of exercise on his lunch break, and it’s cheaper than the electric alternative. “You’re burning more calories,” said the 38-year-old. “And this company has an offer for $5 a month. It’s like nothing.” The company that started the dockless electric scooter phenomenon, Bird, is now seeking a $2 billion valuation and is considered the fastest growing startup in history. Lime is racing to catch up, touting a worth of over $1 billion, also in anticipation of going public. However, their success is far from guaranteed. Many cities have taken exception to mobility companies dropping their bikes and scooters on sidewalks without first consulting with officials. In response, cites such as San Francisco and Los Angeles have decided to draft permits that will regulate the industry. The new rules will select operators, charge fees and impose regulations on where the vehicles can operate. Last week, Santa Monica signaled that it was preparing to award its operating contracts to ridesharing companies Lyft and Uber, which earlier this year purchased bike-sharing companies Motivate and Jump, respectively. Lime and Bird shut down operations for a day on Tuesday in protest, following the release of an internal memo from the Santa Monica planning director that outlined the leaders in the competitive bidding process. Bird, which first launched in Santa Monica, declined an interview for this story. The city of San Diego has distinguished itself by declining to regulate the emerging industry. Despite safety and cost concerns by some elected officials, the City Council has repeatedly pushed the issue onto the back burner. The city has yet to release comprehensive data on how many people have been injured in accidents involving the electric scooters, but there have been reports of concussions, broken bones and intoxicated riding.

Dockless Razor scooter rolls into San Diego,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,8,29,"Dockless Razor scooter rolls into San Diego. Razor Scooter rolled into San Diego this month to compete in the growing market for “dockless” mobility options. While dockless bikes seem to be on the wane, scooters have gained in popularity in recent months. Users can unlock the scooters and bikes using a phone and then drop them anywhere. The business comes in contrast to the docked model, where users must pick up and return bicycles to a fixed station. “We are thrilled to be joining this vibrant community,” Danny Simon, CEO for Razor USA, said in a statement. “Our specially designed shared e-scooters create a better shared ride for San Diegans to make the experience convenient, safe, and fun. We are dedicated to continuing to work with the city on how to best be a strong partner for the community.” Razor, which was also launched in Long Beach, will now compete locally with Bay Area startup Lime and Southern California-based Bird. The company that started the dockless electric scooter phenomenon, Bird is now seeking a $2 billion valuation and is considered the fastest growing startup in history. Bird announced Wednesday that it had created a new platform to help cities manage its scooters, including features that would warn riders where they could and could not ride and to report unsafe riding or parking. Lime is racing to catch up, touting a worth of over $1 billion, also in anticipation of going public. Seeing the opportunity for growth, Lyft and Uber are now preparing to launch their own scooter options and also purchased this year bike-sharing companies Motivate and Jump, respectively. To entice users, Razor is offering folks in San Diego three 15-minute rides for free. On Thursday, it is hosting a “pop-up” event and helmet giveaway from 11 am to 1:30 pm at the corner of Harbor Drive and Market Street near the Kansas City Barbeque. The company said its scooters have been “custom designed” to provide a smoother ride, with an inflatable front tire and a wide-deck steel frame. Razor launched its first electric scooter in 2003. As opposed to other scooter companies, Razor touts an in-house maintenance crew to repair and charge the vehicles. Other companies, such as Lime and Bird, use contract workers to perform such functions. The city of San Diego has largely declined to regulate the emerging industry. It has yet to release comprehensive data on how many people have been injured in accidents involving the electric scooters, but there have been reports of concussions, broken bones and intoxicated riding.

San Diego continues hands-off approach as electric scooter injuries mount,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,9,16,"San Diego continues hands-off approach as electric scooter injuries mount. From broken bones and teeth to punctured lungs and lacerations requiring plastic surgery — injuries from riding dockless electric scooters have, according to medical professionals, landed people in emergency rooms all over California. While San Francisco and Los Angeles are rolling out strict rules for start-up scooter companies operating in their jurisdictions, city officials in San Diego haven’t been able to agree on how best to address rising concerns. The City Council has repeatedly brushed aside calls from some elected officials to impose regulations on dockless scooter companies operating locally, including Razor, Lime and Bird. By contrast, pilot programs in Southern California and the Bay Area are instituting fees, collecting ridership data and requiring safety plans from startup scooter companies, which are flush with hundreds of millions of dollars in investor cash. Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s office recently told the Union-Tribune in an emailed statement that the city was looking into “developing a set of rules that focus on rider safety and operator responsibility that will allow for the natural growth of this alternative form of transportation.” However, spokesman Greg Block said the mayor was skeptical about adopting a permitting system similar to those being piloted in other major cities. “We don’t want to do anything that’s going to stop them from doing business here, but we want to figure out ways to make people be more responsible and safe with how they’re riding,” he said. Councilwoman Barbara Bry, who has been calling on Mayor Faulconer and members of the City Council for months to reign in dockless scooter companies, called the city’s current hands-off approach “naive.” “They’re using our streets and illegally using our sidewalks to make money and provide a service that I believe is valuable but needs to be regulated,” she said. “We’re not going to scare them away,” she added. “We are the eighth largest city in the country. We have sunshine every day. We’re a tourist mecca. They’re going to be delighted to pay fees and have money upfront to pay for infrastructure.” Treatment of scooter injuries have been mounting at Scripps Mercy Hospital, said Dr. Vishal Bansal, the hospital’s medical director of trauma. “We’re having these electric scooters that can travel very fast, where there’s no safety restraint, no effort to know if the riders are intoxicated,” he said. “To me that’s a public-health disaster in the making.” Scripps Mercy is now spearheading an effort to collect data on scooter injuries to quantify the issue and get a better sense of the circumstances that lead to the worst accidents, Bansal said. “It’s a serious issue,” he said. “It’s getting worse, not better, and we don’t see any effort to improve safety of these devices in San Diego.” Emergency physicians at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center have launched a similar effort, which ultimately envisions working with law enforcement to collect and catalog detailed injury reports. “We’re creating this huge surveillance database were we link ambulance, police and hospital data all together so that we get as complete a picture as we can,” said Catherine Juillard, trauma surgeon at the hospital. “We don’t want to be divisive about it,” she added. “It’s more about figuring out if there’s some low-hanging fruit in terms of safety that we could implement to make things safer.” In the meantime, San Francisco recently announced it has chosen scooter companies Scoot and Skip for their permit program, in large part because the city approved of proposals by the businesses to improve public safety. Specifically, they have pledged to deploy safety ambassadors and offer in-person training to the public. The companies are also deploying scooters in under-served neighborhoods and offering discounts to low-income users. The program, which is administered by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, is recovering costs through an annual permit fee of $25,000 and a $10,000 endowment. The city of Los Angeles is rolling out similar rules that require all scooters to have a posted notice, in at least 40-point font, telling users not to ride on the sidewalks. The city is also requiring scooter companies to limit vehicle speeds to 15 miles per hour. Companies must pay $20,000 a year for a permit to operate in Los Angeles, and a $130-per-vehicle fee. Operators are also required to maintain a 24-hour hotline for complaints, specifically for improperly parked or broken scooters. In San Diego, where long-promised bike lanes throughout the city have yet to fully materialize, many scooter users have also taken to riding on sidewalks, frustrating business and unnerving pedestrians. However, it’s unclear how, if at all, the city plans to address the situation. The police department has said that ticketing scooter riders is a low priority given limited resources. At the same time, Lime and Bird, according to disclosure reports, have paid local lobbyists tens of thousands of dollars in recent months to meet with the mayor and City Council and, at least in part, oppose regulations that would limit where the scooters could operate. All three scooter companies operating in San Diego, Lime, Bird and Razor declined multiple interview requests for this story. Lime issued this email statement: “Safety is our top priority, which is why we urge riders to practice safe riding not only for their own protection, but also for the safety of the larger community. We also urge riders to wear helmets both through notifications on the app and on the actual scooter.” One of the most vocal opponents of regulating scooter companies has been Councilman Chris Ward — whose District 3 includes some of the areas most popular among scooter riders, from downtown to North Park, Hillcrest and Little Italy. Ward, who also declined interview requests for this story, led the charge against a recently proposed ban on scooters on the boardwalk in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach. Circulate San Diego, a nonprofit that advocates for bicycle safety and public transit, has also taken a dim view of imposing regulations on the new industry. Maya Rosas, advocacy manager with the transportation nonprofit, said that the best way to protect scooter riders and get them off the sidewalk is for the city to follow through on plans to build bicycle lanes. “Building safe travel lanes and removing conflicts between cars and other modes is what saves lives and eliminates risk,” she said. The treasurer of Circulate San Diego’s board of directors, Clarissa Falcon, has been hired by Bird to lobby City Hall. She deferred a request for an interview to her client. Councilman Chris Cate’s office said that it plans to address concerns at the City Council’s Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee on Wednesday. Representatives for scooter companies are scheduled to give presentations and take questions from elected officials.

‘Bird’ announces new safety regulations for electric scooters,Fox5,Fox,"San Diego, CA",2018,9,18,"‘Bird’ announces new safety regulations for electric scooters. City leaders and representatives from the dockless scooter-sharing program 'Bird"" announced new regulations Tuesday to keep riders and community members safe. California State Assemblymember Todd Gloria, San Diego Councilmember Chris Ward, representatives from 'Bird,' and 'Circulate San Diego' came together to unveil Bird's ""GovTech"" platform - a comprehensive set of technologies to better enable the City of San Diego to manage the electric scooters and promote greater public safety. The new public safety measures comes after concerns expressed from the community. ""Bird and dockless sharing technologies like it represent the future of transportation and are giving San Diegans a viable alternative to cars to get around out city,"" said Assemblymember Todd Gloria. ""After engaging in conversations with my constituents, I believe we can do more right now at the local level to not only incorporate and keep pace with this technology, but ensure we preserve public safety at the highest level."" ""Technology made the transportation option possible, and technology can, and must, make the system safer,"" said San Diego City Councilmember Chris Ward. ""The City of San Diego, working with residents and scooter-sharing platforms like Bird, is poised to do more to support mobility options while reclaiming our sidewalks and protecting the safe of user and residents."" Bird's GovTech platform provides initial products such as: Flight Control Dashboard: a comprehensive, customized information system for the City of San Diego to receive insights into Bird usage such as vehicle status and trip data. Geo-fencing: allowing the city to create virtual perimeters and enforce ""no ride"" and ""no parking"" zones. This will ensure Bird scooter riders do not ride in areas they should not, as determined by the city. Geo-fencing can also alert riders on where to find designated parking zones. Community Mode: using the Bird app, anyone will have the ability to report directly to Bird any incidents of unsafe riding, riding on sidewalks, or poor parking. Reports then help Bird Flag riders' policy violations and enable the company to take any actions necessary against repeat offenders. Rider Education: prominent, customizable messages that will be prompted at the beginning of every ride to educate riders about local rules and safe riding practices. The City will be able to request particular, everyday messages such as “no sidewalk riding” as well as date-specific messaging for things such as holidays and events. ""At Bird, we are obsessed with safety,"" said Lys Mendez, senior manager of government partnerships at Bird.

Dockless Scooter Riders Could See 8 MPH Speed Limit Under Proposed Regulations,NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2018,10,22,"Dockless Scooter Riders Could See 8 MPH Speed Limit Under Proposed Regulations. Among the new rules, he is proposing to limit scooter speeds to 8 mph in crowded areas, such as the beach boardwalk, Downtown Embarcadero and the Convention Center. City officials who back a proposed plan to slow down motorized scooters in certain parts of San Diego demonstrated on Monday the difference a few miles can make when it comes to the safety of its riders. Mayor Kevin Faulconer and council members Chris Cate and Lorie Zapf tested a plan to use geofencing to limit the speed of motorized scooters, like Bird, LimeBike and Razor, which have increased in popularity and raised safety concerns. ""We did a demonstration of the boardwalk and showed with my staff the difference between riding at 8 miles and riding at 15 mph,"" Zapf said. ""And just visually you can see that it is a tremendous, tremendous difference and my motive is to keep everyone safe."" The demonstration was held in Liberty Station, one of the seven areas selected as a ""slowdown zone"" for dockless scooters. Other areas include the beach boardwalk, Downtown Embarcadero and the Convention Center. One scooter company, Razor, says they support the proposed dockless scooter regulations. ""We support regulations that will continue to encourage San Diegans to leave their car at home while enhancing rider and pedestrian safety,"" said Brandon Cheung, Government Affairs Manager for Razor, in a written statement. Zapf is urging her fellow council members to consider recommending Faulconer's regulations to the full council at a Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods committee meeting on Wednesday. She said the influx of dockless scooters is causing ""accident after accident."" Within the last week, a 65-year-old woman fractured her leg after losing control of a Bird scooter and two men riding motorized scooters crashed into each other, causing one to fracture his arm. Both accidents happened in downtown San Diego and it was not clear if speed were factors in the crashes. Bird has come up with their own safety measures using geofencing, including creating virtual ""no ride"" and ""no parking"" zones. Their app would also alert users to other safety information, according to the company. Other regulations proposed by Mayor Faulconer last week include more safety education for riders, data sharing and proper liability insurance. Scooter share operators will be required to educate users of local city, state vehicle and traffic codes. They will also be required to provide the city with monthly reports of where the scooters are, how often they are being used and the number of scooters in the city. The report will be used by the city for its Climate Action Plan monitoring and mobility planning.

City Council Committee OKs Dockless Scooter Regulations,Times of San Diego,,"San Diego, CA",2018,10,24,"City Council Committee OKs Dockless Scooter Regulations. The San Diego City Council’s Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee Wednesday voiced support for a suite of proposed regulations on dockless scooters and directed city staff to draft a fleshed-out version. Mayor Kevin Faulconer introduced the proposed regulations Oct. 18 after the city spent months wrestling with how to both ensure public safety and allow dockless scooter companies like Bird, Lime and Razor to continue operating in San Diego. Faulconer’s plan would mandate that scooter companies limit the maximum speed of scooters in high-traffic areas of the city, send monthly data reports to the city detailing things like parking and trip information, educate riders on local traffic laws, and indemnify the city for liability for riders injured within city limits. The companies would also have to obtain an annual permit and pay associated operational fees. “The rapid evolution of this industry is evidence of the popularity of dockless mobility devices as great options for folks who would like to leave their car at home,” Faulconer said when he announced the proposal. “As with many disruptive new technologies, there are issues that need to be addressed. First and foremost, public safety is our top priority and that will be reflected in these common-sense regulations.” According to a spokesman for the mayor, Faulconer’s office intends to have the full proposal back before the council’s Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee in early January. By that time, new council members could be seated in the wake of the November election. Once the committee approves the full regulatory proposal in early 2019, the full council will then consider it. Councilwomen Barbara Bry and Lorie Zapf, who voted along with fellow committee members Chris Cate and Georgette Gomez in support of the concept, expressed concern about each company’s use and sharing of data with third parties. Zapf suggested that the companies are able to keep ride fares cheap because they make large amounts of money from data sharing. Representatives from Bird and Lime flatly denied the claim. Residents voiced their opposition to the scooters at both the committee session and a meeting of the full City Council last month, when representatives from the three companies reported on ways they’re attempting to make the scooters safer to use in busy areas. One part of the proposal by both Faulconer and the scooter companies is using the GPS information on each scooter to limit speeds from 15 mph to 8 mph in areas like Balboa Park, the downtown embarcadero and various boardwalks in Mission Beach, Pacific Beach and La Jolla. This “geofencing” technology has been available for roughly six weeks, according to a Bird spokesman, and is already being implemented on the Santa Monica Beach Bike Path. Zapf proposed a ban on the use of scooters on city boardwalks last spring, but the City Council voted against the proposal, 6-3. Representatives of the public transit advocacy group Circulate San Diego and Razor USA joined Faulconer on Monday to discuss the proposal. “Razor has a proven track record of working with cities to create shared scooter programs that best address their particular needs. Since we launched in San Diego, we have collaborated with the mayor’s office, City Council and city staff to create a great last-mile solution for the city,” said Razor Government Affairs Manager Brandon Cheung. “We support regulations that will continue to encourage San Diegans to leave their car at home while enhancing rider and pedestrian safety.” Zapf and Bry suggested a similar amendment to the proposed regulations during the committee meeting but Cate nixed it, suggesting that there will be time to add amendments at a later date either during a full council meeting or when the proposal returns to committee. Zapf also expressed support for adding larger notifications on the scooters about local and state traffic laws. “I don’t want people to be surprised, we don’t want to ding our tourists,” she said. “I’m not trying to be the fun police, I’m trying to be the safety police and I think there’s definitely a place for scooters … when responsible riders are riding them and they’re going to work and they’re doing the last mile.” Bry said: “We’re already behind in getting something done. You understand the concerns that Councilmember Zapf and I have about their use in certain areas, so I think that needs to be looked at when we reconvene with a fuller framework to look at.” Gomez said a lot of backlash to the scooters is due to riders using sidewalks because of a lack of suitable infrastructure to safely park and ride them on the street. “I cannot stress that we need the infrastructure for safer mobility because it’s not going to get solved by today’s actions,” Gomez said. “I think it’s a step in the right direction, but at the end of the day, if we are not creating paths for people to take, they’re going to take what’s safe.” ",https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2018/10/24/city-council-committee-oks-dockless-scooter-regulations/
"The Mayor's Scooter Regulations Are a Good Start, But Should Go Even Further",Voice of San Diego,,"San Diego, CA",2018,10,24,"The Mayor's Scooter Regulations Are a Good Start, But Should Go Even Further. Here’s how the city can go beyond the mayor’s proposed scooter regulations to ensure equity and safety across communities. Since dockless bikes and electric scooters, now referred to as micro-mobility solutions, began arriving in San Diego in February, my office has received more than 200 complaints. These messages have focused primarily on scooters parked in the public right of way, riders running into pedestrians on sidewalks and scooters thrown into areas where they don’t belong, such as beach cliffs and private property. One of my constituents emailed me in August to say she had been struck from behind outside her office building downtown, and suffered rib, arm and knee injuries. The rider, she said, had no driver’s license and no insurance, and she was left with thousands of dollars in hospital bills. The time for responsible regulation is long overdue. These companies profit by using our public streets and our sidewalks, which is illegal. Before I was elected to the City Council in 2016, I was a high-tech entrepreneur, and I can appreciate that these companies have developed a brilliant business model and have raised hundreds of millions of dollars. I want these innovative micro-mobility solutions to flourish. They have the potential to address first and last mile transit issues, and to help the city plan necessary infrastructure and meet its Climate Action Plan goals. Responsible regulation should address data-sharing (currently, we don’t even know how many scooters are on our streets at any given time and where they travel) as well as education, infrastructure, public safety and equity (to ensure communities that can benefit the most from these affordable transit options are appropriately served). While San Diego has been asleep at the handle bars, other cities like Portland and Santa Monica have issued requests for proposals that include a fee structure, operational standards, data-sharing and insurance requirements. In June, my office presented an informational item to the Budget and Government Efficiency Committee on approaches taken by other cities. Following the committee meeting, I formed a working group with Councilwoman Georgette Gomez. The participants included business, environmental and transit leaders as well as the bike and scooter companies. At the working group’s most recent meeting, my office presented a comprehensive framework that received general approval. I thank the mayor for finally beginning to address this important issue. But I think the city needs to go further, and I am recommending the following. The mayor’s proposal mentions that it will collect fees, but fails to mention how much the city will be collecting and what these fees will be used for. Fees should be used to fund creative educational campaigns and to pay for appropriate infrastructure. This required analysis should be brought through the City Council’s Budget and Government Efficiency Committee. Data should be shared weekly as opposed to monthly, as proposed by the mayor’s framework. I have worked to gain the commitment of the UCSD Hal?c?o?lu Data Science Institute to act as a third-party aggregator of micro-mobility data and to provide comprehensive analyses at no cost to the city. A similar partnership has been implemented by Seattle and the University of Washington. The mayor’s proposal makes no mention of operational and maintenance requirements, including removal and customer service. At our working group, companies claimed that they would be able to submit detailed maintenance and operation plans, which would identify hours of operation, pricing plans, helmet distribution strategies, etc. The mayor’s plan is silent on equity requirements. A complete and thoughtfully formed framework must ensure micro-mobility options are accessible to all communities of concern. This includes flexible and alternative payment plans and minimum fleet requirements in equity focus areas. Education initiatives should go beyond in-app notifications of laws and warnings on the physical vehicle. The city should work with providers to strategize on educational campaigns regarding safe riding and responsible parking. What’s clear is that if the city fails to pass responsible regulations, these micro-mobility options are not only going to crash into people, they are going to continue to crash into our city, leaving more than a few bruises behind in its path.

"Injured scooter riders line up to sue Bird and Lime, but ‘user agreements’ could shield companies",San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2018,11,5,"Injured scooter riders line up to sue Bird and Lime, but ‘user agreements’ could shield companies. Pat Brogan had already picked up considerable speed on a Lime scooter riding downhill on Laurel Street when she said she realized the brakes weren’t working. “I thought I was going to die for sure,” said the 63-year-old Bay Area resident who was visiting family in San Diego. Approaching a red light at a busy intersection, she said she laid the scooter down to avoid riding into traffic, skidding for about ten feet before coming to a stop. The crash broke two bones in her right hand, which required surgery, fractured a knuckle and badly bruised up her leg. The incident, which happened in August, set her back roughly $8,000 in out-of-pocket medical expenses. “They publish that the (scooter’s) max speed is 15 miles an hour, but that has nothing to do with a hill,” she said. “Now I don’t have the full use of either hand.” Brogan is one of a growing number of people looking to hold scooter companies, such as Bird and Lime, legally responsible for injuries involving their electric devices. Her attorney Catherine Lerer with McGee, Lerer & Associates filed a class action lawsuit against the scooter companies Lime and Bird last month alleging, among other things, “products liability and gross negligence, as well as aiding and abetting assault.” “They’re not street worthy,” Lerer said. “They’re not safe for their intended purpose.” The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks damages on behalf of nine plaintiffs, including pedestrians hit by scooter riders. The suit alleges even scooters that aren’t malfunctioning are not properly designed for urban landscapes and too easily get out of control. Brogan, however, isn’t part of that lawsuit. Hers is one of another two dozen cases the law firm is now pursuing separately based largely on malfunctions from failed brakes to stuck throttles. One client Vicky Leptien said she had to jump off a scooter after the vehicle started speeding out of control in Balboa Park. “I had a choice of getting hit by a car or jumping,” said the 58-year-old. “I did a tuck and roll and broke my arm. I had to have a plate and screws.” Scooter companies Lime, Bird and Razor declined interviews for this story, including questions about how frequently their scooters are maintained and the qualifications of their mechanics. Lime recently recalled 2,000 scooters from San Diego, Los Angeles and Lake Tahoe due to concerns about exploding batteries. In response to the Union-Tribune’s inquiry, Bird released a statement that read in part: “At Bird, safety is our very top priority, and it drives our mission to get cars off the road to make cities safer and more livable. Bird is committed to partnering with San Diego to ensure that the community, and its visitors, safely use our affordable, environmentally friendly transportation option.” Since start-up scooter companies first deployed thousands of so-called dockless rental scooters in Southern California about a year ago, injuries have been mounting across the country. Public health officials have raised concerns in recent months as riders of the electric vehicles continue to crash into pedestrians, potholes and cars, often with serious consequences — including a handful of deaths. So far scooter companies such as Lime and Bird — now valued in the billions — have avoided having to take legal responsibility for such accidents. That’s largely because scooter companies require riders to agree to a lengthy legal contract through their smart-phone apps before renting a device. “I’m familiar with the waiver and that waiver is pretty extensive,” said Mike Bomberger, a personal injury attorney with the San Diego-based Estey & Bomberger. “Unless the scooter itself malfunctions you have a difficult case against the dockless scooter companies.” Lerer said that she initially was turning down scooter injury cases because the user agreements so thoroughly limit legal liability for the scooter companies. “I think attorneys are reluctant to take these cases,” she said. “I was too, but the calls are just never ending, and they’re heartbreaking. Someone’s got to go against these companies.” Shortly after she filed the class-action lawsuit, both Lime and Bird updated their user agreements. For example, Lime’s now includes this wording: “Important notice: This agreement is subject to binding arbitration and a waiver of class action rights …” At the same time, several lawsuits have been filed in San Diego Superior Court against Bird, including one in the past few weeks that also named the city of San Diego as a defendant. City Attorney Mara Elliot’s office — which has been tasked with drafting rules to indemnify the city from liability in scooter accidents — declined several interview requests for this story. After months of public outcry, the city recently announced it would draft rules for scooter companies, including limiting speeds in specific areas. Draft regulations are expected in early 2019. Local attorneys said that scooter riders could file a claim against the city if they are injured as a result of poorly maintained streets. However, some personal injury lawyers noted that pedestrians may also have a case if they trip over one of the thousands of scooters that now cover downtown San Diego. If a pedestrian is hit by a someone on a scooter, the rider’s homeowner or rental insurance can in many cases cover the injured person. According to a public records disclosure no claims have been filed against the city involving dockless scooters as of early September. City officials declined to provide any further details. Beyond the onerous user agreements, many lawyers agreed, cases against scooter companies could be hard to prove. The scooters are often left at the scene, meaning there’s no physical evidence of a scooter being defective. And most notably, a plaintiff would likely have to prove that the injury was the result of scooter and not user error — even if the device malfunctioned. “I think it’s going to be pretty simple that they’re inherently dangerous and there’s a design defect, but the fight will be on was that a substantial factor in the harm,” said attorney Jim Brown of the San Diego-based JB Law. However, if a class-action lawsuit goes to a jury trial it could “devastate” the industry, he said. “The big analysis is going to depend on the public view of this.” Jeffery Lee Costell with Costell & Cornelius Law Corporation, who has teamed up with Lerer to file the class action suit in Los Angeles, said their goal is not to shut down the scooter industry. “We’re not trying to stamp out scooters and presume whether we know if they have a place in the urban landscape,” he said. “We just want to make them safer.” Jarrett Charo, a personal injury lawyer with Thorsnes Bartolotta McGuire, said he thinks some of the cases could eventually prove successful despite the tightly written user agreements. “Generally, there’s a trend in the courts that realizes these terms of service are overreaching and is becoming less receptive to validating them,” he said. However, he said his office has yet to take up a case, largely because of the legal hurdles created by the waivers. “We looked at a potential class action and reviewed their terms of service,” he said. “Their terms of service are onerous.” ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/transportation/sd-me-dockless-scooter-lawsuits-20181105-story.html
"Dockless Scooter Company Adds Geofencing, Report Feature as Safety Measures",NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2018,11,19,"Dockless Scooter Company Adds Geofencing, Report Feature as Safety Measures. In an effort to remedy one of their biggest complaints, the dockless scooter company, Bird, has announced new safety measures for riders in San Diego. Representatives for Bird were joined by Assemblymember Todd Gloria and San Diego City Councilmember Chris Ward to share updates to the app that allow customers to report incidents and safety hazards. Bird's feature is part of the company's ""GovTech"" platform that aims to work with the city to address residents' concerns. ""A middle ground would be fantastic that way people can still ride them. It's a new idea; it's making a lot of money but safety is a big concern, and also convenience and courtesy."" Tierrasanta resident Luke Fallon said. Geofencing within the app will allow the city of San Diego to create virtual no-ride and no-parking zones, which can alert riders when they are in areas they should not be in. The app will also create an information system that the city can use to receive insight into rider's usage, like the status of the scooter and trip data. Bird will also prompt app users with information on how to safely use the scooters and city-specific rules. The city can request particular messages for users as well. Although the dockless scooters have caused concern for some residents, others are optimistic about their opportunity. ""Change is hard, change is absolutely difficult and I know a lot of folks may want to see a ban, but I think the majority of folks want sensible regulations that will keep them and the riders safe,"" Gloria said. In June, an electric scooter crash on the Mission Beach boardwalk left a mother and her 11-year-old daughter seriously injured. The girl suffered a ruptured spleen and a head injury. The accident happened just over a month after the San Diego City Council voted against an emergency ordinance that would have banned motorized scooters on the boardwalk. Right now it is mandatory to wear a helmet when riding electric scooters, but that could soon change with new legislation. A bill passed in August would allow adults to ride motorized scooters without a helmet in California. The bill now awaits Governor Jerry Brown's signature to become state law. Bird backed the proposal. The scooter company does provide free helmets to customers who request one as an in-app option. Riders just need to pay a shipping fee. While Tuesday's announcement only included Bird, Gloria hopes other dockless scooter companies like LimeBike and Razor will come up with their own safety features. The announcement came a day before Bird and other dockless scooter companies, including LimeBike and Razor, were scheduled to present the steps they are taking to address public safety concerns to the San Diego City Council. The council's public safety committee has been working with the companies for months to address public safety concerns, which will be discussed at Wednesday's city council meeting.

Local Business Picks Up Scooters From Private Property For Free,NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2019,1,21,"Local Business Picks Up Scooters From Private Property For Free. The company has a phone number anyone can call 24/7. While scooters and dockless bicycles have changed the transportation industry in San Diego, some business owners and residents don't like the look of them on their properties. A new local service, called Scooter Removal, LLC., is hoping to serve those customers by removing the unwanted scooters and bikes, free of charge. ""They're doing a service to the community,"" said Jonathan Freeman, who lives in the Gaslamp District. ""They're getting more scooters off the streets."" Freeman said he has not felt safe walking downtown ever since a scooter crashed into his blind dog. ""A scooter came up behind us and hit his head,"" said Freeman. ""If he would've hit his body, it would've killed him."" The app caters to property owners in San Diego of businesses and homes. They can also call the number on the website to have a truck pick up Lime and Bird Scooters, as well as dockless bicycles. The company says that they remove unwanted scooters and bikes 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The removal service usually arrives within 30 minutes of the call. The company invoices the scooter and bicycle company and sends a notice to pick them up at their facility. The owners of Scooter Removal added customers and pedestrians can trip over scooters on the property of a business owner, which can lead to liability. ""We help to set up 'no parking zones' if you register with us,"" said Dan Borelli, Co-Owner of Scooter Removal, LLC. ""We put up signs on the property and alert the company that a private property owner has created a zone."" Companies like Bird and Lime then must inform their users that they have parked in a 'no parking zone.' If nothing is done, Scooter Removal will remove the item from the property. ""It's our service to the community,"" added Borelli. ""We're not anti-scooter, we're just helping to clean up the city."" Scooter Removal also adds that scooter removal will improve access to the business by removing obstructions that block customer access. The company said they developed the service from a need to help clean up the community and protect business and home owners. In two weeks, the company will fully launch an app, called Scoot Scoop, for Androids and iPhones. ",https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/local-business/1899/
Revenge of the businesses: Thousands of scooters towed and held for ransom,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2019,1,29,"Revenge of the businesses: Thousands of scooters towed and held for ransom. As scooters continue to colonize San Diego’s streets — blocking parking garages, walkways and encroaching onto private property — locals are beginning to fight back. While some residents have resorted to vandalism (tossing scooters into dumpsters and lakes), two businessmen in Pacific Beach are offering an alternative way to get rid of errant scooters. They pick them up for free and charge scooter companies — Bird, Lime, Jump and Lyft — to get their property back. The two entrepreneurs — Dan Borelli and John Heinkel — launched a business called Scooter Removal LLC earlier this month, responding to the constant complaints of their neighbors that electric scooters and e-bikes were crowding into privately owned spaces. “We don’t want them gone,” Heinkel said. “We just want a check and balance.” Borelli has had a front row seat to the scooter invasion. He’s a co-owner of Boardwalk Electric Rides, which sells and rents electric skateboards, scooters and other items on the Pacific Beach promenade. It’s here that Bay Area scooter companies have deployed their products en masse, targeting tourists and locals alike. Borelli says it didn’t hurt his business — in fact his sales number have gone up since the dockless trend took hold — but his neighbors were frustrated by the clutter. Then one day, Heinkel walked into his shop and asked Borelli a question: “How do you deal with this junk in front of your shop every day?” Heinkel, who owns a local tow truck company, ended up negotiating a deal with Borelli and other property owners in the same complex to patrol the business area regularly, impounding scooters and e-bikes that were parked illegally on private property. Within weeks, Heinkel had impounded thousands of dockless bikes and scooters, and the duo realized the demand for scooter removal was bigger than they thought. When innovation meets the impound lot They launched Scooter Removal in January, and have collected an additional 1,000 bikes and scooters since incorporating. They’re even developing a mobile app called Scoot Scoop, which lets users report illegally parked scooters and bikes, and book a free removal service. Scoot Scoop isn’t live yet, but Heinkel said they’ll have it up as soon as possible. Until then, people can call to request pickup, sign a tow authorization on the spot, and the company will remove the items for free. Borelli said they’ve recovered scooters in some pretty odd places, including the rooftops of privately owned homes, garbage cans and even underneath parked cars. “People run over them while parking, and then just leave them under their cars,” Borelli said. Their biggest hauls are from business plazas downtown and in beach communities, where business owners have asked Scooter Removal to clear their property regularly. Borelli said the response from the community has been overwhelming. They’re getting calls from frustrated residents daily, including residents of other cities. He even received a call from a public official working at the city of Atlanta, who said the city is in need of a removal service, too. Scooter Removal is hiring more developers to build out their software, so they can license out the technology to other tow truck companies, Borelli said. Scooter companies respond … or don’t Borelli said most of the dockless companies have been slow to react to their property being impounded. Jump, which is owned by Uber, has been the most responsive, he said. “They sent a whole team of people down here to meet with us, including their lawyer,” Borelli said. “But they respect private property and they want to do things right. They pay their bill and retrieve their property every day.” The other dockless companies? Not so much. Borelli said impounded scooters and bikes are piling up in their Pacific Beach warehouse. If the companies don’t retrieve their property, Scooter Removal will likely auction off the items. Borelli said he’s working with his attorney on that, and plans to have their first auction in a couple of weeks. The U-T requested comment from Bird, Lyft, Uber, and Lime. Only Lime responded in time for print, warning residents to be careful. “Whether it’s a bike or scooter, micromobility has long been part of San Diego’s commitment to reducing traffic and clean air,” the statement reads. “The community should be careful when engaging with pop-up companies claiming to provide city services like impounding or towing. Impounding bikes or scooters requires compliance with the law, and Lime is in the process of reviewing whether these pop-ups are committing violations which may subject them to liability. Interfering with consumer access to transportation services or disrupting a ride in progress impacts all San Diegans.” The better option? Lime says contact them directly at support@limebike.com. The dockless companies all have ways for residents to report illegally parked scooters and e-bikes, by the way. But that requires residents to contact each company individually, which can sometimes be a hassle. Heinkel said he believes the dockless companies are littering by allowing their bikes and scooters to end up on private property. But right now, it’s kind of a gray area, as the city is still developing new rules around dockless mobility options. “They’re operating where no law exists — they built their whole business in this gray area,” Heinkel said. “There’s no clear definition of whether the scooter falls under the vehicle code. We’re trying to hammer out the process moving forward.” All parties are consulting their attorneys. What does it cost? While the service is free for those who request it, Scooter Removal makes its money from the dockless companies themselves. Just like with impounded vehicles, the companies have to pay a fee to get their property back. Borelli wouldn’t disclose exactly how much they’re charging, but said they modeled their rates after the City of Coronado’s system, as the city also impounds bikes and scooters. Under Coronado’s rules, the companies have to pay a $45 impound fee and a $1-per-day storage fee to pick up their bicycles. Borelli stressed that the company will not remove scooters and bikes unless they are parked on — or touching — private property, are blocking storefronts or driveways. The company can be reached at 858-262-1912. ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/technology/sd-fi-scoot-scoop-tow-scooters-20190129-story.html
Mayor proposes new regulations for scooters and bikes,sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2019,2,15,"Mayor proposes new regulations for scooters and bikes. On Feb. 14, Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer released a set of proposed regulations for dockless scooters and bicycles to address public safety concerns by slowing the devices down in heavily-trafficked public spaces, establish clear rules of the road to hold operators accountable, and charge an annual fee for each device. The proposed ordinance will be discussed at the City Council’s Feb. 20 Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee meeting. Faulconer’s proposed regulations cover six primary areas – limiting maximum speed of motorized scooters in designated zones, vehicle staging and parking, rider education, data sharing, fees and legal indemnification for the City of San Diego. The mayor’s proposed regulations include: Permit and fees: Each company wishing to operate within City limits will be issued a six-month permit and will be required to pay $150 per device annually. Operators will only be allowed to amend or renew their permit, including increasing the size of their fleet, during the permit issuance months of January and June. Companies offering an approved equity program can receive a $15 per device reduction in their annual fee. Operators will also be required to pay a “performance bond,” which can be returned in the event they cease operation in San Diego and remove their devices. Limiting speed: Using geofencing technology, operators will be required to slow their devices down to eight miles per hour in designated high-pedestrian traffic zones around the City, including: - Boardwalks in Mission Beach, Pacific Beach and La Jolla beach areas; - Spanish Landing; - Petco Park; - Balboa Park; - NTC Park; - Mission Bay Park. In two other areas in downtown San Diego, scooters will be required to slow to three miles per hour, with riders being notified they are in a no-ride zone. Those areas are: - North and South Embarcadero; - Martin Luther King Jr. Promenade. Staging and parking: Operators may stage their devices in groups of up to four, and there must be 40 feet between groups of staged devices. They will also be prohibited from staging in school zones and hospital zones. Additionally, users will be prohibited from ending their rides in some areas, including the beach area boardwalks, the perimeter of Petco Park and the north and south Embarcadero walks in downtown. The City will encourage residents to report misplaced or abandoned bikes and scooters through the “Get It Done” application. Operators will be notified of the reports and will have three hours to remove the devices or face potential impound and associated fees. City indemnification: Each operator will be required to indemnify the City from liability claims and each will need to hold a liability insurance policy. Rider education: Prior to each use, companies will be required to educate riders of local and state vehicle and traffic codes and the cost of a citation for violating those laws. Each device also will need to be clearly labeled “Riding on Sidewalks is Prohibited” and include operator age requirements. “The City of San Diego is taking a smart approach to dockless mobility,” said Colin Parent, executive director of Circulate San Diego. “San Diego is ensuring access to new transportation choices, while balancing the needs of other users of the public right-of-way.” Data sharing: The operators will provide the City with detailed monthly reports that will be useful for Climate Action Plan monitoring and mobility planning, including but not limited to: - Deployed Device Data, including fleet size and utilization rates; - Trip information, including start/end points, routes, distances and duration; - Parking information; - Reported incidents and actions taken; - Reported obstructions/hazards and actions taken; - Maintenance activities. “We welcome more mobility options and these new regulations take a common-sense approach that will allow this emerging market to grow in a responsible way,” Faulconer said. “Scooters and e-bikes are providing an opportunity for thousands of people to get around town without a car, creating less traffic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.” “I am pleased to see the City adopt sensible regulations for dockless scooters and bicycles that prioritizes public safety and embraces the sharing economy,” said City Councilmember Chris Cate. “Resolving this issue has been one of my top priorities, and I am appreciative that my solutions will be implemented.” ",http://www.sdnews.com/view/full_story/27628287/article-Mayor-proposes-new-regulations-for-scooters-and-bikes-?instance=most_popular1
Disability Lawsuit Targets San Diego Over Dockless Scooters,kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2019,2,19,"Disability Lawsuit Targets San Diego Over Dockless Scooters. As the San Diego City Council begins debating regulations for motorized scooters this week, the city is also preparing to respond to a lawsuit claiming the new devices have caused discrimination against people with disabilities. The lawsuit, which was filed in a federal district court last month and seeks to be a class action, claims both the city and scooter rental companies Lime, Bird and Razor have failed to prevent people from riding or parking scooters on sidewalks. Scooters have blocked people with disabilities from accessing the public right-of-way, the plaintiffs claim, and have turned sidewalks into a ""vehicle highway"" where pedestrians are at risk of injury. ""People with disabilities who wish to travel in the City using the City's walkways are being forced to either put their physical safety at risk or just stay home,"" the complaint reads. ""This is not a choice that they should have to make."" The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting scooters from being parked or operated on sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps and other walkways. Scooters started showing up in San Diego and cities across the country roughly a year ago. Complaints about the devices came just as swiftly, and some cities have banned private rental companies from placing scooters on their streets and sidewalks. San Diego has taken a far more cautious approach to scooter regulations, with some city leaders warning that reacting too hastily could cause the city to miss out on their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most of which come from cars and trucks. Mayor Kevin Faulconer's proposed regulations would, among other things, require scooter rental companies to automatically reduce speeds in certain high-pedestrian areas. Alex Montoya, one of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, was born missing his right leg and both his arms. He uses prosthetic limbs and said he chose to live in the East Village because it was easier for him to get around without a car. Montoya said since the arrival of scooters downtown, he has had to remain hypervigilant to avoid getting knocked down by scooter riders, most of whom he observes riding on the sidewalk. ""It's really such a scary endeavor,"" he said. ""Because of my prosthetic leg, I can't get out of the way as quickly."" Riding motorized scooters on sidewalks is illegal under California law, as is parking them — or any other object — in such a way that blocks pedestrian or disabled access to public walkways. Montoya said he has not seen those laws well enforced downtown. San Diego Police Department data show there were 551 citations issued to people for riding a scooter on the sidewalk in 2018. Police issued more than four times as many citations to people riding without a helmet — something that is no longer illegal for people 18 and older. Sophie Wolfram, director of programs at the nonprofit Climate Action Campaign, said it is unacceptable that people with disabilities fear for their safety because of scooters. She said people's tendency to ride on sidewalks shows how unsafe they feel sharing a lane with cars. Plans for protected bike lanes downtown and throughout the region have faced numerous delays. ""It's not fair to ask people to risk their necks every time they want to make a trip on a scooter by riding in traffic,"" Wolfram said. ""So there's a lot that the city can do and needs to do to build protected space that makes it safe for scooters. And when the city does that ... it also makes it safer for pedestrians to reclaim the sidewalk for slower uses."" Wolfram added that much of the criticism of scooters — that they are nuisances, eyesores or safety hazards — can easily be applied to cars, as well. ""I think one way that the disruption scooters have brought has been useful is that they have exposed some biases we have about how we should move around our city, and what kinds of mobility devices we accept having strewn about our city,"" she said. The San Diego City Attorney's Office said it would respond to the complaint through the courts. Bird and Razor could not be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Lime said the company has invested $3 million in a safety education campaign, frequently gives away free helmets and employs a team of on-the-ground responders to move illegally parked scooters. Montoya said he was encouraged by the mayor's willingness to regulated scooters, and that he understands their appeal as an alternative to cars. ""I think the scooters are a great invention,"" Montoya said. ""But I think if they are here to stay, they need to be really regulate in a way that's safe for everyone.""

Remember those guys impounding scooters? Lime and Bird are suing them,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2019,4,10,"Remember those guys impounding scooters? Lime and Bird are suing them. Dockless scooter giants Bird and Lime are suing two San Diego businessmen for impounding thousands of their electronic bikes and scooters, then holding the property hostage until a “ransom” was paid. The local towing company, Scooter Removal, was founded earlier this year by entrepreneurs Dan Borelli and John Heinkel. The two say they were responding to constant complaints from business owners and neighbors frustrated that electric scooters and e-bikes were crowding into privately owned spaces. The towing company allows people to call and request a pickup, sign a tow authorization on the spot, and Scooter Removal will remove the items for free, later charging the scooter companies to get their property back. “We don’t want them gone,” Heinkel told the Union-Tribune in February. “We just want a check and balance.” But Bird and Lime allege the towing company is breaking the law in order to profit from the tech companies. Among several allegations, the two companies say Scooter Removal is violating California vehicle code, interfering with personal property and committing civil theft. “In an attempt to improperly capitalize on Lime’s service to the San Diego community, defendants have developed an unlawful scheme of illegally impounding bikes and e-scooters ... and demanding ransom for their return,” Lime’s complaint reads. Borelli said Scooter Removal and related parties are denying all allegations and plan to countersue. The local company is represented by Neil Dymott Attorneys, a downtown firm also involved in a separate legal action against dockless companies for endangering people with disabilities on city sidewalks. Bird and Lime’s allegations Although Bird and Lime filed two separate legal actions against Scooter Removal, the complaints are strikingly similar and were filed one day apart. According to the legal documents, Scooter Removal has 2,500 Bird scooters locked away in a warehouse and is demanding “tens of thousands of dollars” for their return. The company said it already paid $40,000 to the towing company in November 2018 to retrieve 1,800 of its scooters. In Lime’s complaint, the company said Scooter Removal has 1,300 scooters and 285 bikes in locked storage, demanding $50,000 from Lime for their return. Through the lawsuit, Lime is hoping the court will stop Scooter Removal’s actions through injunctive relief, along with awarding Lime compensation to cover legal fees and other damages. Bird is asking for the return of its property, an award of “four times the towing and storage fees defendants have charged Bird,” along with an award to Bird of “any profits” made by Scooter Removal due to “their unlawful business.” A Bird spokesperson said San Diego residents are “being bamboozled” by Scooter Removal and “robbing people of the environmentally friendly scooter options they’ve come to rely upon each day to get to and from work, as well as to local businesses.” Lime declined to comment. Both scooter companies have features on their apps that allow people to report improperly parked scooters and bikes. Scooter Removal’s response Borelli said the claims made by Bird and Lime are “false and very inaccurate.” He said the billion-dollar tech giants were out of line, putting their business on other people’s property without permission. “They litter and make property owners liable for injury lawsuits like the city now faces from scooter trips and falls,” Borelli said. One allegation against Scooter Removal is that the company didn’t adequately inform Bird and Lime of each impounded scooter individually, as required by vehicle law. Instead, the towing company sent batch emails notifying the company of several impounded scooters at once. Borelli said the towing company is a “small mom and pop shop trying to remove these nuisances with signed agent agreements on behalf of owners, notifying companies before, during and after removal.” “They want to bully us to shut us down and use private property without recourse,” he said. Borelli said Scooter Removal is still operating and plans on expanding soon.

San Diego approves rules for electric scooters as angry residents crowd City Hall,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2019,4,23,"San Diego approves rules for electric scooters as angry residents crowd City Hall. The San Diego City Council approved on Tuesday long-awaited rules for governing the app-rented bike and scooter companies that over the last year have flooded city streets with the motorized vehicles. Following several hours of heated testimony from community members, the City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that establishes a permitting process for operators, limits speeds in designated areas and requires all devices to scan a valid driver’s license before they can be used. The new rules go into effect in June, after the council takes its final vote. Mayor Kevin Faulconer, whose office drafted the rules, has embraced the technology as a way to implement the city’s Climate Action Plan, which calls for thousands of people to abandon their car commutes in favor of cleaner alternatives. Faulconer did not attend the meeting but released this statement following the vote: “The way people get around town has changed quite a bit, and we’re embracing that by putting in place common-sense rules to protect the quality of life in our neighborhoods.” Scores of residents showed up to the meeting to voice concerns about the growing number of people who have been injured while riding the electric scooters, especially downtown and along the boardwalk. “Our Mission Beach boardwalk as become a highway of safety violations, from double riders and minors to double riding minors,” said Sarah Mattinson, 40. “The sheer number of children on the scooter is alarming. Is this child endangerment?” Representatives from the scooter companies, such as Bird and Lime, also attended the meeting, bringing with them dozens of their employees and freelance workers. “I can honestly tell you that there’s nothing more that this company wants for the public than to have a safe and green alternative for people to use in our city,” said Jacob Swett, a 37-year-old mechanic for Bird who lives in North Park. “I work hard every day to make sure that these scooters are safe.” Amber Rivera, a City Heights resident who works as a full-time employee with Lime suggested that riders are at fault in many accidents. “Those scooters are amazing,” said the 38-year-old. “They’re built well. They’re stable. I think people should think about what they’re doing when they ride the scooters.” At the same time, disabled residents, including many in wheelchairs, voiced frustration about navigating city sidewalks strewn with the dockless devices. “I used to be able to go anywhere downtown,” said Phil Pressel, an 81-year-old resident of downtown who uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. “Now I cannot do it without my wife accompanying me because the scooter are blocking my way, and I can’t move them.” Disability Rights California filed a lawsuit in January against the city, Bird, Lime and Razor for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. The national nonprofit has claimed the city has failed to keep the public right-of-way safe for disabled residents. “I trip over 20 to 30 a day,” said Ali Faraj, 40, who is nearly blind and lives downtown. “You’re regulations are good and a step in the right direction but I request of you today to ban them on sidewalks completely.” To help address these concerns, the city has started painting parking corrals — 6 by 10 foot rectangles — in the street next to curbs in downtown. Parking dockless vehicles on sidewalks along blocks with corrals is prohibited under the rules. The city plans to install more than 300 of them in downtown and then expand the project to beach communities. Representatives with the scooter companies said they supported the new rules, but repeatedly asked the city to lower permitting fees and reconsider restrictions on parking. “We do have a concern with the staging mandate, with any staging mandate that’s limited to a fixed number of corrals,” said Katie Stevens, senior director of strategic development for Lime. “We believe it could prevent operators from placing vehicles in high need areas as other operators fill the corrals upon staging.” Residents will be able to report parking and other violations using the city’s “Get It Done” app. More information can be found at sandiego.gov/get-it-done. Companies will have three hours to retrieve the vehicles or risk having them impounded. The police department said it’s applying for grants to fund overtime for officers to enforce the rules. Members of the City Council reassured the public that the new rules were just the beginning of what would be an ongoing process to regulate dockless vehicle operators. “We will stay vigilant on this,” said Councilman Chris Cate. “We will work with our partners on this, but this is something that I would love for us to continue to evaluate and pursue additional changes if need be.” City Councilman Mark Kersey said he was particularly interested in figuring out ways to ensure that all devices were kept off sidewalks to help the disabled. “I’m not just concerned about the city getting sued,” he said. “I’m really concerned about doing the right thing.” Councilwoman Barbara Bry — who has led the charge to demand the city draft regulations — called for reviving a proposed ban on all dockless mobility devices along the boardwalk. “Last summer, I did support an emergency ban on the boardwalks,” she said. “I think the situation is even worse.” Kersey and Councilwoman Jennifer Campbell also said they would support a ban if it came before council. “These devices are a threat to our public health for riders and walkers,” Campbell said. “I hear from health officials and community members almost daily about the negligence and bodily harm induced by these devices. Just last night, a woman on Pacific Highway broke her leg falling off a scooter.” Since the devices showed up early last year, elected officials and the police department have been barraged with hundreds of emails from concerned, often angry residents, calling on the city to address the situation and crack down on those who ride the electric vehicles on sidewalks. New rules for dockless bike and scooter companies (Goes into effect in June) Speed and parking restrictions: Companies will be required to limit vehicle speeds, using geofencing technology, in designated zones: Areas with a speed limit of 8 mph include the public walkways within Balboa Park, Liberty Station NTC Park and Spanish Landing Park and Trail. Areas with a speed limit of 8 mph, where a device cannot be locked and parked include the public walkway on Ocean Front Walk in Mission Beach through Ocean Boulevard in Pacific Beach, Mission Bay Walk along the west side of Mission Bay Park and the walkway on the east side of the park. Restrictions also apply to the boardwalk from Avenida De La Playa along La Jolla Shores and the public right-of-way within Petco Ballpark Zone. Areas with a speed limit of 3 mph, where a device cannot be locked and parked include Martin Luther King Jr. Promenade, the pedestrian walks along North and South Embarcedero and West Date Street between India and Columbia streets, known as Piazza della Famiglia. Those working for dockless bike and scooter companies must stage the vehicles in groups of no more than four and at least 40 feet apart in the downtown and beach communities. They cannot be left in parking zones for the disabled or within 500 feet of hospitals and schools governed by the state education code. They also cannot be left within six feet of bus or trolley stop. Whenever possible vehicles must be parked in city-provided parking corrals — rectangular, painted boxes near street curbs. The vehicles cannot be parked on streets adjacent to those with the off-sidewalk corrals. Education: Companies are required to force riders to scroll through and manually acknowledge local and state vehicle laws before each ride. All motorized scooters will include a label that reads: “Riding on sidewalks is prohibited.” Impounding: Companies must retrieve their vehicles from city property within three hours of being notified that devices are inoperable, not safe to operate or improperly parked. Vehicles not picked up within the timeframe can be impounded at a company’s expense of $65 per device and $1 a day. The city manager can suspend a company’s right to operate for six months or more based on violations of any of the city’s rules. Residents can report violations using the city’s “Get It Done” app. More information can be found at sandiego.gov/get-it-done. Fees: Companies are required to secure a six-month permit at a cost of $5,141 in January and July, as well as pay $150 per device annually. Operators can adjust the size of their vehicle fleets when they renew their permits. Once a year, they can apply for an event permit to increase the size of their fleets up to 20 percent for 10 days. Operators can qualify for a $15 reduction in the vehicle fee, at the discretion of the city manager, by implementing programs for low-income riders. Legal indemnification: Companies must shield the city from any liability, claims and damage related to their business. Operators will be required to hold commercial general liability insurance of $2 million per occurrence and $4 million aggregate. Each operator will also carry a $4 million umbrella policy. Data sharing: Companies must share anonymized data on a regular basis, such as fleet sizes, how often devices are used, trips and parking locations, accidents and maintenance. The city manager can also require operators to conduct user surveys and provide data in real time.

"It’s official, City’s new scooter regulations to start July 1",sdnews.com,San Diego Community Newspaper Group,"San Diego, CA",2019,5,14,"It’s official, City’s new scooter regulations to start July 1. On May 14, the City Council unanimously approved the new electric scooter regulations, which will go into effect July 1. The new rules will decrease the allowable speed of electric scooters from 15 to 8 mph on the boardwalk, and to 3 mph in high-traffic areas with the use of geofencing technology. Scooters are to be banned from parking near hospitals, schools, near Petco Park, and on the boardwalk. Electric scooters and bikes are prohibited from riding on city sidewalks. Key components of the regulations include: ·Speed limits: In specific geofenced areas, operators will slow scooters to 8 mph. Three of the geofenced areas are pedestrian-only and operators will slow scooters to 3 mph with a push message notifying riders to leave that area. ·Geofencing will be in effect for beach-area boardwalks, Balboa Park, NTC Park, Mission Bay Park, Petco Park and the pedestrian-only locations, including North/South Embarcadero, MLK Jr. Promenade, and La Piazza della Famiglia. ·Staging: Operators will no longer be able to stage scooters and e-bikes on sidewalks in downtown. The City has identified – and is currently installing – 330 on-street dockless parking corrals throughout downtown where staging is allowed. ·In the beach areas, operators are only permitted to stage in groups of up to four, with 40 feet in between each group. The City will identify corral locations in the beach areas and, once installed, will require their use.The City also will conduct an evaluation of locations throughout San Diego where designated parking corrals would be beneficial and, working with the City Council and communities, install more. ·Rider parking: Operators will prohibit riders from ending a ride in specific geofenced areas, including beach area boardwalks. ·Education: Consistent messages about local and state laws in smartphone applications will be required. As will on-device labeling about age requirements and how riding on the sidewalk is illegal. ·Per device fee: A per device fee of $150 annually will be assessed. A reduction of $15 per device will be offered for operators offering a qualified equity program. ·Equity programs may include discounts, equitable distribution, credit-card free unlock or mobile-device free unlock. ·Data sharing: A variety of data will be shared about ridership, parking, paths of travel and more to assist the City in transportation planning, Climate Action Plan reporting and enforcement. ·Indemnification/insurance: Operators will be required to indemnify the City from liability and to hold a $2 million per occurrence, $4 million aggregate and $4 million umbrella insurance policy. ·Performance bond: Each operator will be required to pay a “Safety Deposit” – $65 for each device in fleet – to be held in the event the company leaves the market without its devices. The ordinance will charge dockless companies an annual $150 per-device fee. The City noted that should act as a de facto cap on scooter numbers. “If we could do a rewind, I would have banned this entire thing from the city from the start without regulation,” District 2 Councilmember Dr. Jen Campbell said previously. District 1 Councilmember Barbara Bry said she plans to propose an ordinance to ban electric scooters from the boardwalk.

"San Diego Impounds 2,500 Scooters Over Comic-Con Weekend",NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2019,7,22,"San Diego Impounds 2,500 Scooters Over Comic-Con Weekend. The city of San Diego impounded approximately 2,500 dockless scooters and bicycles over the weekend of Comic-Con 2019. NBC 7 captured video of the rentals Monday after they had been corralled by city crews. Crews say the scooters and bicycles were presenting public safety hazards because riders were parking them in areas that blocked sidewalks, walkways, and ramps. “We don’t want anyone to get hurt,” Operational Excellence Program Manager Barbara Lamb said. “If these things are left scattered about they are at least a tripping hazard.” The fine for each of confiscated rental bike or scooter is $65. The hope is that the fee will encourage the device companies to be more proactive about enforcing the rules, according to a city spokesperson. “We had our whole team down there trying to pick up as many as we can. We’re glad the city was there to help us out,” LIME General Manager Kimia Talebian. “There was so much volume of riders coming into the city, that when they were parking, there was just to many of them, so it was best to pull them off the street,"" she added. LIME representatives told NBC 7 they feature in-app messaging and safety workshops for riders to educate them on the rules. Eight city employees used trucks and earned overtime pay to collect the rentals over the weekend, while three more workers stayed at the maintenance yard to organize them. Though the city stands to collect $163,150 in impound fees, Lamb said the city isn't going to make a profit from the operation. “The purpose of the fee is to cover the city expenses and not to make a profit. We are definitely not making a profit,” said Lamb. There are several corrals painted at intersections specifically for parking scooters and bikes. Companies renting dockless vehicles are required to renew permits every six months, a city spokesperson told NBC 7 earlier this month. If a company doesn't comply, they won't be doing business in town. Here’s the breakdown of the scooters and bikes that were impounded by company, according to the city: Bird – 1,035 Lime – 684 Lyft – 444 Jump – 41 Skip – 28 Spin – 17 ",https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/scooters-impounded-san-diego-comic-con-day-after/131836/
San Diego Looking To Oust Lime Scooters,kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2019,8,20,"San Diego Looking To Oust Lime Scooters. The city of San Diego is putting the brakes on Lime electric scooters by starting the process of revoking the company’s permit to operate in the city. ""We’re going to hold people accountable,"" said San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. ""Look, we’ve established very clear rules of the road when it comes to scooters and I absolutely expect those rules to be followed by every single company."" New rules that went into effect last month require companies to use technology called ""geofencing"" to limit speeds in certain areas like Mission Beach. The city said Lime has violated these new rules at least three times. Company officials say the city is mistaken. ""I have reassured them that we are compliant and we’re working to demonstrate to the city that we are,"" said Lime General Manager Kimia Talebian. Talebian said the company reached out to city officials for an explanation but have not reached nor heard back. She said the news has left employees confused. ""We employ about 130 full-time staff not to mention about 3,000 gig-economy workers that are on a weekly basis coming to us — they rely on us for income,"" she said. ""Waking up to news like that — it’s not pleasant."" There are at least five scooter companies in San Diego and the city would not say if it is looking to revoke any other permits — but it expects all companies to obey the rules. ""I think you’ve seen most of the companies comply — that’s exactly what we want — but we’re going to hold everyone accountable,"" Faulconer said. ""And that’s very clear and I’m going to continue to be very clear about it."" Lime said it is fulfilling an important community need, claiming that 3 million people in San Diego have taken rides on its scooters. ""People take these to work — these are people who can’t afford cars — they can’t afford Uber,"" Talebian said. ""We’re here to fill that gap."" Next month a code enforcement hearing will determine if Lime scooters stay or go. Lime will keep it’s operating permit while it goes through this process. If it loses the hearing, the company would have to wait at least six months before applying for another permit. ",https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/aug/20/san-diego-trying-kick-out-scooter-company-lime/
"New study reveals skyrocketing injuries, intoxicated e-scooter riders",ABC 10,ABC,"San Diego, CA",2019,8,30,"New study reveals skyrocketing injuries, intoxicated e-scooter riders. In Pacific Beach, it's common to see scooters in the flow of traffic. At night, it's the same story. Firefighters plagued with trauma patients from scooter crashes. Crews say they often see people using them to bar hop. A study released Thursday reveals data supporting exactly that. The study focuses on 103 patients and after tests it shows that half of them were drunk. Even more surprising, 52% were high on drugs. The study pulled data from UCSD Medical Center, Scripps Mercy Medical Center, and a hospital in Austin, Texas. ""We were concerned this would become the next big public health issue,"" says UC San Diego Health Dr. Leslie Kobayashi. The study looked at patients between September 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018. ""Spinal fractures and spinal chord injuries,"" Kobayashi says, recalling injuries. ""I myself saw one patient who was not able to be salvaged because of a severe overwhelming devastating head injury."" Kobayashi seeing the skyrocketing trend from the emergency room. New rules started in June to combat these stats, like limiting the speed of scooters in places like the boardwalk and forcing riders to park scooters in corrals. Firefighters in Pacific Beach say they're seeing less injuries in the last month. Kobayashi hopes it's just the beginning. ""Reducing the speeds, limiting the times of day it can be used, and whether or not protective gear, most importantly helmets are going to have an impact on injury prevention,"" Kobayashi added. The conclusion of the study reads, ""eScooter-related trauma has significantly increased over time. Alcohol and illicit substance use among these patients was common, and helmet use was extremely rare. Significant injuries including intracranial hemorrhage and fractures requiring operative intervention were present in over half (51%) of patients. Interventions aimed at increasing helmet use and discouraging eScooter operation while intoxicated are necessary to reduce the burden of eScooter-related trauma."" 10News reached out to Bird and Lime for a response. Lime said they are ""piloting a new function in the app - “Don’t drink and ride” - whereby those trying to rent a Lime after 10pm now have to confirm they are not attempting to rider under the influence."" Both companies said safety is their priority. Bird sent us this statement, in part, ""The rules of the road, apply to everyone — whether behind the wheel, walking, cycling or on a scooter. We go to great lengths to educate and inform riders about the dangers of distracted riding, including riding under the influence, as well as educating them on how to identify drivers who might be operating cars under the influence."" They provide in-app messages and emails reminding riders not to drink and ride.

Scooter Impound Company Sues Lime Over Fight With Scooter ‘Juicers',NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2019,9,6,"Scooter Impound Company Sues Lime Over Fight With Scooter ‘Juicers'. ""Juicers"" are people who collect motorized scooters and charge them for anywhere between $3 and $10 per device. The owners of a San Diego company that impounds electric rideshare scooters parked on private property are suing a popular scooter operating company. Legal action was taken against Lime Scooters after the owners of Scoot Scoop said they got into a violent confrontation with so-called “juicers” working on behalf of Lime. Juicers are people who collect motorized scooters and charge them for anywhere between $3 and $10 per device. According to the lawsuit, the business owners found two unidentified men allegedly breaking into a storage facility near Crystal Pier in Pacific Beach where Scoot Scoop stores impounded scooters. When the owners confronted the men, a fight broke out. “Punches were thrown. The gentleman was a large, big dirty beast and he picked up scooters and was throwing them like King Kong,” said Scoot Scoop owner John Heinkel. Heinkel, who has been in the repo business for 25 years, started Scoot Scoop with business partner Dan Borelli. “These guys from Lime have been told to go and get these scooters by any means necessary, whether it’s to break locks, whether it’s to jump a fence, whether it’s to confront somebody, push them to the ground and take the scooter,” said Borelli. Borelli said he suffered a knee and ankle injury in the fight. Heinkel said he suffered a scratched cornea and still gets headaches from the incident. The San Diego Police Department said a police report was taken. However, no suspects have been identified. Lime Scooter responded to the lawsuit with a statement, via email, to NBC 7: “While we can’t comment on active litigation, this is a disturbing report and such aggressive behavior is never tolerated on the Lime platform. Anyone found violating our community guidelines are immediately removed,” said Lime spokesperson Alex Youn. Scoot Scoop has impounded more than 12,000 scooters, according to Borelli. The company charges $50 and a $2 storage fee to return the devices. Lime is critical of the company, and calls the charges a ransom. A Lime spokesperson said they’ve attempted to engage Scoot Scoop in good faith to resolve the issue, but after unsuccessful attempts Lime was forced to file a lawsuit of its own. The company will not comment on active litigation. Meanwhile, there’s also a question of whether “juicers” are actual employees of Lime. The company said they are independent actors and have no control over them. However, the attorney for Scoot Scoop owners disagrees, saying Lime controls their actions and therefore are responsible for their behavior. The lawsuit is seeking damages for negligence, assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

"Uber Pulling Fleet Of Dockless Bikes, Scooters From San Diego Market",kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2019,9,12,"Uber Pulling Fleet Of Dockless Bikes, Scooters From San Diego Market. Uber will pull its fleet of Jump bicycles and electric scooters from San Diego city streets starting Sept. 19, the company announced Thursday. The company will, however, continue to operate on Naval Base San Diego and Naval Base Point Loma. Uber says city regulations made it too difficult to operate in San Diego. “We agree with local elected officials in San Diego who’ve said current micromobility regulations foster an unsustainable operating environment, which is why we’re ending our operations as of today,” Uber spokesman Nick Smith said. “We look forward to working with the city to develop more sensible regulations.” Uber notified the city on Monday and notified its users on Thursday about the change. San Diego passed a slew of regulations for dockless bike and scooter companies in April, including speed and parking restrictions in certain areas as well as permitting fees and data-sharing requirements. In July, San Diego City Councilwoman Barbara Bry called for a temporary ban on dockless scooters. She said the scooters are safety hazards and the city's current regulations are too loose. Christina Chadwick, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the rules imposed by the city were put in place for public safety and to protect San Diego’s quality of life. “We appreciate scooter operators who take these regulations seriously and who have made compliance a priority,” Chadwick said. Since dockless bikes and scooters started operating in the city more than a year ago, residents have complained about them clogging sidewalks. Several people have been injured or killed while using scooters. Meantime, competitor Lime Bikes is battling the city to continue operating in San Diego. In August, San Diego threatened to boot Lime out for allegedly violating the speed limit rule in designated areas. Officials for Lime said the company has since resolved the issue. Lime can continue to operate in the city pending a hearing. Uber says it hopes to return to San Diego in the future.

How green are dockless e-scooters?,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2019,11,4,"How green are dockless e-scooters? Study finds dockless e-scooters more eco-friendly than driving, but buses, biking and walking remain the greenest travel options. Dockless e-scooter companies have for roughly two years touted their devices as not only convenient but a win for the environment. However, a growing body of research suggests that the ongoing scooter craze may not be as green as advertised. To change that, experts say companies — such as Lime, Bird and Wheels — must manufacture more robust e-scooters while riders need to increasingly use those devices in lieu of driving. According to studies, many people are currently cruising around on e-scooters as an alternative to cleaner forms of transportation, such as biking, walking and taking the bus. Still, experts say the fast-evolving industry has the potential to revolutionize urban travel and significantly reduce planet-warming emissions. “It could be huge for sustainable travel,” said Juan Matute, deputy director of UCLA’s Institute of Transportation Studies, who is scheduled to testify before the Legislature on Monday regarding the state of the micro-mobility industry. “When they launched, things were relatively inefficient and messy,” he added. “Now they’re trying to work out some of those kinks, like having vehicles that last longer, but also expanding the vehicle types they offer.” Some local elected leaders, who are facing increasing pressure from the state to curb vehicle emissions, have also promoted the scooters as environmentally friendly. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, for example, has called the devices “game changers” that can help the city realize its ambitious Climate Action Plan goals. At a recent public hearing in San Diego, Katie Stevens, director of government relations for Lime, told members of the City Council that scooters were encouraging people to forego driving — downplaying the technology’s potential to replace bicycle and walking trips. “E-scooter are the mode that are successfully getting people out of cars,” she said, adding: “This is an additional segment of the population that’s doesn’t utilize active transportation.” Data starting to emerge from cities around the country seems to contradict that testimony. About 40 percent of scooter rides have replaced biking or walking trips in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, according to recent municipal surveys. A survey from Paris was even more grim, finding that 85 percent of scooter rides replaced either walking, biking or public transit trips. Lime signaled that it would share with the Union-Tribune a survey about how San Diegans have been using scooters, but ultimately declined to do so. User polls have also found that on average about a third of scooter trips are replacing car trips, including a sizable 41 percent of the time in San Francisco. Lime said that figure is 35 percent in San Diego. Given how people are using the devices, the carbon footprint of scooters is very low, but not a net gain for the environment as some companies have suggested, according to a scientific study published in August from North Carolina State University. “It looks like an increase in environmental impacts … because about half of the scooter rides are displacing walking and riding bikes,” said Jeremiah Johnson, a researcher at the university, who co-authored the report. “If you are one of the riders who is displacing a car ride, you are almost certainly reducing your environmental emissions.” The study, the first of its kind, measured the greenhouse-gas emissions per mile for a dockless shared e-scooter and then compared that against the the average car, bus and bicycle. The lifecycle analysis for scooters took into account emissions created by everything from manufacturing to shipping to disposal to the gas burned while workers drive around searching for scooters to charge and repair. According to the findings, more than 90 percent of emissions were from building the devices and shuttling them around by car. That means that making the scooters last longer would go a long way toward shrinking their carbon footprint, Johnson said. “These are changes that are quite feasible,” he said. “Extending the scooter lifetime, improving the efficiency of the collection and distribution system, those are achievable things. They don’t require new technology. They don’t require enormous changes in the system.” In fact, companies have been rolling out new, more robust scooters on a regular basis. Bird and Lime now claim their most recent models last more than a year on average. For comparison, the North Carolina study used a median lifespan of 15 months for its analysis. While the industry has been tight lipped about the durability of their earlier devices, research suggests they lasted somewhere between a month to six months on average. It makes sense for scooter companies to invest in devices that log more miles before being scrapped for parts, said Andrew Savage, vice president of sustainability for Lime. “There is a strong business case and environmental case for scooters lasting longer,” he said. “It’s something that we as a company have spent an enormous amount of effort with continuous improvement on.” Another improvement that some companies are exploring is moving away from the free-for-all collection systems that employ gig-economy workers to compete with each other at the end of the day to scoop up as many devices as possible. The model may provide cheap labor for scooter companies, but it creates a lot of needless driving, according to experts. In response, some scooter companies, such as the Ford-owned Spin, have started employing workers to round up scooters that need charging and maintenance. This costs more but allows companies to more efficiently deploy their collection fleets. Spin has also been experimenting with charging stations in places such as Chicago, Tampa and Washington, D.C. “We believe charging stations can make our operations more eco-friendly, in that they’ll limit the number of trips our drivers need to make to pick up and charge scooters,” said company spokeswoman Maria Buczkowski. “Eventually these stations will be retrofitted with solar panels.” Along the same lines, Lime officials said its company is trying out a new model that allows its freelance drivers to reserve scooters for collection using its app. The result, they hope, will be a better experience for the workers and fewer tailpipe emissions. Some transportation researchers have questioned whether such tweaks to the scooter industry will lead to any significant environmental gains. While shrinking the carbon footprint of a device may improve a company’s image, that doesn’t guarantee it will lead to large cuts in greenhouse gas. “Even if it can have lasting effects on daily travel, unless they connect to transit, the actual vehicle miles that are substituted are just miniscule,” said Dillon Fitch, a researcher who studies travel patterns and commuter behavior at UC Davis. “It’s just a drop in the bucket.” Still, Fitch said the dockless bikes and scooters that have flooded city streets around the country may psychologically impact those who routinely drive. “The big benefit that could be realized by scooter shares are just changing people’s decision processes,” he said. “Just the idea that someone could stop and think before they jump in the car and consider something else, I think is a huge win.” At the same time, the scooter craze may be kicking off an interest in personal ownership of such devices, experts said. This could also increasingly impact how people think about getting around urban landscapes. If micro mobility continues to evolve and gain in popularity, it will raise a host of questions for public officials. The demand for bike lanes could, for example, dramatically increase, and many such pathways may have to be redesigned for vehicles that travel different speeds. Because the industry is being supported by billions in venture capital, there’s also the chance that it could collapse overnight. It’s far from clear whether public enthusiasm for the devices will translate into profits if companies eventually go public. That could be especially challenging in cities without comprehensive bike-lane networks, such as in San Diego. The city recently reported that it saw a 50 percent decline in scooter ridership since this summer, raising questions about the future of the industry.

"Lime Scooters Aren’t Going Anywhere, City Loses Battle To Revoke Operating Permit",kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2019,12,6,"Lime Scooters Aren’t Going Anywhere, City Loses Battle To Revoke Operating Permit. Lime scooters are here to stay in San Diego, at least for now. A city of San Diego administrative hearing officer has decided that, in trying to revoke Lime's permit to operate, city officials did not give proper notice of alleged geofencing violations to Lime or prove that the scooter company failed to comply with geofencing requirements. The decision came down earlier this week. “Lime is pleased with the decision and we appreciate the hearing officer for recognizing our compliance in San Diego,"" said Lime spokesman Alex Youn. ""As San Diego’s longest serving operator, we value our partnership with the city and look forward to continuing to serve the community.” In certain areas of the city, like near the beach, scooter companies are required to limit speeds, which is done with technology called geofencing. In August city officials notified Lime it was seeking to revoke it's permit to operate for violating those speed restrictions. The hearing officer said the city's notice to Lime had ""the absence of any meaningful facts"" and that the city needed to provide more information to Lime other than telling the company it was in violation of ""geofencing speed and operating restrictions."" The hearing officer concluded Lime was not given enough information to fix the alleged problem and the company was denied due process. The city released a statement on the decision, focusing on making streets and sidewalks safe. “We respect the decision and look forward to adopting enhanced scooter regulations — which have already been presented to committee — that give the city even more tools to enforce public safety laws and keep our streets and sidewalks safe,"" a city of San Diego spokesman said in a statement. The hearing officer said the city's evidence against lime was insufficient. The city used a San Diego Police detective taking laser measurements to record multiple speed violations — but the hearing officer found the detective had never used the laser on scooters, the laser was only certified at 35 mph and higher (scooters were recorded going less than 20 mph) and the laser was not tested to ensure accuracy before the investigation. There was also insufficient evidence to show the detective observed violations inside geofenced areas. The hearing officer also concluded that evidence collected from compliance testing was insufficient. None of the city's testers had code compliance in their job descriptions, staff determined non-compliance by looking at scooter speedometers and did not check the accuracy of the speedometers, and evidence provided by Lime showed portions of the tests took place outside of geofenced areas. Lime was also relieved of paying $841 in administrative costs. The decision can be appealed, but the city has indicated it will not. Read the full hearing decision below.

San Diego City Council Bans Electric Scooters On Boardwalks,kpbs,PBS,"San Diego, CA",2019,12,16,"San Diego City Council Bans Electric Scooters On Boardwalks. The San Diego City Council voted 5-4 Monday to approve a prohibition of electric scooters on the city's boardwalks. The ordinance would ban the use of motorized vehicles, not including motorized wheelchairs, on the Mission Beach and Pacific Beach boardwalks, Mission Bay Park Bayside Walk and the La Jolla Shores Boardwalk. The council also voted in favor of an amendment to the city's existing regulations of dockless motorized vehicles to reduce speed limits on the boardwalks from 8 mph to 3 mph. Councilwomen Barbara Bry and Jennifer Campbell, who represent much of the city's coastal neighborhoods, favored the ban. They argued that the boardwalks are Class I bike paths, meaning only pedestrians, bicyclists and people using non-motorized forms of transportation are allowed to use them. ""In the beach areas, there are physical streets and alleyways that can be used if someone indeed needs to travel on a motorized scooter for a transportation option,"" Bry said. But opponents of the ban said pushing scooter riders to adjacent streets would make people even less safe because those streets have no bike lanes. ""I am severely nervous that by doing so we are going to shift more individuals onto Mission Boulevard,"" said Councilman Chris Ward. ""And then you all of a sudden have conflict with automobiles, and that's where the deaths occur."" Ward also criticized the ordinance going straight to council and circumventing the committee process, where council members could have discussed the proposal and modified it if necessary. Councilman Scott Sherman argued that the regulations have already led to a decline in collisions and other accidents involving scooters and motorized vehicles. ""We need to finally just decide: is the boardwalk for pedestrians, or is it a bike path or what is it?"" Sherman said. ""Because that's really I think at the heart of the issue here and not coming up with a ban and trying to jump to a ban really quickly when we've only seen regulations in place for six months and we're starting to see good numbers from those regulations."" Sherman and Ward were joined by Council President Georgette Gomez and Councilman Chris Cate in opposing the ban. Council members Monica Montgomery, Mark Kersey and Vivian Moreno voted with Bry and Campbell in favor of the ban. At least one death — that of a 48-year-old man in June — was caused by a dockless scooter collision on the Mission Beach Boardwalk. That death occurred prior to the enforcement of the city's regulations, which went into effect July 1 and limited scooter speed limits on the boardwalk to 8 mph. The council first approved the regulatory package for dockless scooters and other similar vehicles in April, more than a year after scooter companies like Bird and Lime made the devices ubiquitous around the city. At the time of that vote, Bry and Campbell called for a full ban on scooter and motorized vehicle use on municipal boardwalks. The amendment package ultimately only included speed limits in high trafficked areas such as the boardwalks, Embarcadero and Spanish Landing. Bry has made the conflicts surrounding motorized a central issue in her campaign for mayor. In July, she called for a citywide moratorium on dockless scooters due to safety concerns and the city's impoundment of a large swath of devices during Comic-Con weekend. Last month, the council's Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved a set of additions to the regulatory ordinance, including a rider curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. and increased measures designed to keep residents without a valid government ID from operating a dockless scooter or other similar device. The full council is expected to consider the amendments in early 2020. The council is expected to hold a second, ratifying vote on the boardwalk ban in January. Unless at least one member of the council changes their vote from a ""no"" to a ""yes,"" the ordinance would not have a veto-proof majority. Mayor Kevin Faulconer supported a motorized scooter ban on the boardwalks in 2018, but the council at the time rejected the proposal 6-3.

Electric scooter injuries surge along with their popularity,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2020,1,8,"Electric scooter injuries surge along with their popularity. Electric scooter injuries have surged along with their popularity in the United States, nearly tripling over four years, researchers said in a study published Wednesday. Nearly 40,000 broken bones, head injuries, cuts and bruises resulting from scooter accidents were treated in U.S. emergency rooms from 2014 through 2018, the research showed. The scooter injury rate among the general U.S. population climbed from 6 per 100,000 to 19 per 100,000. Most occurred in riders aged 18 to 34, and most injured riders weren’t hospitalized. For the study published in JAMA Surgery, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed U.S. government data on nonfatal injuries treated in emergency rooms. “Improved rider safety measures and regulation” are clearly needed, the researchers said. Media reports have linked the stand-up electric scooters with more than a dozen U.S. deaths within the past few years. The trend follows the emergence of rental companies in cities around the world that let customers rent scooters through smartphone apps and drop them off anywhere in the same city. Some cities have adopted nighttime bans and other restrictions amid rising injuries and complaints about scooters traveling or parked on sidewalks. “Scooters promote active commuting,” could help spur wider public transit use and could lead to less traffic congestion, said lead author Dr. Benjamin Breyer. “We hope to raise awareness that riders should wear helmets and ride safely.” ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/nation/story/2020-01-08/electric-scooter-injuries-surge-along-with-their-popularity
"Dockless scooter giant, Lime, is leaving San Diego. Here’s why",San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2020,1,9,"Dockless scooter giant, Lime, is leaving San Diego. Here’s why. Just weeks after San Diego City Council banned e-scooters from popular beach spots, one of the biggest players in the industry is withdrawing from the market altogether. Lime, which was the first e-scooter operator to launch in San Diego in early 2018, is pulling all 4,500 of its scooters from the city, which started Thursday. They will join Uber’s Jump and San Francisco-based Skip, which both recently exited San Diego complaining about city regulations. Lime is citing too much red tape, declining ridership and a need to cut costs. “As part of our path to profitability, Lime has made the difficult decision to exit San Diego and focus our resources on markets that allow us to meet our ambitious goals for 2020,” said Brad Bao, co-founder and CEO of Lime, in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the partnership we’ve enjoyed with San Diego and remain hopeful we can reintroduce Lime back into the community when the time is right.” San Diego is not alone in this Lime retreat. The company is also exiting 11 other markets and laying off 14 percent of its workers (about 100 people). In the U.S., Lime is leaving Atlanta, Phoenix, San Diego and San Antonio. But the company still operates in 120 markets worldwide. A Lime spokesperson said the company has faced a series of hurdles in San Diego, which together have prompted Lime to exit. For up-and-coming scooter companies, San Diego was once one of the hottest cities to enter. The region’s year-round good weather, highly populated tourist spots and hands-off government made it a prime destination. In a matter of months, the city’s downtown and beach areas were overrun with electric bikes and scooters on every corner. The devices began encroaching on public and private spots, pushing a local towing company to start impounding errant scooters. Meanwhile, scooter injuries and concerns over safety inspired passionate critics to organize and make their complaints known to city leaders. San Diego, some feared, had become a Wild West of dockless equipment. When the New York Times did a story on the topic, it carried this headline: “Welcome to San Diego. Don’t Mind the Scooters.” And when Seattle started considering its own regulation for scooters, they sent a TV station crew here for a “what not to do” piece. Local government responded. Last summer, the city rolled out new regulations on scooter companies, instituting speed limits in popular tourist areas and rules on where scooters can be staged, among other changes. The new rules were followed by a sharp decline in all e-scooter ridership citywide. From July to December, the number of trips using shared-mobility devices dropped by 75 percent — with rides taken over a two-week time frame going from 441,830 down to 110,009, according to data provided by the city. It was unclear whether the rules impacted the dropoff in ridership, or if the decline was more tied to seasonality. Then last month, the San Diego City Council took it a step further, banning all e-scooters and e-bikes from the boardwalk from Mission Beach to La Jolla. For Lime, this move""significantly impacted ridership” in San Diego, the company’s spokesperson said. Scott Robinson, a senior public information officer at the City of San Diego, provided the Union-Tribune with the following statement: “We respect Lime’s business decision, and remain committed to supporting this emerging industry as a low-cost, environmentally-friendly transportation option,” Robinson wrote in an email. “San Diego’s top priority is public safety, and in order for this industry to succeed doing business on our streets, compliance with regulations that hold operators accountable and prioritizes rider safety will always come first. We continue to work directly with operators like Lime to modify regulations so that these priorities can co-exist responsibly.” While several scooter and bike companies continue to hold permits to operate in San Diego, several of the players have collected their equipment and left town. Uber’s Jump bikes and Skip’s scooters left in September. The exiting scooter and bike companies — Lime included — have grumbled over San Diego’s policies around impounding devices. The city reserves the right to seize parked scooters for several reasons, from obstructing car traffic to clogging sidewalks to blocking ramps for the disabled. It collected roughly a quarter-million dollars in fees as a result of impounding more than 3,700 vehicles, as of October. A Lime spokesperson said the company wants more transparency from San Diego officials. “We’re not given a reason why (our products) are impounded, nor a notification that it happened,” the spokesperson said. “Then there’s no ability for us to go back and update the user on what they did wrong. We have to pay a fine and we’re told we’re improper.” Lime said this lack of transparency is unique to San Diego. “We don’t experience that in other markets.” The company started shutting shut down its local operations Thursday, withdrawing all of its scooters and closing down its 33,000-square-foot warehouse in Old Town. Lime was unable to give an exact date the scooters would be removed from the streets altogether. The remaining e-scooter operators in San Diego include Bird, Lyft and Spin. The remaining e-bike company is Wheels.

""We’re grateful to our team members, riders, Juicers and communities who supported us throughout this journey.

The company said it tried to work with city leaders on compliance and safety concerns, but was instead forced to defend its permit — which it did successfully. Lime added that the city's most recent regulations have led to a decrease in ridership and that the city has not been transparent when it comes to towing by city-contracted and private towing companies. In December, city council leaders voted to ban electric scooters from the city's boardwalks at Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay Park Bayside Walk, and La Jolla Shores. A month before, city leaders passed new regulations for e-scooters and bicycles, including a speed limit drop from 15 to 8 miles per hour on boardwalks, a ban on parking scooters in certain areas, and permitting fees. Lime said it is also ending operations in Atlanta, Phoenix, and San Antonio as part of its ""path to profitability.""

Lime Pulls Scooters From San Diego,NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2020,1,9,"Lime Pulls Scooters From San Diego. “Lime Scooters leaving San Diego is another example of what happens when government overreaches,"" one city council member said. Lime Scooter says it will close operations in 12 markets, including San Diego, where the scooters have at times incurred the wrath of residents and politicians. A Lime spokesperson said it will begin to reduce operations in San Diego immediately, and will likely be out of the city by the end of January. “As part of our path to profitability, Lime has made the difficult decision to exit San Diego and focus our resources on markets that allow us to meet our ambitious goals for 2020. We’re grateful to our team members, riders, Juicers and communities who supported us throughout this journey. We appreciate the partnership we’ve enjoyed with San Diego and remain hopeful we can reintroduce Lime back into the community when the time is right,"" said Lime spokesperson Alex Youn. The move comes as a surprise since the company recently won a decision to keep it's operating permit. The city had sought to revoke Lime's permits after alleging it had violated geo-fencing rules that limit the speeds of the devices. The company said San Diego was one of the first cities to welcome the innovation, but one of the last to develop a regulatory framework. Lime suggested the company would have preferred a clear regulatory framework but instead voiced concerns about impound transparency, rogue impound companies, and a potential ban on beach boardwalks that would decrease ridership. The company also expressed frustration of being involved in last December's permit revocation hearing. At its peak, the company had 4,500 devices operating in San Diego. In July, the city approved rules that include a $150 permit fee for each device. Lime would not comment on operating costs or losses in San Diego. The company has faced push back from residents, mostly in beach communities, whose residents say the scooters are a safety hazard. Councilmember Barbara Bry has been vocal in her support of a ban on beach boardwalks and criticized the scooter industry for leading to injuries. “It's clear that the scooter industry has an unsustainable business model. In addition, a study released by the University of California San Francisco documents a dramatic increase in traumatic head injuries at twice the rate of bike riders. The study recommends that scooter riders wear a helmet-- something the City of San Diego cannot require because of state legislation.” Councilmember Chris Cate called Bry's efforts to limit scooters an overreach that disincentives innovation. “Lime Scooters leaving San Diego is another example of what happens when government overreaches. Despite the sensible policies we recently adopted, Councilmember Bry’s proposed an extreme boardwalk ban that disincentives innovation and technology in our City. I strongly encourage everyone that supports this industry to attend the San Diego City Council meeting later this month, when we have the second reading of the proposed ban, to ask the Council majority to rethink their decision. I believe this will not be the last company to leave San Diego if actions like this continue,” Cate said. Last September, Uber pulled their Jump scooters and bikes from San Diego due to the city's regulations. ""We agree with local elected officials in San Diego who’ve said current micromobility regulations foster an unsustainable operating environment, which is why we’re ending our operations as of today,"" Uber said in a statement at the time. The San Diego City Council approved regulations for dockless scooters and bikes in April, including speed limits in certain areas, ""no-ride zones"" and fines for scooter companies who fail to cooperate. Councilmember Scott Sherman attributed Lime's departure to recent changes to boardwalk regulations. “Those who speak warmly of innovation while at the same time knee-capping innovative startups are being hypocritical,” said Sherman. “San Diego leaders need to decide once and for all if we want to be a cutting edge innovative city that embraces new technology or a city that merely tries to ban the future.” ",https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/lime-pulls-scooters-from-san-diego/2241689/
San Diego City Council Approves Ban on Scooters,NBC San Diego,NBC,"San Diego, CA",2020,1,28,"San Diego City Council Approves Ban on Scooters. The San Diego City Council narrowly voted Tuesday to approve a ban on motorized scooters on the city’s boardwalks. In a 5-4 vote, all motorized devices will be banned on beach boardwalks across the city. The vote came on the second reading of the proposal in council. “Today was a big win in prioritizing public safety over corporate interests,” President Pro Tem Barbara Bry’s office wrote in a press release to NBC 7. “This is a public safety issue, not a transportation or mobility issue.” Now that the ordinance has been approved, the San Diego city clerk has two days to send the proposal to the mayor's office. Then, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer has 10 days to sign the ordinance. If he signs the proposal, it will take effect 30 days after that. Therefore, if the mayor signs the ordinance, the earliest the ban could take effect would be Feb. 27. The latest would be March 10. This is not the first time the city of San Diego has regulated electric scooters and other devices inside its borders. Starting July 1, 2019, new dockless bike and scooter rules were implemented in the city, including speed limits and geofencing banned areas. Other institutions, like San Diego State University, have also regulated electric scooters, which the school called “micro-mobility devices.” Starting in the fall of 2019, all dockless scooters, bikes, hoverboards, and roller skates were banned from campus. At the start of the new year, Lime Scooter pulled its devices from San Diego, as well as 11 other markets. The dockless bicycle craze first reached San Diego in early 2018 and dockless scooters were close behind. A report from SDSU's Parking and Transportation Services (PATS) found that between 2017 and 2018, there was a 22 percent increase in scooter, bicycle and skateboard incidents.

The city of San Diego installed 140 signs along beach boardwalks ahead of the ban that begins Feb. 29. The city of San Diego has begun installing new signage along beach boardwalks advising beachgoers that motorized scooters and other devices are prohibited. But at the same time, there has been a significant decrease in the number of scooter permits issued by the city. The San Diego City Council recently approved a scooter ban on beach boardwalks that will go into effect Feb. 29. There will be a 30-day grace period before they begin issuing citations, according to the San Diego Police Department. “We’ll have a 30-day grace period, essential, where we come out and do education. We will be making enforcement stops. However, they will result in written warning as opposed to actual traffic citations,” SDPD traffic officer Anthony Obregon said. After the grace period citations will cost violators $250, Obregon said. Meanwhile, the city said there has been a more than 50% decrease in the number of scooter permits it’s issued since last July. Scooter companies must apply for permits every six months. In July 2019, there were 22,300 mobility device permits issued, according to the city. As of January, there were 11,050. Three companies, Lime, Jump, and Skip have left the San Diego Market. Those companies accounted for 7,650 devices. Bird Scooter currently has the largest number of scooters in San Diego, though the number has decreased from 9,000 to 6,000, according to the city. NBC San Diego reached out to Bird but the company has yet to respond. Pedestrian safety advocates are skeptical the numbers are the result of a business decision made by the companies. “In the summer months, we’ve got lots of tourists, these things are placed in places that tourists use. In the winter months, there are fewer tourists. I think we’re finding that the companies don’t want to pay to have more vehicles available,” said Jonathan Freeman with the group Safe Walkways. Freeman also said the signs being put up by the city won’t matter, unless the city actually enforces the ban. “The issue isn’t the number of scooters, we could have three times more scooters. If all the people that used the scooters used them responsibly, and with consideration for the rest of the community,” said Freeman.

Despite being illegal, the scooters will be geo-fenced to 3 miles-per-hour on the boardwalks, which the city says is slower than typical walking speed and the safest way to enforce the ban. The move comes as scooter companies continue to pull out of San Diego amid other new regulations. City data shows that there 11,300 permitted devices in January, down from 22,300 in July 2019. The city installed its first signs warning of the ban at La Jolla Shores, where nobody was riding a scooter down the boardwalk around noon on Thursday.

""People used to just littler the boardwalk with them, so it's a good decision."" Officers will issue warnings for the first 30 days, with citations starting after that.

Police officers to issue warnings for the first 30 days and then citations thereafter. Starting Saturday, electric scooters will be banned along the boardwalk from Mission Bay to La Jolla. San Diego police officers will enforce the restrictions, which extend to all shared mobility devices, issuing warnings for the first 30 days and then citations thereafter. Scooter companies, such as Lime and Bird, which have opposed the ban, will now be required to use geofencing technology to slow their devices down to 3 mph in the boardwalk areas to discouraging riding. The prohibition will not apply to motorized devices for the disabled. The city has started posting signs along the boardwalk warning beachgoers of the ban. The City Council voted 5-4 in December to approve the restrictions, which were spearheaded by Councilwoman Barbara Bry. The ban follows a sustained outcry from beach communities about the dangers of e-scooters, which can travel up to 15 mph. A number of people are been seriously injured throughout the city riding the devices, including several fatalities. Police officers had not been enforcing the 8 mph speed limit along the boardwalk using radar guns because the city has not done a state-required speed study for the area. Authorities said that they have had to rely on identifying speeders visually. Areas off limits to motorized riders include the boardwalks in Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay Park, Bayside Walk and La Jolla Shores. The new ban comes after the city imposed a suite of other regulations on dockless scooter companies last July. The rules required companies to limit speeds in a number of other locations, such as Balboa Park. Scooter companies have complained that such rules have significantly impacted ridership, which fell sharply last year, according to city data.

Ban on motorized scooters on San Diego boardwalks goes into effect,CBS8,CBS,"San Diego, CA",2020,2,29,"Ban on motorized scooters on San Diego boardwalks goes into effect. The San Diego Police Department will be issuing warnings to motorized scooter riders for the first 30 days and after that warning period, citations will be issued. Feb. 29 marks the first-day electronic scooters, bikes, and other motorized devices are not be allowed on boardwalks at several popular San Diego beaches. The city made this move for safety concerns after numerous injury accidents were reported. Hoping for a fun day to ride scooters down the Mission Beach Boardwalk, Sara and Matt Siemens from Ft. Collins Colorado were in for a scooter shock. “We thought, alright we’ll come up on the boardwalk and kind of [ride] up and down, then we get up we’re like, 'wait it’s not working anymore,' and it slowed down to like hardly moving at all,” said Sara Siemens on a scooter. Not only does geofencing technology slow down the speed of motorized scooters on the boardwalk, but February 29 marks the first day the devices are officially banned on San Diego beach boardwalks. ""No, we thought that was a Leap Day thing. That would’ve been nice to know,” Siemens said. It was smooth sailing for those walking and biking on the boardwalk Saturday where there was hardly a single scooter in sight. San Diego Lifeguards Lt. Rich Stropky said the scooter ban is a blessing. “I think it’s a really good move to kind of clean up the boardwalk, too many pedestrians, too many kids that are vulnerable to anything motorized on this boardwalk here,” Lt. Rich Stropky. Lifeguards say they witnessed and treated far too many scooter accidents along the boardwalk, where riders would crash, fall and collide with others. “We did have very serious medical aids as a result of that,” Stropky said. The city of San Diego plans to install 70 signs to alert scooter users of the big change. ”Not allowing shared mobility devices or any other motorized devices on the oceanfront walk here in Pacific Beach, in Mission Beach in the bayside walk and in La Jolla shores,” said Anthony Santacroce, City of San Diego spokesperson. But some safety advocates say the ban doesn’t go far enough in cases of scooters blocking the sidewalks or private company electric devices that are new and not geofenced. “We’re making progress, and whatever issues come up we are taking time to look at them and evaluate them,” Stropky said. Now with a ban, scooters users from out of town say there aren’t enough safe areas to ride. “Out on the street, there really wasn’t any place to ride the scooters so had to come out in front of a bus or two, and it made it very challenging,” said Matt Siemens. Sara Siemens says there needs to be better signage to alert tourists where it is appropriate for them to ride. “Where can we be safe on them? We are not from here we don’t know where the bike lanes are or where it’s OK to ride these,” she said. The Lyft scooter app shows the boardwalk is restricted. “I’m in this little red zone and it tells me you have three minutes to get out of here,” said Jordan Siemens on the app. Cruising away from the boardwalk, the Siemens family said they use the scooters elsewhere. The San Diego Police Department will be issuing warnings to motorized scooter riders for the first 30 days and after that warning period, citations will be issued.

Scooters nearly went extinct in San Diego due to COVID-19. Now use is climbing again,San Diego Union-Tribune,LA Times,"San Diego, CA",2020,8,27,"Scooters nearly went extinct in San Diego due to COVID-19. Now use is climbing again. Will micro-mobility survive COVID-19’s hit in San Diego? Electric scooters and bikes, once swarming San Diego’s most lively hubs by the tens of thousands, nearly reached extinction during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. By one week in late April, a full month after Governor Gavin Newsom’s first stay-at-home order, the average number of scooters deployed on San Diego streets nearly flat-lined to only 93 devices over 342 square miles. That was down 99 percent from its height last August, when 13,726 on average were deployed throughout the city. Now, a small spike in use might indicate survival for the few companies that remain on the street. That’s according to new data collected by the Union-Tribune from the City of San Diego, which tracks how many “micro-mobility” devices from companies like Bird and Lyft are deployed — and being used daily — in San Diego. The number of devices deployed on city streets rose from that near-death number in April to 2,957 in mid-August. The total number of daily rides on those deployed scooters and bikes has risen from an average of 231 at the lowest point in April to 6,969 daily rides last week. The recovery shows a willingness of residents and tourists to get out and about, perhaps commuting to work once more. Despite the uptick, the future of micro-mobility in San Diego remains in question. Although 6,969 daily rides looks a lot better than 231, it’s a far cry from the average this time last year. During the same period in 2019, daily rides averaged 21,750. Use of e-scooters and e-bikes was already on the decline well before the pandemic. City regulations — put in place after a public outcry — required operators to make sure their scooters were permitted, parked and used appropriately. The rules were unpopular with the tech companies, which were already seeing ridership declines and mounting costs. Several of them exited the San Diego market. Jump bikes (which Uber has sold to Lime) and Skip scooters were pulled from San Diego in September 2019, and Lime left in January 2020. Those remaining include Bird, Lyft, Razor, Spin and Wheels. But these companies have significantly reduced their footprint over the past 12 months. Bird, the scooter company with the most devices in San Diego, was permitted to deploy 9,000 scooters last September. Today, its permit only asks for 3,000 to be deployed, and even fewer are likely to be on the streets.

Tampa jumps on the hot new craze: electric scooters,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2018,10,24,"Tampa jumps on the hot new craze: electric scooters. Electric scooter rentals are the latest fad for moving around downtowns, and they could be coming to town as soon as February. The city has issued a request for applications for up to three electric scooter rental companies to bring that technology to Tampa, said city spokeswoman Ashley Bauman. Patrons would only be able to ride the scooters on sidewalks and multi-use paths, not on streets or bike lanes. Interested companies can apply to join the one-year pilot program through Nov. 9. ""We're trying to get ahead of the regulation and be proactive,"" Bauman said. ""We know they're coming. They've dropped in every city."" Electric scooters have popped up in dozens of cities across the county, such as Cincinnati, Indianapolis, San Francisco and New York. They often cost as little as $1 to start riding and then 15 cents for each minute after. All users have to do is download an app, enter a credit card and scan a barcode to unlock the scooter. People can pick up the scooters wherever they find them — sidewalks, parks, docking stations — and ride them as far as they want to go. The scooters can go as fast as 5 to 8 mph. (For comparison, segways top out around 12 mph.) When the ride is finished, the scooters can be left right there at the end of the trip. No docking or plug-in required — patrons just need to make sure they're life in a public space that doesn't block traffic. Several companies are trying to seize on the excitement around the grab-and-go scooter program. Bird, Lime, Skip, Scoot and Spin all offer scooter rentals through an app on the user's smartphone. ""We also want to get ahead of scooter companies just setting up shop and creating issues, as has occurred in other cities in the U.S.,"" Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said. St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman was seen testing out a Lime scooter in front of City Hall earlier this month. ""Giving Lime Bike a whirl,"" the mayor tweeted on Oct. 11 with a picture of him grinning on a scooter. ""We still have a way to go and some issue to work through in order to get these on our streets, but I remain committed to diversifying transit in the Burg."" The mayor is interested in bringing the scooters to downtown, but St. Petersburg isn't as far along in the process as Tampa, said Kriseman's spokesman Ben Kirby said. Clearwater spokesman Rob Shaw said the city first needs to figure out a bike share program — Clearwater is hoping for a countywide approach — before tackling the latest transportation craze. Tampa is prepared to bring on as many as 1800 scooters online for the pilot program. The rentals will be available south of E Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, with Armenia Avenue acting as the western boundary and N 40th Street marking the eastern boundary. No more than 300 scooters would be allowed in any of the four main areas: downtown, and then three zones west, east and north of downtown. An additional 600 would be spread between E Columbus Drive and MLK Boulevard. The program will see about 180 parking corrals set up, each holding 10 scooters, spread through the service zones.",https://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/Tampa-jumps-on-the-hot-new-craze-electric-scooters_172936340/
Tampa to see electric scooters zipping through downtown in new pilot program,Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2018,10,29,"Tampa to see electric scooters zipping through downtown in new pilot program. Move over people, electric scooters are coming to downtown Tampa. The city is seeking applications to select up to three operators to provide motorized scooter sharing services in designated areas in the city as part of a Shared Motorized Scooter Pilot Program. ""A few months back we were working on ordinance changes for a dockless bike program, but scooter companies kept approaching us. The mayor then shifted gears to start looking at the motorized scooters,"" Transportation and Stormwater Services Department Director Jean Duncan said. The program would run for a year and there would be 1,800 scooters placed in different areas throughout downtown with 300 being the maximum amount for the four designated sections. However, 600 additional scooters would be spread between E. Columbus Drive and MLK Boulevard. Several major cities have started testing dockless electric scooter programs including Coral Gables, which was the first Florida city to launch a test program in August. Tampa started advertising the request for proposals in mid-October. The deadline for companies to submit a proposal is Nov. 9. These are the suppliers that have responded to the RFP: Bird Rides Inc. Coast Bike Share Drop Mobility Frank Underwood Law JUMP RSA Consulting Group LLC Sharp Marketing Skinny Labs Skip Scooters Recommended Tampa is hoping to have the scooters as early as February. The operators must have the ability to provide revenue share data with the city for future revenue sharing options between the operator and city; financial viability and stability, and adequacy of insurance; experience operating shared mobility device systems; and provide public education and engagement strategies for helmet use and road safety compliance among other items. The motorized scooters are not legal to operate on public roads, because they cannot be licensed and registered as motor vehicles. However, people can ride the scooters on sidewalks and multi-use paths. The scooters can go as fast as 5 to 8 mph. Due to this being a dockless program, the city is proposing to do 180 corrals, or painted areas, where the scooters could be placed. ""We decided if we don’t try this with a pilot program and have no limitation, the companies will come in and negative consequences happen such as safety issues,"" Duncan said. The mode of transit has caused issues in cities testing them. For example, in North Carolina, Raleigh’s Office of Transportation Planning had tracked 33 complaints citing scooters blocking right-of-way, concerns about safety and issues of scooters being staged on private property. A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Bird Rides, which is one of the suppliers that responded to Tampa's RFP, LimeBike and other companies involved in the proliferation of shared electric scooters. The lawsuit claims that Bird’s and Lime’s safety instructions fall short, that their scooters have mechanical issues, and that the companies have breached the warranties on their devices, which are “not suitable” for repeated public use, Tampa Bay Business Journal's sister news organization L.A. Biz reported. Three of the lawsuit’s eight initial plaintiffs allege they were pedestrians hit by scooters from behind. Although Lime couldn't comment due to it being a pending litigation, Bird told the Journal: “We believe that the climate crisis and our car dependency demand a transportation mode shift, and clean energy vehicles like e-scooters are already replacing millions of short car trips. There is no evidence that riding an e-scooter presents a greater level of danger to riders than riding a bike. Cars remain the greatest threat to commuters, killing over 40,000 people in the U.S. yearly.” Tampa is well aware of the issues though, but hopes that this program will be implemented safely and help serve as another mode of transit. ""We see this as a pioneering front to explore. We want to learn from past lessons we've seen in other cities,"" Duncan said. This is why in the RFP is outlines specific details, she said. Despite the safety issues, cities across the country such as Dallas have seen the popularity with the e-scooter sharing program where more than 450,000 trips were recorded on them between July and nearly the end of September through its two main providers, Bird and Lime. That added up to almost 600,000 miles, according to TBBJ's sister paper the Dallas Business Journal. The city will look at performance measures at the end of the year to evaluate the different companies and assuming it all goes well, it will issue another RFP that will probably select one sole vendor to serve the city, Duncan said.

"Editorial: Scooters are coming, and Tampa Bay should be prepared",Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2018,11,16,"Editorial: Scooters are coming, and Tampa Bay should be prepared. Electric scooters are coming to Tampa early next year — the newest development in the urban ""micro mobility"" craze. The Tampa City Council has signed off on an experiment and rules aimed at avoiding issues created by a flood of dockless scooters in cities that weren't prepared. It's smart for Tampa and other cities around Tampa Bay to create a framework and strategy for regulating scooters before they show up. In September 2017, scooter-share startup Bird dumped hundreds of motorized scooters on the streets of Santa Monica, Calif., without permission from the city. Other companies joined the fray, and the scooters spread to other big cities. No surprise, the scooters caused some problems, eliciting complaints from residents about dangerous sidewalk use and haphazard parking. Santa Monica, San Francisco and Austin are among the cities that rushed to update city regulations, as various scooter-share companies jumped in to duke it out with one another. The same thing happened in Miami this summer. Scooters hit Miami for about two weeks before the city issued cease and desist letters. Local officials needed answers. Should scooters be confined to bike lanes or roads or sidewalks? Will scooters cause more sidewalk crashes? Should these companies be required to help fund infrastructure for small vehicles? These questions are important ones, and they are best thought through before scooters come to town. Tampa has issued a request for applications for up to three electric scooter rental companies to bring dockless scooters to city streets in February. Looking to Santa Monica as a model, Tampa has mapped out certain rules for companies to follow in a yearlong experiment. As many as 1,800 scooters could operate on the sidewalks south of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, between Armenia Avenue and 40th Street, a 12-square mile area. The city plans to have the selected companies paint ""parking corrals"" in designated areas. Moving fast to test out different regulations is not necessarily a bad thing. In July, Coral Gables passed an emergency ordinance to ban unauthorized scooters and bikes, and in the same meeting approved an exclusive short experiment with dockless scooter company Spin, becoming the first city in Florida to allow scooters on its streets. Now, the city has branched out, striking short term agreements with other companies. But cities in Tampa Bay have the chance to be ahead of the curve: they should do their research and determine their strategy before the scooters arrive. The Florida Legislature also should consider changes in state law to deal with scooters. Tampa plans to allow scooters on sidewalks, but state law bans them from operating in bike lanes and streets. Bird policy director Matt Kopko points to another Florida statute that carves out authority for local governments to adopt and enforce temporary or experimental regulations for ""emergencies or special conditions."" Even if this statute might give cities some leeway to put scooters in bike lanes, it's only a temporary answer. If small dockless vehicles — scooters, bicycles and even vespas — are here to stay, bike lanes may be more appropriate for them than sidewalks. That's something the Florida Legislature should look into next spring.",https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorial-scooters-are-coming-and-tampa-bay-should-be-prepared-20181116/
Hillsborough County eyes electric scooters,Florida Politics,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2018,12,5,"Hillsborough County eyes electric scooters. Hillsborough County is moving forward with plans to bring electric scooters to the county. Hillsborough County Commissioners voted to have county attorneys work with staff from the electric scooter company Bird on how and where to implement service. Electric scooters are an emerging micro-mobility transit solution aimed at providing first mile/last mile solutions to transit users for trips that are too far to walk, but too short to drive. Over the last year, Bird has provided 10 million rides throughout the areas it services. Hillsborough County Commissioner Sandra Murman who brought the issue before the board said she hopes the service can launch in the University of South Florida area. “I think it fits,” Murman said. “You don’t have a lot of cars [and there’s] a lot of people.” The scooters cost $1 to unlock and then 20 cents per minute they are used. Riders can check out a scooter through a smartphone app. The $1 unlock fee is waived for users on public assistance. The service would not cost taxpayers. Bird scooters can be located at pre-stationed docks or through dock free use where riders can locate one on the app. The county would determine rules about scooter usage including whether riders would use them on sidewalks, roads or bike lanes. Bird also offers helmets to customers for $1.99. Users can order a helmet on the company’s website. The company is still looking into Florida’s helmet laws for scooters to determine whether or not helmets are required or just suggested. Hillsborough County Commissioner Kimberly Overman said she’s glad the company offers low-cost helmets because she has a family member affected by head injury. “On the other hand, I would never get on one,” Overman joked. “I do appreciate there’s going to be a lot of folks [who do.]” Once county attorneys establish an implementation plan that would come back to commissioners for approval.",https://floridapolitics.com/archives/282643-hillsborough-electric-scooters
"Electric Scooters Set to Take Tampa by Storm, But are They Safe?",South Florida Reporter,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2018,12,16,"Electric Scooters Set to Take Tampa by Storm, But are They Safe? In Florida, e-scooter use is on the rise. Short, one to five-mile journeys can often take an hour or longer because of the inconvenience of it all. By contrast, stationless e-scooters are taking public streets by storm as a reliable way to complete short journeys while creating minimal pollution to the environment. As cities wrestle with what the right public policy should be about their usage, riders must be concerned about safety issues. While e-scooter companies like Spin and Lime are growing rapidly, they rely on a partnership model between the local city or town and the company to get permission for riders on their streets. Not every local authority is happy about the idea either. While bicycles often have their own lanes, there’s no such thing for e-scooters in many U.S. cities. They’re just too new. Tampa Set to Accept E-Scooters in Late 2019 Presently, parts of South Florida, like Key Biscayne and a few areas within Miami, already accept e-scooters (Lime ones, mainly), Tampa is taking a slow, careful approach. They’ve opened the doors to applications from e-scooter companies that wish to operate in Tampa renting out rides in much the same way that Uber does. Tampa plans to accept a total of 2,000 e-scooters on its roads. However, this comes with a caveat that several areas will only permit 300 scooters at one time, with the exception of the busy stretch between East Columbus Drive and Martin Luther King Boulevard, which has been expanded to 600 scooters. How they plan to regulate the numbers is still unclear. Have E-Scooter; Will Travel. But Are They Safe? While there will eventually be 180 areas approved for e-scooter use in Tampa, there is the question of how safe the scooters are to use on the roads and sidewalks? There have been cases in the U.S. of car drivers colliding with people riding on scooters who were protected by nothing more than a helmet, and perhaps some gloves and knee pads. Currently, it’s only expected that e-scooters will be allowed to ride on sidewalks within Tampa. However, at some point, these scooters must cross a road, so the risk of having an accident is not completely removed. Also, if scooters aren’t forced to only ride in a designated bike or scooter lanes, then pedestrians who don’t have a protective helmet are put in the firing line. Frustrations are Growing with E-Scooter Use Not everyone is happy with e-scooters buzzing past them on the sidewalk or blocking up the roads. Some of the Lime and Bird scooters are having to be fished out of rivers and lakes because frustrated people are disposing of them. Tampa plans to restrict their speed to 8 MPH to avoid the worst that could happen, but this might not be enough.",https://southfloridareporter.com/stationless-electric-scooters-set-to-take-tampa-by-storm-but-not-without-safety-concerns/

The reissued request, which hasn't published yet, means that all the companies that originally submitted an application in mid-October when it was advertised will now have their applications tossed out. Interested companies included Bird Rides Inc., JUMP, Gotcha Mobility LLC and many others. The new application deadline is Feb. 11.

Electric scooters can now ride in Tampa streets and bike lanes,Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,1,19,"Electric scooters can now ride in Tampa streets and bike lanes. All those people zipping around Tampa sidewalks on electric scooters can now legally ride them in city streets and bike lanes, greatly expanding choices for a program that is being closely watched by governments around Tampa Bay. The scooters, which are not supposed to go faster than 15 mph, were limited to sidewalks until Gov. Ron Desantis signed a bill this week lifting the restriction. They are meant to help people get to destinations that are too far to walk, but not far enough to merit a car trip. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone. Not everyone is thrilled with the new flexibility. Some riders worry about having to depend on drivers for their safety, a lament often heard from local bicyclists. Some don't think the scooters are safe in any circumstance. ""I don't think they should be on streets at all,"" said Tampa resident Robin Miskel, 38, who said her father broke his kneecap when he tripped over a scooter in California. Timur Cachia-Aydin, 31, said he is glad scooters will be allowed on roads in a city that lacks good public transportation. But he worries about liability. ""If I'm on a scooter and get hurt due to a mechanical issue, are the companies or the City of Tampa liable?"" he asked. Vivian Myrtetus, the government affairs manager for the Florida branch of Lime, one of four companies renting scooters in Tampa, called the bill signing ""a win."" She said it provides clarity to municipalities looking to offer the scooters, which have found a market in a number of cities around the United States. The new rides were rolled out here in May as part of a year-long pilot program. Around 170 scooters are now in operation, said Jean Duncan, the city's transportation director. That number could grow to as many as 2,400 during the pilot. Data on whether riders are obeying speed limits is still being collected, Duncan said. But there have been problems. During the first weeks of operation, people were spotted riding the scooters in banned areas, such as the Tampa Riverwalk, or parking them haphazardly and blocking sidewalks and entryways. Scooters are required to be docked in specific locations called ""corrals."" Duncan said the city is hoping for a maximum of 240 corrals. No-ride zones include the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City. Duncan said she's been pleasantly surprised at the relatively small number of complaints she's received so far. That could change by Aug. 1, she acknowledged, when she meets with the Tampa City Council to discuss citizen grievances. ""We just really want to keep the message out there that we want this program to stay but it takes a safe management of it,"" Duncan said. Sen. Jeff Brandes, a St. Petersburg Republican and one of the bill's sponsors, said the bill provides cities with local control over how and where the scooters can be used. ""We wanted to make sure of that because this is a new and evolving technology,'' he said. While details of the city's operating agreements with the scooter companies can change, Duncan expects their access to Tampa's roads and bike lanes to remain.

Will scooters help or hurt the way we get around in Tampa Bay? We're about to find out.,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,2,8,"Will scooters help or hurt the way we get around in Tampa Bay? We're about to find out. Florida law prohibits scooter companies from entering cities that haven't approved regulations on the vehicles. But the craze is still headed this way. Tampa Bay so far has dodged one of the biggest crazes to sweep the nation in the past year. But it won't be long before electric scooters are here, too, zipping people across town and potentially changing how they think about transportation. Electric, dockless scooters invaded dozens of cities in 2018 — sometimes overnight and with little-to-no warning. They quickly elicited strong reactions. Some praised the sharable scooters as the perfect option for trips that are too far to comfortably walk, but too short to merit driving. Others deemed them a fad, a nuisance at best and a safety threat at worst. But while other cities have spent much of 2018 determining if and how to allow scooters into their downtowns, much of Florida has stayed out of the mix. That's because many local governments interpreted current Florida law as prohibiting companies like Lime and Bird from entering their markets unless an ordinance exists. Fort Lauderdale is the only Florida city to fully embrace scooters so far. A pilot program is underway in Coral Gables and Miami is planning one. Tampa Bay could see its first electric scooters in April when Tampa launches its pilot program. The city will dispatch as many as 1,800 scooters in a 12-square-mile area around downtown and south of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Hillsborough County is researching a potential pilot, but staff has not released any details. Meanwhile, St. Petersburg is waiting to see what statewide regulations might pass this year, though Mayor Rick Kriseman has spoken positively about the impact scooters could have. ""In terms of providing our citizens and visitors more options, it's something we should embrace,"" St. Petersburg Transportation Director Evan Mory said. ""But the practical concerns about how they mix with all the other modes and what decisions the state will make becomes a little challenging."" While politicians debate when and how to bring scooters to the Sunshine State, much can be learned from what other municipalities have done. ""It all happened so fast,"" said Chris Spencer, with the Greensboro, N.C., Department of Transportation. ""If you can get out in front of it, that's definitely the way to go."" The concept of sharable, electric scooters that people can rent using their smart phone debuted in many cities last year. Bird and Lime, along with smaller businesses, spread rapidly through places like San Francisco, Washington D.C., Oakland, Calif., Portland, Ore., Austin, Seattle, Nashville, Indianapolis, Atlanta and Cincinnati. The companies all use the same concept: provide dockless scooters that travel 8-15 mph — no faster than the average speed of a bicycle — and allow people to rent them using a smartphone app. The scooters are immobile until then and will cut power if the user tries to ride them out of their operating zones. Perhaps the biggest appeal — and drawback — is that people can pick them up and deposit them wherever they choose. This makes riding to work or a restaurant more convenient than a shared bike that has to be returned to a designated rack. Simply ride the scooter to your location and park it on the sidewalk out front. But along with that convenience comes a problem: People have been reckless about where they park. Some refuse to use the kickstand and drop the scooters when they're done, blocking sidewalks, disability access ramps and parking garage entrances. But by many measures, the concept has proven to be a success. Bird and Lime are valued at more than $1 billion each. Lime now operates on five continents. The company, which also includes bike and car shares, topped more than 26 million trips worldwide. About 20 million of those rides occurred between July and December 2018. Greensboro, a city of about 280,000 people, logged about 40,000 rides on Lime and Bird scooters in just a few months. Other cities measured numbers of Lime riders — more than 85,000 in Atlanta in the second half of 2018, for example. Austin counted 275,000 riders last year and Los Angeles 435,000. The company says the average age of its scooter users is 32. Google Maps now includes scooters as an option when using the app to plan a trip. Want to go from one side of a city to the other? Google might suggest you take a bus for the first few miles, then pick up a scooter for the last stretch between the transit station and a nearby restaurant or work place. ""It's putting a focus on the quality of streets for people … and how we need facilities designed for bikes and scooters and people and less for fast-moving cars,"" Atlanta planning commissioner Tim Keane said. ""It's a very positive phenomenon."" It's not all quick trips and easy rides, though. Scooters drew sharp criticism almost immediately, with riders zipping into traffic, nearly toppling pedestrians, parking haphazardly, blocking sidewalks and right of ways. Injuries have ranged from skinned knees to broken wrists, and often require hospital visits. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is launching a study to investigate scooter-related crashes and how they could be prevented. The craze has also inspired vandalism. The internet is full of pictures and videos of people taking out their anger on scooters, snapping them in half, lighting them on fire, throwing them off of buildings. On Bird Graveyard, an Instagram account, nearly 78,000 followers scroll through 259 posts depicting broken and burning scooters. One video shows a scooter crowd surfacing through a mosh pit at a metal concert before its implied demise. But Florida Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, who filed legislation to open the state up to scooters, said new transportation modes always face criticism. ""The public hated the automobile when it first came out, too,"" Brandes said. ""They cursed airplanes upon their early adoption. Cities had huge concerns with Uber and Lyft. But ultimately we come to realize they play an important role in mobility and we accept that."" Cities are learning from each other as they compose guidelines for the new transportation trend. After the companies crashed onto main streets without warning, many local governments put temporary bans in place while they drafted regulations. A permit structure seems the most popular approach to instilling some order, though fees and restrictions vary wildly between jurisdictions. In Greensboro, for example, each company must pay $500 to operate locally, and dish out an extra $50 per scooter it deploys. Atlanta requires $12,000 for a company to operate its first 500 scooters, and $50 for every one after that. For Tampa's proposed pilot, the city is asking companies to pay $20,000 to deploy up to 600 scooters. Each of those scooters is charged $1 a day, or $365 for the year. While no data is yet available on the subject, transportation experts speculate that scooters could lead to higher transit use. Because bus and train stops are often spaced relatively far apart, transit has struggled with the ""first-mile, last-mile problem"" of how to get people from their stop to their destination efficiently and affordably. ""They're not just for fun, they're actually functional,"" Lime Florida spokeswoman Vivian Myrtetus said. ""People are getting out of their cars and using (scooters) for an actual mode of transportation. It's not just a toy."" A woman picks up a scooter near her rail stop and rides it to a work meeting a dozen blocks away for about $5. Friends take transit to a concert or sporting event, knowing they can use scooters to jump around town afterward. Uses like that open transit systems to ""choice riders"" — people who have cars but decide to use public transportation instead. ""It gives the transit a broader reach for a lot of people,"" Keane said. ""It's really expanding transit areas and has huge potential there."" But state legislation or a local ordinance first needs to pass before any of this — good, bad and unknown — can happen in Tampa Bay. Currently, scooters can operate in the Sunshine State only where a city or county passes an ordinance. An even then, they are allowed only on sidewalks, not in streets or bike paths. Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo, R-Tampa, have filed bills to open up the state to scooters. ""We want to clarify that these devices are allowed to be used on bike paths, sidewalks and anywhere typically where a bike can be ridden,"" Brandes said. Regulation would be ""exclusively controlled by state and federal law,"" under the legislation. Cities and counties could pass their own ordinances, but they could not be in conflict with state law and could not be more restrictive than the local rules for bicycles. That means a city like St. Petersburg could not ban scooters from operating on its busy sidewalks unless it also extended that rule to bikes. Scooter riders also would have the same rights as cyclists under the proposed law. No driver's license would be required, though the companies would have to maintain commercial liability insurance. People would have to park their scooters in a way ""that does not upend the normal movement of pedestrian traffic."" In addition, the law would extend to similar shared modes of transportation that could arise in the future. ""We're trying to be broad in the definitions because this is a very quickly evolving landscape,"" Brandes said. ""It's a simple, straightforward regulatory structure that is easy for cities to understand.""",https://www.tampabay.com/transportation/will-scooters-help-or-hurt-the-way-we-get-around-in-tampa-bay-were-about-to-find-out-20190211/

Tampa selects 3 e-scooter companies for pilot program,WTSP,CBS,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,3,5,"Tampa selects 3 e-scooter companies for pilot program. Around 1,800 scooters are expected to become available to the public in April. The city of Tampa has selected three electric scooter companies for its pilot program set to launch next month. Spin, JUMP and Bird Rides are expected to be awarded contracts to operate dockless rental scooters around downtown Tampa for the year-long pilot program. The premise is simple: People in Tampa will be able to rent the electric scooters for $1, plus the 10-15 cents per minute to use. The start-up companies rely on people who roam the streets looking to charge the scooters at night for $5-$20 per scooter. The proposals are set to go before the Tampa City Council for official approval, according to Director of Transportation Jean Duncan. Duncan said with the city council’s approval, the companies can start operating April 1. Each company will have up to 600 scooters just south of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between about Armenia Avenue and North 40th Street, Duncan said. Duncan said e-scooters would not be allowed on the city’s Riverwalk or Bayshore Boulevard. Also, the e-scooters are only allowed on sidewalks because of Florida law. Duncan said while Tampa city staff won't lobby to change state law, they are hopeful it changes anyway. The city is working with the University of South Florida to develop performance metrics to evaluate the three companies. At the end of the pilot program in April 2020, Duncan said the city would likely select one vendor much like the existing Coast Bike Program. “Part of what we’ll decide is, should we have one vendor?” Duncan said. “That’s not 100 percent decided right now.” The Tampa City Council is scheduled to meet March 21 to formally approve the three e-scooter companies selected for the city’s pilot program.",https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/hillsboroughcounty/tampa-selects-3-e-scooter-companies-for-pilot-program/67-a03d3144-9f0a-4131-a69a-f3de9f600c63
Tampa adds Lime to electric scooter vendor pilot; delays launch slightly,Florida Politics,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,3,21,"Tampa adds Lime to electric scooter vendor pilot; delays launch slightly. Instead of having 1,800 scooters with three vendors, four vendors will provide 2,400 scooters. In Tampa, electric scooters might come a little later than first expected. On Thursday, the Tampa City Council granted a staff request to delay its vote on vendors for its Shared Motorized Scooter Pilot Program. The city identified three vendors to provide a combined total 1,800 electric scooters in and around downtown, setting the pilot project to begin in early April. After receiving protests from two additional vendors, the city decided to add a fourth vendor, Lime. As a result, the decision means city staffers have to amend contracts, operating agreements and other documents before receiving approval from Councilmembers. The only substantive change — instead of having 1,800 scooters provided by three vendors, four vendors will provide a combined total of 2,400 scooters. The city expects the new program to now launch as early as mid-April, possibly not until early May. City Council is expected to approve those contracts at a meeting April 4. The other three chosen vendors include Bird, JUMP, a service through Uber, and Spin. The rest of the details in the contracts will be unchanged. Each vendor will have to pay the city an operating fee of $20,000 and an additional $365 per device. Each vendor will provide 600 scooters, which means they’ll each pay the city $239,000. The companies will keep any revenue derived from the pay-per-use services they provide and will be required to provide operational data and revenue information to the city. They will also have to make available a company liaison to work with the city and address any issues with the program as they arise. That oversight is aimed at ensuring companies are employing safe operating practices. The companies will provide 100 scooters each to areas in downtown, north of downtown, west of downtown and east of downtown and another 200 scooters each to an expansion area between Columbus Avenue and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Armenia Avenue and 40th Street. The companies will also have to provide 30 corals per 100 scooters to house the vehicles when they’re not in use. The pilot program will span one year. The city is working with the University of South Florida to develop a series of performance metrics to determine whether or not to continue using scooters after the one-year pilot. If the city decides to continue the service, a new request for proposal process will open for one or more companies to be chosen to operate programs on a more permanent basis. None of the scooters will be able to be used on Riverwalk or the Bayshore Drive sidewalk. Under existing Florida law, the scooters can only be operated on sidewalks. Scooters are quickly becoming a popular micro-mobility solution to first-mile/last-mile problems.",https://floridapolitics.com/archives/291523-tampa-adds-lime-to-electric-scooter-vendor-pilot-delays-launch-slightly

Shea Carson got his first taste of using an e-scooter on a trip to Nashville. ""[I] spent the whole day riding up and down the hills having a great time,"" he said. He had been waiting for them to come to Tampa. Finally on Memorial Day Weekend, the scooters appeared all over downtown Tampa. ""You get to be not only around in the city, but feel the city.

The city of Tampa launched its electric scooter pilot program over the weekend. City officials had postponed the launch of the pilot program several times.

The startup companies rely on people who roam the streets looking to charge the scooters at night for $5-$20 per scooter. Tampa will have four vendors provide about 2,400 scooters.

It’s nice to get around quick when you don’t have to bring the bike downstairs from the condo. I’m looking forward to it. We’re going to go ride to lunch.” This is just the beginning of the year-long trial as Jean Duncan, the director of transportation for the city of Tampa, explains. “Time will tell whether this was a good decision. We’re hoping it is because we do think that people want a different choice besides bicycling and walking to get a short distance to where they are going.” Scooters are currently not allowed on Bayshore Blvd, the Riverwalk, or on 7th Avenue in Ybor City. And riders are only supposed to use the sidewalk, for now. “The House and the Senate both passed bills that basically give the scooters the same rights as bicycles. We expect that to be approved by the governor soon.” If and when HB 453 is approved, scooters will be able to use the bike lane and some streets.

"Scooters have arrived on Tampa sidewalks, and there are 'growing pains'",Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,5,28,"Scooters have arrived on Tampa sidewalks, and there are 'growing pains'. Electric scooters descended on the city Saturday, with people taking several thousand trips during Memorial Day weekend. But problems have already arisen. People were spotted riding the scooters in banned areas, such as the Tampa Riverwalk, or parking them haphazardly and blocking sidewalks and entryways, Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said. ""We're hoping maybe it's a little bit of growing pains in the first couple days and we'll see better compliance on the part of the operators as well as the users that we wanted to see from the beginning,"" Duncan said. ""This looks good on paper, but is it going to work in reality?"" The latest transportation fad is solidly in place in several cities, but Tampa has taken its time launching the one-year pilot program, which allows up to 2,400 scooters to operate around town. As of Tuesday, only two companies — Spin and Bird — currently have scooters out on the streets for people to ride. Competitors Lime and Jump, the other two companies approved for the pilot, should be running here soon, Duncan said. The scooters can travel up to 15 mph and are meant to help people get to destinations that are too far to comfortably walk, but not far enough to warrant a car trip. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone. Spin reported 2,500 trips on its scooters over the weekend. A Bird spokesman said the company does not share ridership numbers. While people can take trips all over the city, there are a few no-ride zones, including the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City. The city contacted both Spin and Bird with complaints that people were riding scooters in banned areas. Bird said its app prohibits people from riding there and will slow the vehicle gradually to a full stop when a rider enters one of those zones. ""Several riders then think the battery is dead and park it nearby,"" Bird representative Servando Esparza wrote in an email to the city. ""Most will follow the in-app notifications to move outside the riding zone to continue riding."" Spin shared a similar experience, but made a couple additional tweaks to discourage people from riding in those zones and leaving the scooter behind. Spin representative Dan Fleischbein changed the settings so the company's scooters slow down to 10 mph at Curtis Hixon Park and 3 mph in no-ride zones. He also made the Riverwalk a no-park zone. ""It is 3 mph, so it's not rideable, but forces people to remove them from the Riverwalk,"" Flesichbein wrote in an email. ""This appears to solve the problem. We are constantly tweaking and adjusting to create a safe, enjoyable experience for riders and non-riders alike."" Currently, people can ride scooters only on the sidewalk. That will change if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs a bill sponsored by State Sen. Jeff Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo. The legislation from the Tampa Bay Republicans allows scooters on streets and bike paths, but leaves the decisions up to local governments. ""We thought it was important to get everyone on board early on and make sure that cities have maximum flexibility,"" Brandes said. Duncan said the city's attorneys are meeting this week to see how, if at all, the new law would affect the contract Tampa signed with the four scooter companies. In order to try to crack down on the haphazard parking that plagues many cities, Tampa requires scooters to be placed in pre-determined corrals every day. People can then ride the scooter to whatever location they choose and park it anywhere that isn't blocking walkways and traffic. Duncan said the city had permitted 17 corrals as of Tuesday afternoon, but is approving more each day. That means people can expect to see the number of scooters and the variety of locations grow over the next couple weeks. Collin Sherwin, 41, took a Bird scooter Tuesday from his home near Hyde Park to his office downtown. The 2.3 mile trip cost him $6.11 — only a dollar or so less than an Uber. Sherwin said his trips in other cities, like Austin and San Diego, were cheaper. The scooters cost $1 to start, but then vary on how much they charge per minute. Sherwin said he's paid around 15 cents a minute previously, but the cost Tuesday came to around 29 cents a minute, according to his receipt. Even though a scooter doesn't save him much money and takes twice as long as an Uber (16 minutes opposed to 8), Sherwin said he still would prefer to scooter to work, if the weather was good. Sherwin, who gave up his car in 2017, said it's more fun and theoretically a cheaper option than taking a rideshare. But the main reason he prefers his bike or a scooter rental is that he feels more connected to his neighborhood with those than he does in a car. ""When I'm on my bike, I see the signs for a cool happy hour or an upcoming event you might miss,"" Sherwin said. ""The advantage with the scooter is I'm not sweating when I get to work. If I take my bike, there's a chance I'm gross all day."" Brock Bjorn, 33, hasn't had the chance to ride a scooter yet, but said he spotted two near-accidents heading toward Davis Islands. The first involved two people who looked like they were trying to beat the crosswalk signal but were too late, and another was a driver making a right turn while not paying attention, Bjorn said. Sherwin had a near miss while on his way into work, when a car came close to him while both were making a right turn. Bjorn said he'd be hesitant to ride in a busier area like downtown or South Howard, but would be interested in checking them out while in his neighborhood on Davis Islands. ""All progress has it's early issues,"" Bjorn said. ""I don't really see any long-term concern aside from them being left in public walkways.""",https://www.tampabay.com/transportation/scooters-have-arrived-on-tampa-sidewalks-and-there-are-growing-pains-20190528/
Editorial: Keep an eye on Tampa scooters,Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,5,31,"Editorial: Keep an eye on Tampa scooters. That didn't take long. Only days after descending on the city, electric scooters already have created a problem on the streets of Tampa, with people riding them in banned areas and parking them thoughtlessly across sidewalks and entry ways. It's clear the city and the scooter companies have work to do in ensuring that this transportation novelty doesn't become a public nuisance. The scooters arrived a week ago, with people taking several thousand trips during the Memorial Day weekend. But Tampa transportation director Jean Duncan said problems have already arisen, with people entering no-ride zones, including the Riverwalk and Bayshore Boulevard, and dropping the scooters haphazardly across sidewalks and common areas. The companies are responding by tweaking their technology to bring scooters to a stop in banned areas and by creating no-park zones. The city is also approving more corrals across the city to keep parked scooters from blocking the sidewalks. While scooters are currently restricted to sidewalks, a bill awaiting action by Gov. Ron DeSantis would also allow local governments to expand their use to streets and bike paths. That's a more appropriate environment for vehicles that can travel up to 15 mph, and which are designed for longer-haul trips than those taken by the average pedestrian. Tampa's one-year experiment will test the city's resolve and the scooter companies' good faith. If necessary, the city should expand the no-ride zones to protect pedestrians in already-crowded sidewalks and parks. Riders also need to be conscientious and responsible.

Some scooter riders aren't playing by the rules in downtown Tampa,Fox13,Fox,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,6,1,"Some scooter riders aren't playing by the rules in downtown Tampa. Saturday marks one week since e-scooters hit the sidewalks in downtown Tampa, but some riders apparently aren't playing by the rules. The issues come as no surprise to city officials, who say they have witnessed children riding without helmets as well as people riding in the middle of the street and on the Riverwalk, which are all not allowed. The scooters are supposed to be fun, entertaining and convenient, but can also be dangerous if you don't follow the rules. ""I have seen people renting these things for their children and having their child not wear helmets. Riding on the wrong side of the street. Riding in the middle of the street,"" Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said. Currently, e-scooters are only allowed on the sidewalks. As for helmets, companies strongly recommend them, but don't require them. When it comes to age, all of the companies currently operating in Tampa require riders to be at least 18 years old. ""Be a good sport and don't ruin it for others because this is a test pilot and if we mess up they are going to take it away. If you want to enjoy it, follow the rules,"" said rider Devin Wittcoff. The scooters first hit the sidewalks Memorial Day weekend. So far, the city estimates there's already been roughly 5,000 rides taken throughout downtown, which is currently the only area the scooters are allowed. As Jean Duncan with the City of Tampa explains, companies are now improving their GPS technology to control where the scooters can operate. ""If they go off into an area they are not supposed to, the scooter will turn off and roll to a stop. So all four are working on trying to improve and tweak their system so if people aren't do the right thing on their own, the scooters are forcing them to behave,"" Duncan said. In order to ride one of the scooters, you simply have to download the corresponding app, enter your credit card information, and submit of photo of your driver's license. The app will then help you locate the scooters closest to you. So far, the city and Tampa police say no serious injuries have been reported in connection with e-scooters.",https://www.fox13news.com/news/some-scooter-riders-arent-playing-by-the-rules-in-downtown-tampa
We tried to cross downtown Tampa via scooter. Here's how it went.,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,6,5,"We tried to cross downtown Tampa via scooter. Here's how it went. Someday, when we contemplate the history of Tampa's downtown, we will think of it in two eras. There was the time before scooters — Tampa's B.S. period. And there was the enchanting post-scooter age that came after. Or maybe the city's yearlong trial to assess the viability of motorized, dockless, shared scooters will end and we'll stick the scooters wherever we put all the fidget spinners. We'll promise never to speak of this again. The future can't be seen. What I did see over the weekend was downtown Tampa on a sweaty Saturday where scooter-sharing was The Thing. Everyone seemed to be talking about it or attempting it, even if they were not actually doing it. The scooters arrived quietly (they are electric, after all) and under cover of darkness over Memorial Day weekend. They instantly became a favored topic in local media. Thousands of people rode them, some in forbidden areas such as the Riverwalk. We did not learn if they were fun or worth the cost, which is what I went to downtown to find out. Tampa is getting more residents, restaurants and entertainment options. Traffic and parking are as bad as ever. The scooters are part of an evolving mix of balms meant to ease Tampa's car-centric pains. Coast Bikes arrived a few years ago. Then came the Cross-Bay Ferry. Tampa's TECO Streetcar became free in the fall in an effort to boost ridership. Scooters could be a ""last-mile"" option that can tie other methods of transport together. Along with my girlfriend Tyler Killette, my co-worker Meaghan Habuda and her boyfriend Chris Fasick, the goal was to travel from Armature Works in Tampa Heights to Sparkman Wharf in the Water Street district with a stop at GenX Tavern in downtown proper. Yes, we would take the trendy, new transport to the three trendiest places in range to decide if it was good or even possible. Before our trip, we enjoyed a round of expensive craft beers at Armature Works and asked each other questions: Who are these scooters really for? Serious commuters or people just screwing around? Both, we guessed, but on that Saturday it felt like the second one. Do you have to know how to ride one in order to ride one safely? Having once jumped a Razor scooter into a swimming pool of green water and dead leaves on a dare, I felt somewhat experienced. But others were a little nervous. Do you have to wear a helmet? Not by law, but the scooter apps do remind you that it would be a good idea. No helmets were spotted on Saturday. Can you get a DUI on a motorized, dockless, shared scooter? It's possible, but while I have no idea if anyone in Tampa was drinking too much before scooting that day, many people at Armature Works were having drinks, and many people were getting on scooters. And just as I was making a note of that, a guy rode by on a scooter holding two empty beer cups in his teeth. Our group walked to the nearby scooter corral and found about a dozen scooters waiting in three varieties: Spin (owned by Ford Motor Company), Lime and Bird. On attempting to move a Spin, it made a sound like an angry Transformer, so I stopped and downloaded the app and entered a debit card. All around, people were staring at their phones doing the same, saying things that weeks earlier would have sounded insane: Should we both get a Bird? I think I'd fit better on a Lime. This Spin just yelled at me! All scooters charge varying amounts per minute, but some require you to load $5 or $10 up front. Then you scan a bar code with your phone and you're off. There are other minor differences. Some have foot brakes versus hand brakes. Some have slightly higher handlebars. Some have bells that are handy for alerting pedestrians that you're scooting up behind them on a conveyance you haven't practiced stopping. Some announce how much carbon you saved the environment at the end of your ride. Our group ended up with two Spins, a Bird and a Lime. We were cruising along for a few minutes, picking up speed, when the scooter made the Transformer sound again and slowed to a crawl. Everyone else's, too. We weren't on the forbidden Riverwalk, but we were on the sidewalk that runs parallel to the Riverwalk just a few yards away. Apparently, the scooter's GPS isn't precise enough to know the difference and had throttled us down as punishment. No big deal. We ventured farther from the forbidden zone and the scooters came back to life. Before long, we hit a downhill slope and the digital speedometer on the Bird hit 15. In a car, 15 is maddeningly glacial, but on a motorized, dockless, shared scooter it was fast enough to make a me consider my own mortality. It never felt crowded on the sidewalk with the scooters and pedestrians, though I did nearly clip a couple of empty Limes with my Bird near a parking garage by the Straz Center. They were just sitting there like their riders had been raptured mid-ride to a Curtis Hixon margarita fest in the sky. It is clear the landscape of downtown has already changed. Here and there, scooters sat abandoned on street corners and leaning against trees. It's not really as ugly as it is eerie. I was nearly hit by a car turning off Ashley Drive as I crossed Kennedy Boulevard. But I have been nearly hit by a car crossing that intersection on foot so many times I can't say the scooter had anything to do with it. We arrived at GenX Tavern safely in about 25 minutes, including a detour to ride through the splash pad at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park, and left the scooters on the sidewalk out front. Minutes later, we watched through the window as another group scooted away on our only rides. We knew that was a possibility. The scooters can be locked after reaching a destination — they'll show as ""in use"" — but that also keeps the meter running. We had taken our chances. We added up the cost for the first leg of the journey. We had each paid around $6 to $10 for the 1.6-mile trip, for a total of roughly $33. I checked the cost to Uber from the bar to exactly where we had started. It would have cost $7.38. We left GenX Tavern an hour later and began the great scooter tribulation of our own making. The various apps showed available scooters many blocks away, but since none looked convenient, we decided our best move would be to wander in the hot cement desert until we came across some free ones. Chris informed me that this type of search was called Bird hunting, or Lime harvesting. We could not think of a clever name for Spin. We walked south and sweated through our shirts and found a couple of Birds at MacDill Park. Dead batteries. A scooter sat lonely under an overpass. Dead. Meaghan looked toward the horizon, squinted into the sun and asked wearily, ""Is that one over there?"" A couple passed us in the opposite direction moments later and said, ""Is that one over there?"" They walked on toward the dead ones we had already checked. We found seven dead scooters before reaching Harpoon Harry's on Franklin Street, a scooter hot spot. This is, perhaps, a problem that will be resolved when the number of scooters on the streets goes from several hundred to several thousand in the coming weeks. I booted up a Spin with 16 percent battery. A guy with a large gold chain rolled up on a traffic-cone-orange variety of scooter we had not seen yet and informed me that ""you need to get one of these Jumps"" because they're ""the best,"" and also he had just started working for Jump, which is owned by Uber and is compatible with the Uber app. I stuck with the Spin. Chris ended up with a Jump. By then, he had installed and entered his credit card into four new apps in a single afternoon. This final leg of the journey is when it became clear it's nearly impossible to ride these scooters without smiling. Cruising past Fort Brooke Cotanchobee Park and the waterfront at a thoughtful pace, seeing the ongoing rise of the Water Street district from a new perspective — while moving fast enough to stay relatively cool and breezy — was lovely. ""I did not realize these were going to be so fun,"" Tyler said, and the group agreed. That made it worth the $51.47 total it took for four people to reach Sparkman Wharf from Armature Works. It was about 3.5 times what Uber would have cost. After paying for snacks at Sparkman Wharf, we were happy to wait eight minutes to get picked up by the free Downtowner for the return trip. But the scooters called to us. Late that night, after dinner at Lee's Grocery in Tampa Heights, we encountered a lone Bird on a dark, residential sidewalk. Nobody needed it for anything, but Tyler fired it up anyway and scooted down the street.",https://www.tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/we-tried-to-cross-downtown-tampa-via-scooter-heres-how-it-went-20190604/
"Scooter use grows in Tampa, but so do complaints about scooter users",Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,6,11,"Scooter use grows in Tampa, but so do complaints about scooter users. Two weeks after the city launched its experiment with allowing electric scooters to swarm sidewalks, the number of scooters is growing but so is the number of complaints. Four companies now rent scooters to Tampa riders looking for something faster than walking and easier to park than a car. To keep pace with demand, at least two are already expanding into more areas of the city. Meanwhile, though, city transportation director Jean Duncan said Monday that in addition to praise, the city has heard from residents who don't like the scooters. She said people have complained that scooter users are ""zooming too fast"" (although they are limited to 15 mph), driving in areas where they are not allowed and dumping their rides wherever they please. One video posted on Twitter over the weekend showed what appeared to be a brawl between scooter riders and a bicyclist. The Twitter user who posted it commented, ""These scooters are causing a ruckus in Tampa."" Tampa police investigated the incident, but by the time they arrived at the intersection of Willow Avenue S and Azeele Street, everyone involved had disappeared. ""Three white males on scooters were beating up a white male who (was) wearing a bike outfit,"" their report said. That appears to be the only incident of its kind reported to police. Chief Brian Dugan says so far he hasn't seen much in the way of problems from the scooter experiment. ""I think they'll be a great addition to our city, as long as we can get people trained on where to drop them off,"" he said Monday. ""We've had complaints about people leaving them in the middle of the sidewalk."" There have been no reported accidents yet, he said, ""but I'm sure it's just a matter of time."" (On Monday morning, a Tampa Bay Times photographer saw a scooter rider very nearly get run over by an Amazon delivery van.) Still, Dugan said he counts himself as a big fan of the scooters after riding one in Charlotte, N.C., last year with his 17-year-old son: ""We had an absolute blast."" So far he has not ridden any in Tampa, he said. The chief said he'd seen the most scooters in use so far Friday night, and expects to see them all over on July 4. Officials with Lime and Spin, two of the companies supplying scooters in Tampa, say they have employees patrolling the city all day and night to pick up any scooters discarded in the wrong places. They also said they are expanding into new areas of the city as quickly as possible to meet the demand they're seeing. They also have asked for more ""corrals"" for parking scooters, Duncan said. That's not something the city had planned on, so now officials are trying to figure out if they are able to — or inclined to — accommodate those requests. Unlike other cities, where the scooter companies invaded without warning, in Tampa they specifically requested city permission to start their businesses. Tampa has taken its time launching its one-year pilot program, which allows up to 2,400 scooters to operate around town. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone. There are a few zones where the city has forbidden scooters, including the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and E Seventh Avenue in Ybor City. Scooter riders also are supposed to stick to sidewalks, and avoid streets and bike paths. But that is likely to change if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs into law a bill sponsored by State Sen. Jeff Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo that allows scooters on streets and bike paths, if local governments approve. The unanswered question, Duncan said, is whether users in Tampa will begin treating the scooters as something more than a novelty. ""We're hoping it becomes a transportation choice,"" she said, ""rather than a something for entertainment.""",https://www.tampabay.com/transportation/scooter-use-grows-in-tampa-but-so-do-complaints-about-scooter-users-20190610/
Uber rolls out e-scooters in Tampa,Florida Politics,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,6,11,"Uber rolls out e-scooters in Tampa. The rides cost $0.29 a minute with no additional fee to unlock the scooters. Uber is launching a fleet of electric scooters in downtown Tampa and Ybor City Tuesday. The popular ridesharing company is rolling out its JUMP e-scooters as part of a one-year pilot testing the service. The scooters are available at 20 different locations throughout downtown Tampa and Ybor City. The rides cost 29 cents a minute with no additional fee to unlock the scooters. Riders can reserve a scooter through the Uber app by switching modes at the top of the app’s home screen to “scooter.” Riders can also scan a QR code to unlock a scooter in-person. “Riders have told us they like having multiple transportation options available within a single app to fit their various needs,” said João Barbara, UMP General Manager, Florida. “Reliability, convenience, and choice have long been key attributes of the Uber platform. With those features in mind, we’re excited to now offer access to electric scooters at the push of a button.” Uber is one of four companies providing scooters under a one-year contract. Vendors, including Uber, are each paying the city about $240,000 including a $20,000 operating fee and $365 per scooter. The companies, which also includes Bird, Lime and Spin, will keep any revenue from the pay-per-use service. Under their operating contract with the city, the companies must also provide operational data to the city to help evaluate the program’s popularity. Scooters from other companies launched late last month and have already been popular. However, there have been some challenges. Riders do not have to return the scooters to designated corals provided by each of the four companies. Instead, scooters have been spotted ditched in the middle of busy sidewalks and have been seen in use in prohibited areas like Riverwalk and Ybor City. Companies are working with the city of Tampa to iron out any kinks. Contractually, the companies must provide a liaison to work with the city to address issues as they arise, which the city says is happening. Tampa is launching an e-scooter pilot to test the significance of the small vehicles as a first-mile/last-mile transit solution and for increased mobility in the city’s densest areas. Uber launched its electric scooter offshoot JUMP last fall in what the company described as an effort to provide multiple options for affordable and reliable transportation options and reduce dependency on owning a car. The company formerly launched a dockless electric bike share program in 2017. Uber’s bikes aren’t available in Tampa, but the city does have a robust bike share network in and around downtown through Coast Bikes. As part of its launch Tuesday, Uber is offering a safety demonstration in downtown Tampa at Franklin Manor from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. Those demonstrations also include helmet give-aways.",https://floridapolitics.com/archives/298495-uber-rolls-out-e-scooters-in-tampa

RELATED: E-Scooters new way to scoot along streets of downtown Tampa Lime uses contract workers, regular people like you and me, to scour the streets for scooters low on battery or out of range and pay them to pick them up. ""I typically just drive around or just hang out and wait until they show up,"" Paul Venghaus said. Venghaus drives for Lime. If he doesn't have anything to do, he will fire up his app and try to make some extra cash. ""I'd say in a good day probably about 50 bucks an hour,"" Venghaus said. The money is all getting put into savings. Venghaus and his wife are saving as much as they can to hopefully one day open up a coffee shop. ""It's not a full-time gig,"" Venghaus said. ""It gives me the flexibility to kind of come out when I want to."" The company lingo is that Venghaus first ""harvests"" the scooters. Then takes them to his home to ""juice"" them. Once they are charged, he puts them back at their hub locations in downtown Tampa. Venghaus admits wrangling scooters lining the sidewalks has made for an exciting side job. ""One day I was loading them, and a guy was walking, and he stopped and asked me if I was stealing all the scooters,"" Venghaus said. ""It's kind of like I feel like the Grinch that stole the scooters."" Venghaus earns $4 per scooter that needs a charge and $2 to move them back into their hubs in Tampa.

Tampa lifts restrictions on e-scooter riding areas,Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,6,20,"Tampa lifts restrictions on e-scooter riding areas. Electric scooter riders in Tampa are now free to ride on the city streets and bike lanes. Gov. Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 453, Micromobility Devices this week, allowing e-scooters to be treated as bikes, but allows the county or municipality to regulate the operation of micromobility devices. Although municipalities can have home rule and make restrictions tighter, Tampa is standing by the new law, allowing scooters to ride in previously restricted areas. However, e-scooters are still restricted on theTampa Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City, according to a city spokeswoman. The e-scooter program rolled out in Tampa in late May and people were abandoning scooters in areas that are not corrals and people have been seen riding them on the Riverwalk and in the middle of streets. The number of e-scooters zipping through Tampa can grow up to a total of 2,400 with the four vendors — Bird, Lime, Spin and JUMP. City officials in Clearwater have been watching the bill as well as the issues that surfaced early on in Tampa's program and therefore passed a moratorium. The council wanted to put a hold on not allowing scooters for the 180-day period so they have time to discuss launching a pilot program, implementing a full program or completely restricting e-scooter operators.",https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2019/06/20/tampa-lifts-restrictions-on-e-scooter-riding-areas.html

She says the scooters would be cool to have down there. The proposal just went through the Housing, Land Use & Transportation Committee Thursday. It would like to bring 750 to 1,500 of the lightweight, cheaper mode of transportation to St. Pete. They would kick off with a one year pilot program, which would renew for three more years if it’s successful. ""It’s really hard to find a parking spot around here, I think for that it would be great,” said Nicole Whitehead, who lives downtown. But, not everyone is ready to scoot. ""They’re dangerous,” said Vivian Herrington, who worries they’ll ruin the vibe of St. Pete. ""To have them littered all over the sidewalks, sometimes they don’t pick them up quick enough."" The proposed rules wouldn’t allow you to ride the scooter on sidewalks or really anywhere near the water.

Uber offers electric scooters through the app,WTSP,CBS,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,7,2,"Uber offers electric scooters through the app. Want to hop on a scooter and ride it around town? You can now do that through the Uber app. Uber has provided another way for people to get around town, this time on two wheels. JUMP electric scooters are available in Tampa through the Uber app and give riders the ability to both reserve and walk up and ride a scooter. Once riders discover their scooter of choice, they can scan the QR code through the Uber app to unlock it. All the rider has to do is kick off the ground three times to get the scooter going, pressing the throttle to boost anywhere up to 15 mph. The brake, located on the left handlebar, can be used to slow down, or riders can use the rear brake to come to a more immediate stop. The app also shows riders how charged the scooter is and how far it can be ridden before it dies and needs to be recharged again. In the Uber app, riders are advised to use a helmet, follow traffic laws and park near a bike rack in the parking zone. The app also offers discounted prices through helmet companies for riders who do not own a helmet. Click here for more safety tips about riding on the JUMP electric scooters. The scooters are available in 13 U.S. cities and in three different cities around the world, including Madrid, Paris, and Wellington. Click here to see a full list of available locations. Tampa now has four different motorized scooters to cruise around downtown. Besides Jump, there are Bird, Lime and Spin. They're part of a year-long pilot program to offer low-cost transportation and reduce traffic. The program has had a few hiccups. It had a delayed start, and some riders have not done a good job of putting the e-scooters back where they belong. Nashville City Council is considering banning them or creating more restrictions after a 26-year-old man was hit by a car while riding one back in May. There was also a similar incident in Downtown Tampa. Police say somehow a rider veered into the path of a semi truck, and he later died. 10News asked Tampa Mayor Jane Castor if she thinks changes are needed. “With any new program, there is a learning curve or a timeframe, and we’re going through that right now in the city of Tampa,” Castor said. The mayor says she thinks this is something that can be safely integrated into the community. A big part of making the e-scooter program a success is knowing the rules before you ride.

St. Petersburg scooting wisely on scooters | Editorial,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,7,12,"St. Petersburg scooting wisely on scooters. St. Petersburg has been smart to take a cautious approach to adding electric scooters to the city's transportation mix. The extra time has given city officials a better understanding of what's worked and what hasn't when other cities, including Tampa, rolled out their rental programs. That should help St. Petersburg avoid — or at least mitigate — a few of the common headaches when its scooter fleet hits the streets later this year. Any city trying to promote more transportation options and attract millennials understandably feels obligated to give scooters a try. They can help with the ""first mile, last mile"" challenge of linking residents to other transit options such as buses. They are less work than riding a rental bike, which can make them attractive during the sweaty summer months. But they can cause problems. When the Tampa program launched in May, users rode into banned areas and parked the scooters across sidewalks and entry ways. St. Petersburg is still crafting its scooter ordinance, but the plan at this point is to keep them off the city's sidewalks. That makes sense, especially downtown where the sidewalks are often congested with pedestrians. The city will have to keep a close watch on how well scooter riders interact with drivers and cyclists, and any contract with the scooter companies should include enough wiggle room to make improvements or scuttle the program if it proves too burdensome.",https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/st-petersburg-scooting-wisely-on-scooters-editorial-20190712/
"City Council airs complaints about scooters, but signals support: 'I want to see this succeed'",Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,8,1,"City Council airs complaints about scooters, but signals support: 'I want to see this succeed'. People don't always follow Tampa's electric scooter rules, but the City Council is okay with that. For now. ""I want to see this succeed,"" said council member Joseph Citro. ""This is going to be big for the city of Tampa."" Since Tampa's pilot scooter program launched May 25, the city staff has recorded 230,000 scooter trips, said Jean Duncan, director of transportation and stormwater services. Over the same period, 97 complaints about scooter use have been filed with the city, she said — not counting those made directly to members of the City Council. Thirty of the 97 were lodged by one person. ""I think it's going very well,"" Duncan said after a discussion before the council Thursday where members addressed their concerns with the companies that operate the scooters. ""We saw what happened in other cities, where people were getting so frustrated they were throwing scooters off balconies."" Many complaints in Tampa arise from finding scooters abandoned outside designated parking areas, called corrals, city officials say. Complaints sent to City Council members include drunk people riding scooters, young kids speeding around on them, and scooter use in banned areas like the Tampa Riverwalk. The city found one scooter floating in the Hillsborough River near the Cass Street Bridge. Council chairman Luis Viera, saying he's a strong supporter of the pilot program, said it's a pilot program for a reason. ""If we find out ultimately there is more good than bad, we'll continue,"" Viera said. ""If there's more bad than good, then we'll shut it down."" The pilot program ends in April 2020. Most council members echoed Viera's support for the pilot program, saying it's important for Tampa to iron out issues now so scooters can be a safe alternative transportation option. They had a range of questions Thursday for Duncan and the scooter companies. All four operating in Tampa were present — Bird, Jump, Lime and Spin. Council member John Dingfelder asked Duncan if the city is keeping track of the number of scooter riders injured. She said no, because it's difficult to collect the data. He urged her to investigate, and after the meeting, Duncan told a reporter her department may look to other cities to see how they collected the information. Council member Charlie Miranda asked city staff if they can identify improperly abandoned scooters through an app. The answer was no. ""Part of the success will be user education,"" Duncan said. Scooters are still a fun new ""toy"" for many people, she said. Teaching people how to safely use them is key. The scooter companies have promised to address the abandonment issue, she said. ""We've seen an improvement in behavior on the road,"" said Javi Correoso, a Jump spokesman. ""We have a team on the ground that is not only educating riders on safety and rules, but giving out helmets."" Jump is also planning to fine people $25 if they leave scooters outside the city-designated ride zone, Correoso said.

Are scooters smart transit option or public menace? | Editorial,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,8,12,"Are scooters smart transit option or public menace? Electric scooters are popular in growing cities because they offer a convenient way to navigate downtowns and complete short trips — the so-called ""first-mile/last mile"" connections that ease the need for a car. But scooters also can be public menaces, with riders zipping along recklessly and abandoning the vehicles on roadways, sidewalks and private property. Tampa needs to get a grip on these operations, and St. Petersburg needs an orderly approach as it looks to welcome scooters later this year. Tampa's mixed record with its scooter pilot project was on display again recently, when city council members addressed their concerns. Since the program launched in May, city staff recorded 230,000 trips, according to Jean Duncan, the city's director of transportation and stormwater. Over that period, she said, 97 complaints have been filed with the city, not counting those made directly to council members. A third of the complaints were lodged by a single person. ""I think it's going very well,"" Duncan said after the discussion. Going very well? Frustrated Tampa residents might not be throwing scooters off bridges, as has happened in other cities. But there still are widespread problems. Residents have complained of scooter drivers riding drunk, of children driving illegally, of scooters being driven in banned areas and of drivers nearly mowing down pedestrians. The companies have cracked down on scooters in no-ride zones and promised to better address abandoned vehicles. But these growing pains cannot become accepted as tolerable behavior or a standard business practice. Council members are rightly still supportive of the experiment, which ends in April. But city officials need to hold the four scooter companies more accountable. They need to better educate riders on safety, traffic regulations and operating etiquette. Tampa police already have plenty to do, but they should crack down on reckless drivers who put themselves and the public at risk. Personal responsibility also plays a part. Riders should be aware of traffic regulations and follow the requirement that they yield to pedestrians. St. Petersburg's proposed one-year experiment would put 750 to 1,500 scooters on the streets by late fall or early winter. If approved, St. Petersburg — unlike Tampa — would ban scooters from sidewalks. Parents must realize that these motorized vehicles, which travel at up to 15 mph, are not children's toys; operators in Tampa must be at least 16 years old and have a valid driver's license or permit. Some riders in Tampa appear far younger. Scooters are, for many, an ideal ""first-mile, last-mile"" solution — providing a shared vehicle and a quick, cheap commuting option for short distances. They could be a critical link between bus and rail lines in Florida's humid weather, and a tool for reducing downtown congestion and the region's carbon footprint. Riders in Tampa like the experience, and the scooters add to the city's lively image. But this is still an experiment, and it's time to better marry fun and convenience with public safety.

"Tampa council asks, ‘How many get hurt on scooters?’ Good luck finding the answer.",Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,8,23,"Tampa council asks, ‘How many get hurt on scooters?’ Good luck finding the answer. Tampa General Hospital has treated scooter-related sprained ankles and head injuries, but city leaders are grasping for accurate numbers. As scooter trips grow to more than 250,000 in Tampa, so have concerns over safety. Earlier this month, City Council members praised the city’s scooter program while at the same time peppering staff for injury data and safety concerns. “It’s definitely fun when they go fast, but boy, I hit a bump and almost fell and bumped myself,” said City Council member John Dingfelder. Transportation director Jean Duncan told the council that finding the data isn’t easy: “We don’t always know about those injuries — unless it’s something, of course, unfortunately very horrific."" Others are finding a way. And data is beginning to trickle in for Tampa. A Consumer Reports investigation published in February revealed that more than 1,500 people had been injured in electric-scooter related accidents since 2017. A Centers for Disease Control report out of Austin identified 271 people with potential scooter-related injuries during a three month period. Here in Tampa, Dr. David Wein, director of emergency medicine, said Tampa General Hospital has been tracking scooter-related injuries and sharing the data with Tampa Police Department. People have come in with sprained ankles, bruises, concussions and other injuries. Wein said the hospital has seen “a fair amount” of scooter-injuries resulting from collisions with cars. A handful of injuries happened when people rode scooters while intoxicated. Still, providing exact numbers is complicated, especially since the word “scooter” can include everything from medical scooters to mopeds. Wein says the most accurate way to track data is comparing year-over-year the number of medical reports that include a scooter reference. May and June 2018 saw seven related scooter injuries in Tampa. Scooters were rolled out over Memorial Day weekend and that number rose to 43 this year. There’s no way to know for sure if the scooters are the reason, Wein said. Medical journals publish studies, local governments monitor headlines and scooter companies track their own data, but a centralized, comprehensive source of data on scooter injuries remains elusive. Instead, transportation officials are left cobbling together reports from a number of sources. Unless a scooter accident involves a hospital or law enforcement, it’s difficult to find records. There have been discussions about creating a new category for e-scooters in police reports, said Tampa Police Department spokesperson Steve Hegarty. The city’s transportation department hopes to get preliminary accident data around the end of the scooter pilot program in May, from emergency rooms, the police department and the scooter companies themselves, Duncan said. Tampa is working with the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida and a formal report is expected around July, said center Prof. Yu Zhang. The center is also evaluating the scooter program overall, assessing the frequency, severity and causes of scooter collisions, as well as the percentage of vehicles illegally parked and the program’s economic and environmental impact. Duncan expects the year-long pilot program will be extended next year when the pilot ends. Safety concerns emerge in complaints the city is receiving directly about the scooter program — scooters racing between pedestrians, a number of people riding a scooter at the same time, bicycles colliding with scooters left on sidewalks. Still, the city isn’t taking advantage of information on complaints and injuries from the four competing vendors — Bird, Lime, Jump and Spin — even though its operating agreement allows it to. City bicycle and pedestrian engineer Calvin Thornton said that level of detail is not necessary. However, the city does ask for information on usage, performance and ridership. Thornton said he doubts people would report their own injuries and accidents in the app since it would make them liable for damages to the scooter. For now, staff at Tampa General Hospital at downtown’s southern edge seem to be among those best informed on scooter safety. The sudden popularity of scooters may be unprecedented among transportation options, Wein said. “We’ve had a whole body of literature published about (scooters) at this point already,” he said. Broken bones and head injuries are the most common scooter injuries the hospital has seen this summer. Head injuries are the most serious Wein said, so he advises wearing a helmet. But riders must bring their own. They’re not part of the on-demand scooter rentals.

Clearwater could be the next city in Tampa Bay to add electric scooters to the downtown area. City leaders are expected to vote in November on a one year pilot program for the rental scooters. The city is making some strict rules to go along with the micro-scooter launch including: They won't be allowed on sidewalks, which is something Clearwater decided after seeing some of the issues scooters are causing with pedestrians in Tampa, they will only go up to 15 mph fast, they will only be allowed on streets where the speed limit is less than 30 mph or less. The scooters will also only work in the downtown area and will turn off once they leave the GPS boundaries. Clearwater would also restrict the rented electric scooters to adults older than 18. The decision to move forward on creating a pilot program comes after the city passed a 6-month moratorium on the scooters back in June. City leaders wanted time to brainstorm and research the idea. The scooters work similar to docked rental bikes. When a rider finds a scooter, they can open the app on their phone, and scan the QR code to unlock the scooter and start riding. Most companies charge $1 to unlock the scooter. From there, it costs between 10 to 30 cents per minute. Clearwater is also looking into a central corral area for the scooters to be placed, rather than having the scooters littered around the ground and street waiting for the next rider. Florida lawmakers have also added their own rules to dictate how electric scooters are used. House Bill 453, signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis in June, gives electric scooter riders the same right as bicyclists. City leaders believe the scooters could help bring more business downtown, especially as they plan a redesign of the downtown waterfront called Imagine Clearwater. “All of that will be enhanced by the ability to just jump on a scooter and go a couple blocks without having to find your car and find a new parking spot and things like that,” explained Richard Hartman, Clearwater's transportation planner. The idea of bringing the scooters to downtown Clearwater has residents divided. Savannah Ryder lives and works in downtown Clearwater and loves the idea. ""There’s not a lot of parking in this area and I think with these scooters it would be a better way to make money, a better way to commute and just all around a good idea,” she added. Mark Wallace thinks it's too dangerous. “To put these in a crowded pedestrian area with heavy traffic, I just don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said. If the pilot program goes well in the downtown area, Clearwater could look into expanding it to the beach area.

St. Pete City Council takes major step toward implementing e-scooters,Tampa Bay Business Journal,The Business Journal,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,10,3,"St. Pete City Council takes major step toward implementing e-scooters. The city of St. Petersburg is moving forward with rolling out a pilot program for e-scooters by 2020. The city council voted 6-1, with councilman Steve Kornell being the sole no vote, to pass an ordinance amending the St. Petersburg city code by adding a new article to define micromobility, create regulations and licensing requirements for e-scooters, and regulate hoverboards. St. Pete's housing, land use and transportation committee unanimously voted to move forward with implementing an e-scooter pilot program, which had to be sent to the city council for a decision. Kornell had e-scooter safety concerns. ""I get that it's good for people on the sidewalk, but I'm not sure if it's good for the e-scooter [riders being] next to a car,"" he said during the Thursday meeting, as the city's language indicates e-scooters are prohibited from riding on certain areas that could interfere with pedestrians. Riding scooters would be prohibited on the Pinellas Trail west of 34th Street, and all waterfront trails would be prohibited on the North Bay Trail from Demen's Landing to Coffee Pot Park. They would also be banned at the Pier District and sidewalks except for the purposes of parking, and when parking and must not obstruct a building entrance or pedestrian walkway. The scooters would be able to be parked on the sidewalk in designated corrals; the type of corral hasn't been determined. However, hoverboards, which are considered motorized toys, can be ridden on certain sidewalks. Transportation and Parking Management Director Evan Mory said vendors may use geofencing to enforce good behavior on e-scooters to stop the use of them in prohibited areas. There is also an age restriction. No one under 16 years of age is permitted to ride a motorized scooter. A public hearing and second reading will take place on Oct. 17. Mory said he anticipates there to be two to three vendors when the city is ready to advertise a request for proposals for vendors to submit bids. Tampa started its e-scooter pilot program earlier this year with four vendors. Although there have been some issues and concerns, there have been more than 50,000 trips taken on the device.",https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2019/10/03/st-pete-city-council-takes-major-step-toward.html
Scooters will be coming to St. Pete. Scoot wisely. | Editorial,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,10,11,"Scooters will be coming to St. Pete. Scoot wisely. The City Council’s proposed ordinance sets reasonable restrictions that should improve safety. St. Petersburg is moving closer to embracing motorized scooters with a new ordinance on micromobility that the City Council appears poised to pass Thursday. After the messy roll-out of Tampa’s scooter program, there is reason to pay attention to and learn from those lessons. But the detailed restrictions and specific guidelines outlined in the ordinance offer hope that St. Peterburg’s scooter share system could kick off more smoothly and be more of an asset than an irritant. Scooter riders ought to honor this mantra: “If used correctly, trouble will not ensue.” Across the country, scooters have caused public complaints and even deaths. But St. Peterburg’s strict proposed regulations provide a chance to reduce complaints and improve safety. Users will have to be 16 years old to use a scooter and can travel up to a maximum speed of 15 miles per hour. Scooters will not be allowed on public sidewalks or walkways. They will only be used in bike lanes, or on streets with a speed limit of 30 miles per hour or less, which covers most downtown streets. Certain areas of St. Petersburg will be off limits for scooters, like waterfront area from Demen’s Landing to Coffee Pot Park and the Pinellas Trail west of 34th Street. Motorized scooters have the potential to be a safe, viable form of public transportation. St. Petersburg City Council members have often referenced the “first mile, last mile” phenomenon of transit, when someone may return home using public transportation to a stop that is too far from their house to travel on foot. The city plans to install about one scooter station per block in the most dense areas of the city and every one-eighth of a mile in less populated pockets. That strategy should allow for convenient scooter access for much of the city’s residents. Still, it’s important to note that St. Petersburg has already introduced a bike share program to modest success. There are an average of 150 rides a day on roughly 300 bikes docked around the city. City officials have already encountered differing opinions on the controversial transportation tools. One debate centered on how late to keep scooters running. Those at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg noted that students liked to use them late at night, while downtown leaders asked for earlier end times. The city has settled on 10 p.m. as a stop time for scooters, which is not in the ordinance but will be a contractual requirement with scooter vendors. That choice will likely prove safer for city residents. Although initial indications are positive, questions still remain about St. Pete’s scooter share roll-out. The city has yet to begin their bidding process for scooter vendors and their timeline is undefined. Scooters may be in the city early next year, but a previous city presentation said the city hoped to have had an ordinance approved and a bid process out by now. The City Council should move forward Thursday with this ordinance and be prepared to make adjustments as St. Petersburg adjusts to scooters.",https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2019/10/11/scooters-will-be-coming-to-st-pete-scoot-wisely-editorial/
What happens if you destroy a scooter in Tampa?,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,10,15,"What happens if you destroy a scooter in Tampa? Plus the most bizarre incidents of electric scooter vandalism around the city. Electric scooter destruction is not new. Ever since the transportation trend caught on, people have found all sorts of methods to deface and destroy these devices. There are even entire Instagram accounts dedicated to showcasing the most creative attacks. Florida is not immune to this movement. More than 140 electric scooters have been vandalized by one Fort Lauderdale man since April, according to a statement released by Fort Lauderdale police. On Sept. 29, Fort Lauderdale police arrested Randall Thomas Williams, 59, after a surveillance camera captured him cutting the brake lines of e-scooters around his neighborhood, the Sun-Sentinel reported. After this story made national news, we wondered: How is Tampa treating its scooters? How is Tampa trying to limit scooter shenanigans? Tampa rolled out its pilot scooter program in May and is approaching half a million rides, said Calvin Thornton, an engineer at Tampa’s Transportation and Stormwater Services Department. Four scooter companies — Lime, Bird, Jump and Spin — each paid the city a $20,000 fee, plus $1 per day per scooter. “In learning about some the other challenges cities have had, we’ve modeled our program a little bit differently,"" Thornton said. Tampa allows each company to leave up to 600 scooters on the streets at a time, meaning the most scooters the city will have out at any time is 2,400. All four brands restrict where riders can use their devices. Some examples include the University of Tampa campus and the sidewalks along 7th Avenue in Ybor and Bayshore Boulevard. What happens if you vandalize a scooter? Tampering with a scooter — including using graffiti, breaking off parts or executing other destructive acts — can count as criminal mischief. Under this charge, property damage under $200 is a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by at least 60 days in jail. Property damage between $200 and $1,000 is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable with up to one year in jail. And property damage exceeding $1,000 is a third-degree felony that can result in up to five years in prison. Scooter costs vary by brand, but the average retail price per device ranges between about $100 and $500, according to a report by Vox. A vandalism attempt on multiple scooters can easily add up to get into the felony range. Tampa’s most bizarre scooter sabotages Despite Tampa planning a scooter program that reduces mischief — and the threat of jail time — scooter destruction has still been documented around the city. Here are three examples from Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan. 1. Spray painting the QR codes Riders scan a QR code with a phone app that is used to activate a scooter and signal the end of their journey. Duncan received reports that someone painted over QR codes on about 50 Lime and Spin scooters. 2. Seeing if Birds can really fly Duncan’s office received word that someone was flinging scooters off the top of the William F. Poe parking garage on 800 N Ashley Drive. Of all four brands, only Birds were subjected to this treatment. 3. Drowning Scooter riding is prohibited along Tampa’s Riverwalk. Still, at least one e-scooter met its watery demise after being tossed into the Hillsborough River, according to a report Duncan received.

Getting Answers: St. Pete's Scooter Rules Different from Tampa,Bay News,Spectrum News,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,10,18,"Getting Answers: St. Pete's Scooter Rules Different from Tampa. ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Now that St. Petersburg is getting its own scooter pilot program in late March, what will it look like compared with Tampa? St. Pete to launch scooter pilot program in 2020 St. Pete's rules are different from Tampa's program Both cities look to track ridership data to make changes Initially, riders on one side of Tampa Bay will need to follow different regulations from the other. Reading the city ordinances, Tampa is treating scooters like pedestrians. St. Pete, by contrast, is treating scooters more like vehicles. For example, St. Pete, scooters are not allowed on sidewalks. In Tampa they are allowed on sidewalks. St. Pete will require scooters to be parked at designated corrals. Fines would go out to riders for not complying. The scooter companies will do the enforcement. St. Pete law enforcement will get involved for obvious road violations like riding on the wrong side of a one way street. Tampa is also handing out fines for these clear violations. But after speaking to both Tampa and St. Pete’s transportation directors, officials want to incentivize riders on good behavior. They said they’re not looking to make it a business of fining riders. But if someone has multiple infractions, eventually they would lose their privileges. For perspective, Tampa provided September’s violations on no ride zones. Another big difference between Tampa and St. Pete: the Sunshine City will implement a 10 p.m. curfew. Officials said it could be changed to an even earlier deadline if they find riders are having more road violations as they come closer to the curfew deadline. In Tampa, there's no such language. St. Pete’s pilot program is for 18 year olds and up unless you own your own scooter, in which case the age minimum lowers to 16. Tampa's program allows for 16 year olds to participate in the ride share program. Both programs will have restrictions on where scooters are allowed. They are prohibited on St. Pete’s Waterfront Trail, Tampa’s Bayshore Boulevard, Riverwalk, and Ybor's 7th Avenue. In addition, St. Pete will let you ride in bike lanes on streets with higher speed limits. But if there's no bike lane, scooters are banned on streets that have speed limits of 35 miles per hour or higher. In St. Pete scooter use is allowed on the Pinellas Trail within city limits or east of 34th St. Both cities’ programs encourage helmets but are not required. Finally, speeds shall not exceed 15 miles per hour and neither city allows double riding.",https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2019/10/18/getting-answers--st--pete-s-scooter-rules-different-from-tampa-s
St. Petersburg is getting scooters. But there will be rules.,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2019,10,18,"St. Petersburg is getting scooters. But there will be rules. The city wants to avoid other cities’ mistakes. Scooters will not be allowed on sidewalks and must be parked in designated corrals. Scooters are coming to the Sunshine City in 2020, but not without a detailed set of rules and restrictions. The City Council approved an ordinance Thursday that would allow scooter share companies like Bird and Lime to participate in a one-year pilot program that could start around March. But after months of studying similar programs in Tampa, Atlanta and other cities nationwide, city staff has come up with a list of restrictions that they hope will set St. Petersburg’s scooter program apart from the others: Scooters will not be allowed on sidewalks. They can be ridden in the street if the speed limit is 30 mph or less or in bike lanes on higher speed streets. People will be prohibited from riding scooters on the city’s waterfront trail, which staff said is already overcrowded. Riders will be required to park scooters in designated corrals, instead of haphazardly leaving them at their destination. Scooters will have a 10 p.m. curfew. City staff and council members hope these regulations will help St. Petersburg launch one of the nation’s most successful programs ? and avoid some of the safety and clutter issues that have plagued scooters in other cities. But much of the success that scooters have seen in other regions is predicated on the ability for people to jump on and off of them wherever they are ? instead of worrying about finding a designated parking location or limiting the areas where they can be used. RELATED: St. Petersburg wants scooters. But it doesn’t want scooters’ problems. Council member Ed Montanari said he was all for bringing scooters to St. Petersburg, but wanted to make sure there was the right balance between regulation and ease of use. “I don’t want the Wild Wild West, and I don’t want to limit scooters to the degree where it just doesn’t make sense to use them,” Montanari said. “How do we find that balance?” The city’s transportation director, Evan Mory, told the council the proposed program won’t be perfect when it launches and will have growing pains. But he said staff is prepared to analyze data and tweak the program as it moves along. St. Petersburg hopes to do better than “cities that have woken up to find 1,000 scooters deployed without their knowledge overnight,” Mory said. ""We’re setting it up for success, and we have to be honest with ourselves that there will still be some challenges.” Council members questioned how the restrictions would work and whether it would involve fines. Mory said details on those specifics would have to wait until city staff returns to council with agreements from each of the participating companies that the members would then approve. However, he did share some idea of how scooter parking and curfew enforcement could work. City officials would likely set up one parking corral for every block downtown, Mory said, with as many as 180 such areas being set up across the city. The corrals would be marked by a white line painted on the ground and would help address concerns other cities have shared about scooters that block sidewalks, businesses and Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant ramps. Mory said scooter companies can require riders to take pictures of their parked scooter before ending a ride. If the scooter is not left inside a designated corral, those riders could be fined. Though a fine table hasn’t been set yet, Mory suggested a first offense could result in a warning, a second could cost the rider $3 to $5 and repeat offenders could see even higher fines or be blocked from using the app entirely. He’s hoping that part of regulation will be handled by the companies. “For the most part, improper parking should be something the city does not have to participate in,” Mory said. Megan Werner, owner of Brutique at 648 Central Ave., said she’s hopeful that scooters could help people explore different parts of downtown without worrying about parking. “There are so many different neighborhoods and pockets in St. Pete,” Werner said. “People don’t want to leave their comfort zones and have to stress about finding parking. “I think scooters will promote people to move from area to area so people aren’t staying only on Beach Drive or the Edge District, but feel more free to move around.” She was reassured to hear about the city’s plans to keep scooters off sidewalks — she often places tables, signs and mannequins on the sidewalk outside her store — and to implement a corral parking system. “Atlanta was the first place I had seen it completely trashed,” Werner said. “There was no rhyme or reason for where the scooters are. It takes away from the beauty of the city. I don’t want to see that happen here.” Mory said about 50 percent of cities that have scooter-sharing systems use the corrals and others, like Atlanta, have curfews in place. As for the 10 p.m. curfew, scooter companies would be able to lock the scooters at a set time, prohibiting people from starting rides late at night. Because the curfew time isn’t explicitly stated in the ordinance, Mory said that could be adjusted throughout the pilot program as problems arise. “Say at the end of the pilot, we have 10 crashes and eight of them happen between 9 and 10 p.m.,"" Mory said. ""That’s kind of a no-brainer. We’d move it back to 9 o’clock for safety reasons.” Council members Charles Gerdes and Steve Kornell voted against the ordinance. Gerdes cited safety as his main concern. “I’m going to be the 63-year-old, no-fun fuddy dud on this one,” Gerdes said, before explaining that two of his family members have crashed scooters in other cities. Similar to Tampa, Mory said he hopes the city can partner with the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida to collect and analyze data during the program, including information on crashes and injuries. Now that council has approved the ordinance, staff will issue a request for proposals and will bring those proposals back to the members next year, along with suggested companies the city could partner with. Mory said he expects the first scooter to hit the streets in late winter or early spring. “I frankly would’ve liked to see them on the street yesterday,” council member Brandi Gabbard said. “I’m glad they’re finally here.”",https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/10/18/st-peterburg-is-getting-scooters-but-there-will-be-rules/

In the darkness of the night, people wheeled several electric scooters over Channelside Drive and put them on the trolley tracks in the Channel District. 8 On Your Side learned a trolley later came by and slammed into them. Then, commercial boaters have reported seeing some e-scooters on the bottom of the Hillsborough River. “The problem is individuals adhering to the rules and regulations that the scooter program provides. And I think that’s the biggest problem,” said Tampa resident Helen Erb. The recent incidents break the rules and are also deemed vandalism. While the City of Tampa doesn’t track acts of damage to the scooters, the companies can do so. A spokesperson with Lime tells 8 On Your Side that the company pursues legal action against anyone who damages its property. Lime works with police to identify and address cases of vandalism. If Lime scooters are tossed into bodies of water, company workers fish them out. Javi Correoso, a spokesman with Uber, called 8 On Your Side and said the company has retrieved two scooters from the Hillsborough River to date. He added if a user parks a scooter in a right of way, they can be fined $25. “We get some information on these occurrences, but generally vandalism type of complaints are directed to our police department,” said Jean Duncan, director of the city’s transportation and stormwater services department. Duncan explained that acts of vandalism with the scooters are quite rare. “I would say if we crunch the numbers, the majority is everyone is behaving, being responsible, being safe. And it’s a very small fraction that’s not,” Ducan said. In the past 6 months, scooter riders in Tampa took more than 700,000 trips, city records show.

JUMP, the Uber-owned scooter company, has a monthly unlimited subscription but it is only available in Washington, D.C., Miami and San Francisco. Tampa also offers Bird and Spin electric scooters, neither which have subscription or unlimited option offerings. E-scooters were unveiled in Tampa in June. The city of Tampa recently released e-scooter data over the last six months, showing 730,000 trips have been completed. That breaks down to 856,333 miles and roughly 4,000 trips a day. The average distance was just over a mile and the average time spent on an e-scooter was 16 minutes. St. Petersburg and Clearwater are also inching toward offering e-scooters. In October, the St. Pete City Council approved a micromobility ordinance that would allow the e-scooters in the city. The program will kick off in spring 2020. And in November, Clearwater city council members agreed to have further discussions about launching a pilot program for e-scooters.",https://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2019/12/18/e-scooter-company-launches-unlimited-pass-in-tampa.html
Pirates on wheels: What you need to know about scooters at Gasparilla,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2020,1,17,"Pirates on wheels: What you need to know about scooters at Gasparilla. One company decided to pull its scooters Jan. 25 ‘out of an abundance of caution for riders and those participating in Gasparilla.’ One thing you don’t want to see at the Gasparilla parade: pirates zipping by on scooters with a drink in one hand and a flintlock in the other. But just as sure as they’ll be reveling on boats and floats, pirates will be riding scooters in some fashion. The city of Tampa plans to allow scooter companies to operate rentals Saturday, Jan. 25, during the Gasparilla parade. There’s a special added restriction this day: The no-ride zone will be expanded to include several blocks around the parade route. Scooters already are banned from the Riverwalk and Bayshore Boulevard. Officials are concerned about clutter, safety and alcohol consumption, but decided against banning scooter use, Tampa transportation director Jean Duncan said. “We’ve never had scooters around during Gasparilla before, so it’s sort of an experiment, so to speak,” Duncan said. “We want to have as many multi-modal options for people as possible.” Getting to the parade site — and then moving around once you’re there — can be a logistical nightmare. Roads are closed. Parking is scarce. The cost of a ride with Uber and Lyft rises with demand. These factors helped make the case to allow scooters and other modes of transportation so people can choose to ditch their cars. And Tampa has shown a clear appetite for this newest of transportation fads: People have logged more than 818,000 trips on scooters during the first seven months of a city pilot program. But scooters at Gasparilla present unique concerns. People will drop their rental rides along already crowded paths crammed with bead-catchers and partygoers. And the event’s open-container policy allows alcohol along the parade route. “The population that tends to use these is likely the population that will be drinking and partying,” Duncan said. Scooter companies, like Jump, warn users that it’s a violation of the rental agreement to operate a scooter while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. “If you had a few drinks, let someone else be the captain of the ship by requesting an Uber,” said Javi Correoso, spokesman for Jump, which is owned by Uber. Bird decided to pull its scooters off the streets for the event and will not operate Jan. 25. The company has adjusted its operations in other cities during large special events like parades, concerts and festivals. “Safety is our number one priority at Bird and out of an abundance of caution for riders and those participating in Gasparilla, we won’t be operating,” a statement from Bird said. The city plans to test its event protocol for scooters during the Gasparilla children’s parade on Saturday. The extended no-ride zone will be in effect, banning scooters from Bayshore Boulevard to the Selmon Expressway south of Morrison Avenue. From Morrison, the no-ride zone zig-zags north-east to downtown, with Cass Street, Florida Avenue and the water as boundaries. City staff will use Saturday’s experience to decide whether to adjust the rules or the no-ride zone for the main parade the following Saturday. Because so many people attend the parade, the city is concerned about scooter batteries dying mid-day and users abandoning them in crowded areas. And companies might not be able to pick up the dead scooters until after the event because of road closures. The added clutter could lead to accidents, or at least annoyed visitors. Scooter companies are trying to avoid that. “We will be operating with an increased reserve of scooters, charging capacity and staff in order to replace drained scooters with freshly charged ones promptly,” Correoso said. Spin said its workforce “will constantly be rebalancing and redeploying scooters” during the event to ensure riders have access to charged scooters.",https://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/2020/01/17/pirates-on-wheels-what-you-need-to-know-about-scooters-at-gasparilla/
Bikes vs. Scooters: Does Tampa Bay have room for both?,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2020,3,2,"Bikes vs. Scooters: Does Tampa Bay have room for both? Tampa has seen a dip in monthly bike rentals since scooters came to town, but experts say the two options complement each other rather than compete. Brace yourself, Tampa Bay: Scooter share is here and growing. But what that means for the area’s existing bike shares remains uncertain. Local cities welcomed bike shares with open arms over the last few years, while leaders were more hesitant with the electric scooter craze. Now both are in the market, and transportation officials are waiting to see how the relationship between the two “micromobility” options will shake out. Bike shares came to Tampa in 2014 via the blue Coast Bike rentals. Six years later, the program averages about 4,000 rentals per month, according to transportation director Jean Duncan. Neighboring St. Petersburg adopted its program in 2016 and just renewed the contract earlier this year. Coast Bike riders have taken nearly 116,000 trips since February 2017 and traveled more than 241,000 miles on the rental bikes, city data shows. But those numbers are poised to change now that electric, dockless scooters are entering the mix. The impact of scooters on bike shares looks different in each market. In Denver, the explosion of e-scooter use preceded the city’s bike share nonprofit shutting its doors for good last month as the city recrafts its vision for bike and scooter shares. In Portland, the two have co-existed a little more peacefully, with early numbers even showing that bike share numbers continued to grow. Now that Tampa Bay is finally jumping into the scooter game, a little belatedly compared to other cities, local transportation directors are eager to see how their numbers pan out. “I think on people’s minds is whether we even need bike share anymore because we’re going to become a scooter city,” St. Petersburg transportation director Evan Mory said. “There’s room for both. We want people to still have an active transportation option.” Scooters invaded dozens of cities in 2018 — sometimes overnight and with little to no warning. While those regions spent much of the year determining if and how to allow scooters into their downtowns, Florida has stayed out of the mix. That’s because many local governments interpreted current Florida law as prohibiting scooter companies like Lime and Bird from entering their markets unless an ordinance exists. But transportation departments slowly got on board, taking care to learn from successes and failures elsewhere. Tampa launched its pilot project in May, and has seen more than 900,000 scooter rentals in the first eight months. St. Petersburg is in the final stages of finalizing its pilot. If City Council members approve the measure, people can expect to see scooters on the streets in April or May. Tampa’s annual numbers for bike share continue to rise. In 2015, the first full year of bike share, the city logged close to 48,000 trips. That number grew to about 58,000 in 2018 and peaked at 62,500 in 2019. But looking more closely at that data, there’s a clear distinction between the pre- and post-scooter periods of 2019. In the first five months of the year, bike share was averaging about 6,700 trips per month. Once scooters were introduced, that monthly average dropped to 3,600. “It looks like since the scooter program began, bike share numbers have tapered off,” said Vik Bhide with the city’s transportation department. But he added: “We will always have both a bike share and a scooter share program. There’s no doubt about that.” While some fear the possible competition, transportation experts are quick to explain the different purposes the two modes serve. Early data across multiple cities show that bikes tend to be used more for longer commuting trips and by those seeking a more active transportation mode. Scooters fill the niche for shorter, entertainment-based trips. Those initial findings are shifting, though, as scooters become more commonplace and the novelty wears off, said Nick Williams, who oversees bike and scooter shares in Denver’s department of transportation. Early numbers show that average scooter trips started out under a mile per trip and then slowly crept up to 1.1 or 1.2 miles per trip. Bike shares averaged between 1.7 and 2.1 miles per trip, Williams said. “Scooters, especially in the beginning, are used for more recreational trips than pure commuting,” Williams said. “I think that is shifting, and I think that’s partly why you’re seeing the mileage move up.” Dylan Rivera, spokesman for Portland’s bureau of transportation, said the city is less concerned with which mode riders chose than the overall goal of reducing one-person car trips. “We think, in general, there’s a lot of potential overlap for those two options to work well together to overall increase active transportation in the city,” Rivera said. “We’re trying to decrease drive-alone trips,"" he said. ""If we can do that with biking, if we can do that with e-scooters, if we can do that with public transit, if we can do that with carpooling, we think that’s great.” ",https://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/2020/03/02/bikes-vs-scooters-does-tampa-bay-have-room-for-both/
Is it safe to ride e-scooters under a 'safer-at-home' order?,WTSP,CBS,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2020,3,26,"Is it safe to ride e-scooters under a 'safer-at-home' order? The city of Tampa says it's up to each e-scooter company to disinfect the scooters. As stay-at-home and safer-at-home orders are enacted in cities, counties and states, many still worry about the safety of going outside for some fresh air. E-scooters, popular in the city of Tampa, are still one way to get exercise in while social distancing. The city said it's up to the companies who own the scooters to disinfect them. Tampa works with four vendors for its e-scooters: Lime, Bird, Jump and Spin. Lime said it has suspended all service of its e-scooters. 10News also reached out to Jump, which is owned by Uber, for more details about keeping e-scooters safe and clean during the coronavirus pandemic. Both Bird and Spin said they have increased the frequency of daily cleaning and sanitizing, including sterilizing helmets. Bird said it's providing extra gloves for field staff as well as hand sanitizer. Spin said all ""high-traffic"" surfaces at warehouses and in the field must be disinfected daily. Tampa mayor's office spokesperson Ashley Bauman said that yes, even with a safer-at-home order in place, residents can still use e-scooters as long as they practice social distancing. On Thursday, Hillsborough County leaders approved a ""safer-at-home"" order to combat the spread of COVID-19. The order goes into effect at 10 p.m. Friday, March 27. There are exceptions for ""essential services."" That includes going to the grocery store, the doctor's office and the pharmacy. People who live in the county are also allowed to leave their home for exercise but are strongly urged to remain at least six feet away from others.",https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/hillsboroughcounty/tampa-escooter-disinfecting-products-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/67-ec6536b6-db05-4811-8859-708c244dfd5b
Scooters are back on Tampa streets after coronavirus shelved them for seven weeks,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2020,7,24,"Scooters are back on Tampa streets after coronavirus shelved them for seven weeks. St. Petersburg hopes to launch its own pilot in the fall. Scooters are back on Tampa streets after a 7-week absence prompted by coronavirus concerns. Lime, Spin and Bird relaunched Wednesday and are deploying more scooters over the course of the next week. The companies were told to pull their vehicles on May 31 as the novel coronavirus continued to spread through Tampa Bay in the spring. Providers are touting their electric, shared scooters as a safer alternative to buses and rideshares. “You’re not close to others, you’re out in the open air,” Lime Florida General Manager Uhriel Bedoya said. “It’s a socially distanced, safe mode of transportation.” But others are concerned about the shared nature of the vehicles, how often they’re being cleaned and how they might contribute to the spread of COVID-19. “I’m not sure I’d be comfortable using one right now due to COVID,” said Michael Dominick, 32, of Riverview. “Although, to be fair, that also goes for things like Uber and Lyft as well for me right now.” Brandon Campbell, Tampa’s smart mobility manager, said city officials were monitoring COVID-19 trends and evaluating when to bring scooters back. While Tampa Bay and the state continue to see high case loads and deaths daily, Campbell said officials are hoping the mask order that was put in place will make a difference. “It’s taken a while for that to have an impact on our local numbers, but it does seem to be locally that the trend is starting to go back down,” Campbell said. “We’re cautiously optimistic that things are going to continue in the right way.” St. Petersburg is hoping to restart its efforts to launch a similar scooter pilot after COVID-19 delayed the initial timeline. Transportation and Parking Management Director Evan Mory said the city is still moving forward with its plans to bring a scooter program to St. Petersburg. He said the City Council is likely to vote on moving forward with scooter vendors in late August, which, if approved, would mean a program start as early as September. Bedoya and Will Burns, Spin’s Director of Government Partnerships East, said their respective companies have put in place new protocol to help defray risks of COVID-19 transmission. Both companies said employees wear personal protective equipment, regularly disinfect the vehicles and send notifications to riders about how they can protect themselves, such as bringing their own wipes and gloves. “We’ve adapted as a company, and I think our customers have adapted, too,” Burns said. Scooters first entered the Tampa market in May 2019 as part of a one-year pilot to see if the latest transportation trend would work here. Since then, three companies have together provided more than a million trips. The plan was to wrap up the pilot program this spring and decide if and how to make the shared transportation option in downtown and surrounding neighborhoods permanent. Then came coronavirus. The city extended its pilot program another 12 months to allow time for the pandemic to pass and things to return to normal, or close to it. Campbell said the intent is to have a permanent program in place sometime before the spring. “We keep being hopeful that we’re going to see a definitive end of the pandemic, but at some point between now and April, we’re going to have to make a decision about what our timing should be,” Campbell said. Scooter companies prefer to market their rides as real transportation solutions that help people get to jobs, appointments or the grocery store, instead of just a fun way to spend the afternoon. Both Spin and Lime referenced internal data that showed scooter use during the pandemic saw a higher percentage of trips starting and ending with essential services. Campbell referenced similar findings out of Baltimore that encouraged Tampa officials to bring scooters back online. “One thing that stood out, they saw a pretty significant change in the share of scooter trips that were either beginning or ending at grocery stores and hospitals,” Campbell said. “While their data is not going to match ours exactly, it gave us a case study to see that this is the story that happened when they kept the scooters going throughout the pandemic.”",https://www.tampabay.com/news/transportation/2020/07/24/scooters-are-back-on-tampa-streets-after-coronavirus-shelved-them-for-seven-weeks/
St. Petersburg welcomes electric scooters,Tampa Bay Times,,"Tampa Bay Area, FL",2020,8,20,"St. Petersburg welcomes electric scooters. The scooters, from companies Razor and Veo, could hit the streets in September or October. Electric scooters are on their way to St. Petersburg. City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a pilot agreement with scooter share companies Razor and Veo, who will be dropping off up to 225 scooters each in the Sunshine City. Look for them to hit the streets in September or October. Once the program is ramped up, the city could host up to 1,500 of the devices, which is about the number of scooters deployed in Tampa. However, St. Petersburg’s program is going to look different from Tampa’s and other cities across the country. Fearful of abandoned scooters strewn across St. Petersburg’s busy downtown sidewalks, the city is establishing corrals all over downtown and along Central Avenue where scooter drop-offs will be mandatory. It’s been a long journey for the alternative mode of transportation in St. Petersburg. Debate on the issue began last year, and City Council approved an ordinance to govern the operation of scooters. One of the key restrictions is that scooters cannot ride on sidewalks as they can in other cities. In the meantime, Mayor Rick Kriseman’s administration began evaluating scooter companies, before COVID-19 forced it to hit pause. Of the eight companies that expressed interest in St. Petersburg, the city ultimately chose Razor and Veo. Among the virtues of those two companies, said city Transportation and Parking Management Director Evan Mory, is that the scooter batteries can be swapped. Other scooter companies will pick up scooters each night in vans and plug them in at a warehouse. Veo and Razor can charge the batteries off site and can even do swaps on scooters, reducing emissions.",https://www.tampabay.com/news/st-petersburg/2020/08/20/st-petersburg-welcomes-electric-scooters/
