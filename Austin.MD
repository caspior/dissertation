# Shared Micromobility Usage Patterns in Austin, Texas

### Abstract
In this chapter, I examine dockless e-scooter and e-bike sharing usage patterns in Austin, Texas, and compare them with the city's bikeshare. I spatially analyzed micromobility trip logs with respect to the built environment and sociodemographics. I used various spatial regression models and random forest models to examine the influence of different factors on micromobility trips. Results show that micromobility usage in Austin increased due to the introduction of dockless micromobility sharing services, while bikesharing usage did not decrease. Shared e-scooters and e-bikes are mainly used in regions served by bikesharing and increase micromobility usage outside these regions. E-bikes are apparently mainly used for commuting, while e-scooters and bicycles are used for short utilitarian trips. My findings suggest that micromobility modes cover all trip purposes, serving residents‚Äô various activity needs.

### Data
All the data in this research obtained from openly available online databases.
- Austin's dockless micromobility trip log retrieved from [the official City of Austin open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Shared-Micromobility-Vehicle-Trips/7d8e-dm7r/data) on March 28th 2019. [The dataset I retrieved](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uHDza25XWuaCml3jeToR6JMtOgbNwScx/view?usp=sharing) includes trip start and end coordinates which are masked in newer trip logs. I cleaned and prepared the dockless trip log with this [script](Aus_Cleaning.R).
- Austin's bikesharing trip log was also retrieved from [the official City of Austin open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-MetroBike-Trips/tyfh-5r8s). I cleaned and prepared the bikesharing trip log with this [script](Aus_Cleaning_B.R).
- From the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/), I retrieved the American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 5-year estimates. I retrieved the total population (variable B01003), sex (B01001), race (B02001), median income by household (B19013), poverty status by household (B17017), school enrollment (B14007), and the aggregate number of total vehicles available in the Census Block Group (B25046).
- Shapefiles retrieved from various sources:
  - Census Block Groups - [TIGER US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2019&layergroup=Block+Groups).
  - City boundaries - [TIGER US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2019&layergroup=Places).
  - Land uses - [the official City of Austin open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Locations-and-Maps/Land-Use-Inventory-Detailed/fj9m-h5qy).
  - Street network - [the official City of Austin open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Locations-and-Maps/Street-Centerline/m5w3-uea6)
  - Bikesharing stations - [the official City of Austin open data portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/Transportation-and-Mobility/Austin-MetroBike-Kiosk-Locations/qd73-bsdg)

  - Bikways were retrieved from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using the [QuickOSM](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QuickOSM/) plugin for QGIS.

### GIS
For the purpose of advanced statistics and machine learning I aggregated the trips by polygons using this [PyQGIS script](Aus_trips.py). I created a 0.001x0.001 degrees grid over the city of Austin and aggregated trips starts and ends for the entire examined period (Aug 16th 2018 - Feb 28th 2019), only weekday morning trips, only weekday evening trips, and only weekend and holiday trips. *More GIS analysis scripts to come

### Descriptive Statistics
Trips' descriptive statistical analysis performed using this [R script](Aus_Descriptive.R). This [R markdown output](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/caspior/dissertation/blob/main/Aus_descriptive.html) presents the code alongside the charts. This [chart](Aus_variables.MD) defines the variables used in this research.

### Random Forest
I used random forest in my dissertation to be able to compare different types of shared micromobility with different distributions. I uaed the 'Increased MSE' parameter to evaluate the importance of each feature to the ridership. I used this [R Markdown](Aus_RF.Rmd) also available in [R script format](Aus_RF.R).

### Spatial Lag, Spatial Error, and Spatial Durbin
I used three spatial regression models to evaluate the role of the features on e-scooter ridership:
- **Spatial Lag** - the spatial component is an addition feature: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y_i = \rho Wy_j">
- ùë¶ = ùúåùëäùë¶ + ùë•ùõΩ + ùúÄ
